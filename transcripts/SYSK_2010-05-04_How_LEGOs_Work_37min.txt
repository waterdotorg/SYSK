Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant with his hair looking mighty fine. Today is a good hair day. Yeah, oh, it's a great hair day. Thanks man. Yeah, you're doing great. You're feeling good, pet people energy and happy. My hair is happy, yeah, Chuck, Josh, Hey man, let's before we get started, we should plug Facebook, Twitter and your mom's cooking. Uh, my mom's cooking is great. Facebook. You can find us at Stuff you Should Know in the search bar, and we're personally interacting. Now. It's not a ghost writer, it's not it's not a net bot. And you'll be able to tell because it's clearly our silly and a in voices. Yeah, and we chuck started the trend that solved a big problem of saying, hey, Chuck here because our profile pictures the album art for our podcast. I don't want people to get what we're saying confused, but me, my words are my words. I don't want them to be like I didn't know Josh was an old crotchety man. Yeah, he's just a young jerk. I didn't know Chuck was in a fight club. Um. So that's Facebook, and we already had a page, but we consolidated him. If you were a fan of the old page, they ain't around anymore. Joined the new one, will you. Let's get with it and Twitter. We're tweeting at s y s K. Podcast is the name of our account and should be funny and fun and I'm trying to follow Cocoa's lead. Oh yeah, well I was anti Twitter until I saw Comen O'Brien's I think I told you that, and they were just they were funny, and I thought, you know what, I could do that? Yeah, well of course you can. You're Chuck Bryant characters. I can do that. Yeah, we're t he in sixty pal that was it. I don't know and I will figure it out alright when it cuts me off in the middle of the sentence. Alright, So we're doing with plug Fest two thousand ten, right, okay, Chuck, Josh, Mr Jake Jillen Hall. He uh, he's finally arrived. Donnie Darko himself. Yeah, h much to his chagrin. He was not a member of the cast of the Fine Fine Picture Hot Tub Time Machine, but he was cast in the starring role for Prince of Persia the Sands of Time or something. Right, Yeah, I saw the trailer for that the other day. As a result, Mr Gillen Hall will now have his own Lego Mini figure. Well, and as a result, he's very buff now you see it. He got all the jacked up for the for the role as the Prince of Persia. Yeah, but again, what we're focusing on here is the Lego Mini figure. Well, but is the Mini figure buff? It has stubble and there's something of a resemblance to Hi, which is that really kind of a new trend among Legos really to look like the thing or to just be branded like that. Well both they started branding or working with licensed brands with Star Wars and they were like, oh, we don't know, this kind of goes against our corporate philosophy letting kids use their imagination. All of a sudden, sales weren't through the roof. And they're like, yeah, okay, so this is what this is the way we put it now. Uh, we let kids imaginations run wild with the added element of storytelling. So which is cool? Lego Lego, the Lego Group is what they're called. From what I understand, it is a pretty great company, to tell you the truth. And we should say, well, this is a no way, in no way our Chuck and I Wilfer Brimley esque compensated endorsers. Yeah, when we do a brand name like this, don't don't think that we're we're shilling because we just have chosen some of these iconic brands to cover because I think it's interesting. It's part of pop culture, it's part of who we are, and people seem to dig it. Yeah. So anyway, now we're not getting rich off the Legos unfortunately. So to answer your question, Um, they started doing the branded, the licensing, branding sets like Star Wars. I think that there was their first big hit. Indiana Jones was another big hit. Harry Potter obviously, but um, it wasn't until they started, um and until they released the Lego basketball set. They started messing with skin tone. Up until that point, if you had a Lego character, even if it was based on somebody, um, it was yellow. And they for a while there, they were a sexual right, they were neither male nor female. Right. In four when they released the first figures, they had a neutral facial expression. They were genderless and race less, but in a in a kind of a backhanded nod to women. The female character was the first gender specific character introduced, wait for it, as a nurse, yeah, for their hospital play set. Right, Yeah, because there's no such thing as male nurses. Right. Yeah? Interesting? Yeah, well that was better than at least they made her a working woman, and they didn't say the first one is you know, Betty homemaker, right, or a homeless person. Yeah, let's start at the at the begin we got plenty of This is a stat heavy extravaganza. Yeah. Yeah, Chuck's all excited. That's why your hair looks so good. It's standing up in excitement. Uh. Legos, Josh, like you said, the Lego group, they employed about five thousand people. They got about a hundred and fifty designers of eighteen nationalities on their team, and they began way back in nineteen thirty two. And I love this guy's name, Old Kirk Christensen. Yeah, and his first name is O. L. E. Yeah, but we are we've decided to refer to him as Old Kirk Christensen, Old Kirk Christensen, do you remember when we went to Tamburg and we found out one of their vice president's name was Odd John. We're like, this is the most punk rock telecommunications firm. We never well, no, it's that Odd is actually a very common name in in uh Norwegian countries. Wait wait, let me just double check my facts. Is Denmark Norwegian country? Yeah, we got that wrong with another ones and we heard about it. Yeah, we did. That's a in podcast correction. We don't usually do that, so Old Kirk Christensen. Yes, he comes up from Denmark, from bill and Denmark, which is where the corporate headquarters still are. Yeah, the first Lego land is still there, that's right. Um. He at first joshed me things out of wood, wooden toys and things like that, little ladders, and he did so until nineteen sixty when the warehouse burned was destroyed in the fire. And I thought it was then that he said. It would have been a much better story if he would have said, oh, I need to work with plastic now, but that's plastic inflammable. Yeah, because he uh, he started working with plastic long before that. Um, and I think nineteen seven plastic not coincidentally, that's the year that his son took over. Yeah, and his son started saying, we need to plastics, it's the way of the future, and they started tinkering around with legos, right well, yeah, the first one, the first thing they made in was the automated binding brick and that was kind of like the first modern Lego brick, but it didn't have the tubes. We'll get to the construction in a minute, but it didn't have the tubes, a little interior tube, so it wasn't things weren't a stable, so it was sort of like just the beta version, right, um, but what was it Night? That's when they came up with the current design. It's called studding tube coupling system, which, like you said, we'll describe in a second. But the cool thing about it is it hasn't changed since then. And so if you have a brick that was made night and you go buy a set today, they'll work together. That is I think one of the cooler facts of this whole thing. I got one for what's the term lego is actually uh an abbreviation of two Danish words, right, leg and goot, which put together means play well, So he combined the two into Lego. What old Kirk Christensen didn't know was that lego in Latin actually means I put together. Really, he had no idea, and I bet people think that's why he named it. That look at you, josh at you so h like I said, or like you said, was when they kind of finished the design of the modern brick and the rest is history. In the in the sixties and seventies, they started introducing other other facets to the to the Legos besides just the brick. For instance, the Lego technique technique but not technique. It's really technic, you know what I'm saying. I'm reading between the lines. It hit the market in seventy seven, and uh Mine Storms Robots made their debut in ninety eight, and that was actually a collaboration with m I T the Technology Media Lab there. Yeah, in the eighties, right eighty four or something. Uh no, late nineties. I think they got together with a starting in like eighty four. Then maybe it took that long. Yeah, I could see that. Yeah. And also their designers. You would think that all of their designers have art school backgrounds or some sort of engineering design backgrounds, not necessarily true, my friend. While most of their designers do have that, the company says that all designers are hired based on their hands on work and a face to face interview, And you don't necessarily have to have an art background. If you are a natural Lego place at designer, that's what you are. Yeah, that means you and I could go and try and do that. Let's let's give it a shot. We may have to, so, Chuck. Over the years, you just spanned a few decades. You know, Legos were named Toy of the twentieth Century by Fortune magazine in two thousand. Yah, I saw that. Yeah, good for them too. Did you have Legos? Oh? Yeah, of course I didn't. What I know. You know what's funny is I noticed that they're only sold in the hundred and thirty countries. I did a little background check, Chuck, right, Um, it's not unequal access to sanitary drinking water that keeps underdeveloped countries underdeveloped. Turns out it's lack of an access to legos. Is that what it is? Yeah? Well, they teach you how to build and construct things and play together. That's all you're all thumbs today, isn't it. Yeah? I mean I was into Lincoln logs and because you know, I was born in the nineteen thirties and log cabins were how we had to do things back in my day. And then I had an erector set, which was pretty awesome. Yeah. I never get into a directors set. Yeah, that was fun. I was kind of been. I was like, look at all those Gears employees, what is this? And hot wheels. I just want to snap box together hot wheel model cars. I was into model cars. Yeah. I would get them and I would then destroy them at some point later on with firecrackers and stuff. We're not recommending that you do that, No, we're not. It's very dangerous. So I was saying you you spanned several decades when you gave those stats, and in the meantime people have come up with, um, some pretty cool uses of Legos have done some pretty cool things with them. There is if you go onto YouTube, there is a thriller done in Legos, all fourteen minutes shot for shot, and it was clearly done in like an old like sixteen millimeter camera and it hasn't made the jump to digital all that well, but still it's pretty impressive. There's some Star Wars stuff on there I've seen recreated definitely. Did you know there's a Boba fette Lego character. I didn't know that, but it didn't dude and Chewbacca, Well there should be icons um in I think two thousand eight, Lego and Kellogg's combined shared the Blindingly Obvious Danger Award from Consumers International for producing the Lego fund snacks, which are gummy fruit choose that look exactly like Lego black. Yeah, that's that's like the bag of glass from the old right, Yeah, or the super Happy fun Ball Yeah yeah, um, and so of course those were discontinued in two thousand and eight. Yeah, that's not a very good idea. And there was a guy out there who's actually in the article and there's a cool picture of it in the article. Who created the um a life size replica of Han Solo frozen in carbonite. Yeah. I got info on that guy, do you really? Yeah, he's he's a real artist. Yeah he is, you can tell. Yeah, we'll get to him later too. That okay. Um. And then lastly, Chuck mc escher relativity. Yeah, you know, the steps going different, the startas that he did it in Legos It is amazing see. That's impressive to me. What come on, hand, strong hands? Please? Can you disappoint me today? That's all right, I'm just over it. How many times can I see that stair thing? You know what? Each time you gaze upon it, you're still like riveted, aren't you? Do? You know the incredibly disordered or highly ordered brain structure requires to see things in that kind of perspective. That's amazing. It's not I'm not saying he's a dummy. I'm just tired of looking at it. I think we should talk about how lego bricks are made. It's a good idea, Uh josh. They start out with plastic granules as a little plastic, yeah, plastic. It is Acra Loni trial Beautadine styrene or ABS. We'll call it a BS, and a b S comes to the factory, well, we'll call it factory. It's a manufacturing facility um in in drows. I have fourteen silos that it are. These things are vacuumed into these silos and all in all a factory has a close to a million pounds of this granulated plastic, right, and all the plastic has already died, so they've got fifty two different colors. Yeah, they don't need to worry about all that. You wouldn't want to have to color it there too. I wonder where that's made initially interesting. I don't know, but I did a little background check and a B S is actually a very safe plastic. It doesn't contain thouts or bispin als. Well. Yeah, because kids, despite everything you tell them, are probably gonna put a lego in their mouth at one point or not, whether it's a lego or a lego fruit too. Right, I could see that meeting though. I sort of see it like, boy, it's really unsafe to eat these, but they want to eat them, so let's just give them when they can eat. And then after they're like, oh, Jerry put in like a sound effect of somebody slapping their own forehead. So what happens from here, buddy, is they take these granules and they use a process called injection molding and some it's all this is machinery pretty much, of course, and they melt the stuff down fifty degrees. Yeah, they're not made by hand. Is that a surprise? Right? The four degrees it melts the plastic, it injects it into the molds and applies between twenty and a d fifty tons of pressure. Right. The cool thing is it's these the dyes that they use to the injection molds that they use. The machining process is so precise. The most it's off is zero point zero zero two millimeters, which is relatively insignificant for the kind of um the kind of coupling system that Lego has used. But first, let's talk about robots. I thought you were good about to drop the knowledge there on that oats do it. You're talking about the interference fit. Yeah, that's what it's called, Josh. It is a tube that sticks. I'm sorry that the stud sticks into the tube, but it's slightly bigger, which is key because that means that presses it apart and allows it to stay together using friction. Right. And the the key to this chuck is you don't need any kind of fastener. It's all friction. It's all resistance. Uh. And that was that change in design that they achieved in nine eight. Before it was it lacked the tubes, I think, so that things would fall apart pretty easy. Now it's like once a Lego stuck, brother, it's stuck, well until you take it apart exactly. But I mean, think of how many pounds of pressure you have to use to overcome that friction fit. Yeah, that's true. It's a lot, like at least two that's true. So where were we pressure? They apply all that pressure, makes it into the little mold, takes only seven seconds and they spit it out. Cool. It goes into a conveyor, into a ben, goes from a bin into the packaging. We could get specific there, but it's not the most interesting thing in the world. I think the cool thing is is um they have robots that way the packages. The reason when you get a Lego set, you get different bags, right, because these designers have said, we need X number of these blocks and next number of these blocks, and they put them in different bags so that you can just throw these um this prescribed assortment of of bags in a box and there's your place set. Right. And then they have robots that way the bags before packaging to make sure they weigh the precise amount. Pretty cool. And if they don't, that's when humans come in. Yeah, humans come in and do a little q A along with machines. Machines perform the drop torque, tension compression bite and impact tests and humans. The Bye test is my favorite. Humans. He's a little beaker. I guess the size of a child's epiglottis maybe to make sure that it can't um a piece, can't, you know, choke a kid to death, because that's a really important step in this whole process. Definitely, And the tests, and one of my favorite stats, Josh is, out of every million Lego pieces made, only about eighteen failed these tests. That is point zero zero zero two. No, yes, point zero zero zero two. I see four zeros. Yeah, you said three and I said four. No, you said three zero zero zero zero two. And the castle walls are counterclockwise. Uh. And this, like you said, Josh, takes place in bill and Denmark. But they have they moved a lot of their manufacturing to the Czech Republic because they were kind of losing money there and laying people off and after the mid nineties, and so they had to make a little cheaper and I guess labor whatever is cheaper over there in in the Czech Republic must be I guess. So that's why it's there now. So check they're making a thirty seven thousand Lego sets every hour. Sets sets, not bricks and UM, I believe I saw a statistic that, um, every seven seconds, another Lego set is sold. Yeah, we have some of those fun stats will save the end all that time. Sorry for jumping ahead though, That's okay. So, Josh, Let's say you wanted to build a Lego project, but not a you know, not a little tiny thing to put in your pocket, a pocket model. Let. So you want to build something kind of big and cool. The first thing you need to do is, well, it depends what kind of guy you are. I'm a kind of guy just dives in and starts building. But that's why I'm not an architect or a builder. What you should do is plan it out a little bit and decide how large you want it, because then you're gonna you know, that'll tell you how many bricks you need, how long it's gonna take, and that determines your scale, and from there you can just kind of move on and be creative. You can sketch it out if you want, if you're into that, or you could use computer software. You can it's pretty awesome. Actually, UM, there's three different types of software as far as I know. There's Lego Digital Designer UM and that's actually available for for use for free on the website. Pretty cool. You can either download it or I believe you can go to Lego dot com and use it. UM. There's also l draw, which is based really a type of CAD computer aided design software UM. And then there is brick Smith that's it on brickman man UM and people use these to do things like, oh, I don't know, create the statue of Liberty with UM a lightsaber, Yeah, that's a fun one, or a scale replica of the Brooklyn Bridge or right, you know, yes, Lego Land had pictures of that. Actually, I'll show you. UM. The thing I thought was cool is when they some tracy for this article interviewed this the one guy that you're talking about, Nathan Sawaya Sawaya, and he he's you know, it's sort of like real architecture and real building techniques, like you should stagger your your bricks for a wall because it's sturdier, and you can put for hollow things, you can put interior columns, and it sort of follows the same rules of standard architecture, which I thought was kind of neat. Right, and this isn't lost on Lego was UM they've recently released the Lego Architecture series. Did you check these out? No, dude, they have, Um, they have a couple so far. They have the Googgenheim Okay, UM, my favorite. They have falling Water. Very nice. Yeah, it's pretty sweet. Um. And they have some uh iconic landmarks. I think the space needles one of them. But it looks pretty slick. What if I was like Frank Woyd, right, I'd come across this table square houses please. Yeah. And we've been trying to figure out how to do a Frank Lloyd Wright podcast and we got i'd say, pretty far into the research process to do it, and I figured out, like, we we can't do this. It's just too visual us sitting around describing falling water like somebody should slap us in the face. Yeah. It'd basically just be like, it's so awesome. No, really, it's awesome, and there's a river that runs underneath. Its awesome. I'm done that, okay. Um. If you're If you're interested, there is a book called the Unofficial Lego Builder's Guide from Alan Bedford and um and a publication online called Brick Journal, and you can get like tips on building big things. There because if you never tried, either you're you know, a genius and your innately able to do so, or you're gonna fail miserably. Well. One guy who was interviewed for the article who did the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Yeah, yeah, as part of like his whole town he was building. No, it wasn't it was. I think it's like Chris Doyle. Yeah, Chris Doyle. He said, he just starts like he he has a rough idea of what he wants to do, but you know, he just goes to town. Basically, That's what I would do. Yeah, it can be done, yeah, but mine probably wouldn't succeed. And then if you are into robotics, electronics that kind of stuff, you can use Legos too. Yeah, they've got new robot versions have like microprocessors and motors and gears. There's a guy who used who used Legos to create an automatic book scanner. Wow. I know, especially if you love books and you love Legos, then uh. There's also a seed launcher that somebody made using Legos that that was pretty awesome to us. Um. And then one of the other cool things I saw it combines Legos with dominoes it's in a mechanical and automated domino stacker legs. Yeah, it looks at the important part. Yeah, I was trying to picture that. I gotta no. I'm like, no, no, it's a playmobile, but it has water running underneath. It's so awesome. So I mentioned Nathan Sawaya. He is one of the pre eminent lego artists out of New York, of course, and he has a traveling exhibit called The Art of the Brick and a website too, and he tours the real museums. And the dude is got some serious talent. I mean, look at that. He did Starry Starry Night mosaic, he Didima statue. Ye oh, he did this one. That one is the favorite one I ran across, and we should probably describe it. Yeah. It is a yellow man looking upward and he's tearing apart his chest and inside his chest he's full of legos that are spilling out, and he's made of legos. You keep leaving that all of this is made of legos. Okay, all right? And then there's this other dude, Sean Kenny, and he is New York based two and I get the feeling that they kind of battle a little bit force well, New York Lego supremacy at least because both of their websites say our studio has more than one point five million Legos. Both of them have one point five million Legos. But I mean how many I could have one point five million Legos and do nothing with them and slap a website together. It's what you do with the legos, not how many you own. Well, let me show you what Shaun's done. He's done um work for companies like Google and Nintendo and JP Morgan and Samsung. And he's been featured on I mean everything, you name it, he's been featured. Has it been featured on Timmy Kim Well? Ah no, But look at this. He did a Yankee stadium. Check that out. And I hate the Yankees. I was gonna say, if I like the Yankees, I'd be really impressed. And he's pretty talented guy too. And he is a member of the what are called the Certified Professionals, and I think there's eleven of them. Now, Yeah, that Lego was actually certified these people as professional artists or whatever. Yeah. I got the impression that um, as he became better and better, he stopped paying for Legos along the way, and this is like ring ring, I need more Legos now, I would think, so I need grain And Old Kirk Christensen is like, okay, all right, Old Kirk, should we go off some of these fun facts? Yeah, Lego fun facts aren't all facts associated with Legos fun? Yeah? I think so. Okay. I like this whole around the world stuff though, because every company has one of these. Wait, first, have you been on Lego dot com recently? Did you go on for this? Yeah? Yeah, it was pretty awesome, wasn't it, like all the little movies associated with each one. I haven't been to Lego Land though, You've ever been there? One of their theme parks that they actually sold. You had a Merlin Entertainment or something like that to Merlin Olsen his ghost made a deal with Old Kirk Christiansen's passed away recently, didn't he very sad? Uh? Yeah? They sold those because they became unprofitable, so they kind of restructured and move some things around. Now they're in the in the red, in the black, in the Black fun facts. Josh, here we go. More than four hundred million children and adults will play with Legos this year. Yes, and I don't know what year they said that was, but it's probably every year. I saw the two thousand nine Investor Catalog or Um Perspectus, I guess, and it said that same stats. So you can put all your money in Legos. I'm gonna put a substantial amount of it actually privately owns. I don't think that's possible. M hm uh. If you built a column, Josh of forty billion Lego bricks, it would reach the moon. Had to count those zeros. I've got one, go ahead. Lego is the largest tire manufacturer in the world. Yeah, little teeny tires, pretty pretty cool. Sat. How many do they make a year? Oh? I don't know. Do you have that stat Yeah? I do, three six million. That's what I get to. Somebody else is in the two thousand nine Investor perspective on average, Josh, they are this is the one. This is my favorite one. There are sixty two Lego bricks for every single person on Earth. Yeah. I like that one too. Uh. Four billion hours. That's the amount of five billion, five billion hours. That's how much people will spend playing with Legos in a year on average, not one person, not per person, by everybody playing with Lego you had a fun fact. I'm not a fun fact. I mean there were more, but I've got one for you. Remember we talked about I'm fascinated with the mini figures, the mini figs as they call them. If you're in the know, if you're one of the eleven certified artists. Um we uh. We talked about how they're they were originally gender neutral, um, race neutral. They were also emotion neutral too, And it wasn't until nine when Lego released their oil started releasing their Pirates set that they realized, hey man, we might need some facial expressions on these people. And they came up with a good figure and a bad figure and an I patched figure and I think scowl and smile to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys. I'm sure from that point on they started having facial expressions for them. Uh. And I think I have one an other Yeah, I was Fisher Price. We should do a podcast on Fisher Price. That was my bag. I was way into that. I liked Playmobile, but I did love Legos as well. Um and then Chuck the Mini figs four billion of them on the planet. There's only six point five billion people um, four billion on the planet technically makes them the largest population group in the world because they're so tiny. That's so cute. And I think that's it, buddy, I think so. I mean, there's a lot more. We didn't cover all of it. No, there is something else. All the press you were talking about them selling Lego Land. They did this huge restructuring in I think two thousand four because they peaked in with their Star Wars sets and after that they actually started losing money, and you said they were back in the black. Part of it is because of their selling Lego Land restructuring the company. But um, one of the reasons, actually, probably the main reason why Legos took such a hit was because of Mega blocks no electronics. Oh, I thought their patent ran out too. That's something to do that. That was definitely part of it. But they think that the you know, Legos are having trouble competing with MP three players or video games are all that. So Lego remains optimistic, Buddy. I have a little tidbit of nice Danish optimism in broken English for you, courtesy of the Lego Group. You ready, yes, I quote, but the Lego group is in no doubt that the Lego brick will continue in future to be relevant to children of all ages period. A world of imagination and total absorption. Period. That sounds like they literally said that and their native language and then just typed it into baby. Well. You know they have the my nephew, uh know what plays with the the PlayStation game they have but Indiana Jones Lego game. Yeah, so they're trying to get a piece of that market too. I think they got a good piece of it. They have a Star Wars game too. I think they have more than the trilogy in Lego. Yeah, they'll be around. They're fine, I think so. Yeah. So that's it, man. If you want to see really honestly, I know we say this every time, like go read the article on the site. Sometimes we've covered the article gone beyond the article. This is not one of those cases. If you want to see just a series of super cool Lego pictures, um, a Lego brick field guide, complete with precise measurements, uh and just a bunch of other information that we didn't even touch on, type how Lego bricks work, because technically there isn't a word called legos, it's Lego bricks. But you know, hey, we named ours how legos work? Right, type how lego bricks work in the handy search bar at how stuff works dot com and it will yield that article right indeed, listener Milk, I wanted to give a little shout out. I had met a couple of fans this weekend. Finally it never happens. What about the Henry Clay people. Well, yeah, but I mean, yeah, sure, you're right, Okay, I'm gonna plug your album. Actually it's coming out in June. They got a new album coming out. But I'll wait on that plug when it's when. Interest Uh. Jerry and I over the weekend went to a play sorts. I think it's so cute you to your dating wildlife theater We're not dating, uh, called looking Glass Alice based on Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and Doug and Lindsay or in the show Lindsay's Alice. And actually there's only five people in the show, so literally one whatever whatever percentage of the cast that is, are fans of the show. And so Jerry and I went with Emily with my wife and I met up with them afterwards in the green room, which was really green, and they were super cool and we're gonna take him out for barbecue while they're here, and uh, I just wanted to thank them. Are they still here? Yeah, they're there. It's like a six week run where you going for barbecue. Well, I was gonna say, like Daddy D's, but that's my friend little Dingy let me yeah, but it's really great barbecue. Daddy d Is is listening your barbecue rocks. I would recommend that. Or Fox Brothers. Well, Fox Brothers is a little more the kind of place you would want to take someone from out of town. But they're kind of into fat mats. They want to get fat mats. Okay, you know that made an appearance in Up in the Air. Yeah indeed. Yeah. Okay, Well that's it for the Atlanta barbecue scene, right, And I also wanted to shout out to uh. Emily had a craft show last weekend and one of her fellow crafters her name was Julie. Oh is it Julia? Now I feel like a jerk. It's just to say both. It's either Julie or Julia. She was really nice and what she does she has bought some of these and I've seen other people that do this now. And I'm mentioning it because it's just so cool those old print printing presses from like the eighteen hundreds. Yeah, no, you don't. She's resurrected these things and they're huge and she does like real printing on cards. Just no computers involved. It's just because those DAGNEVITC computers, I know. But that showed pictures are in front this huge machine and you crank it with your foot and it turns all these gears and just like the punk and she was, yeah, it is very steampunk. But her she has a website called red Bird Inc. Dot com. And I don't know, I think you should support people that like resurrect She said. Machines have been used in like seventy years. Why don't she got ahold of them? People used to have to walk uphill both ways in the snow to use those machines to print.

While driving my oldest son to start a freshman year of college this fall, I was trying to be cool. She put cool in quotes and ignore all the mommy emotions bubbling up so she was getting sad. Thank you for translating. For the hour and a half drive, my son out his radio iPod gizmo and entertained his brother and me with your podcast, starting with the one on a pumpty schemes. Uh, you know how to say it, clearly. We were totally involved, thought provoked, and sparked a great conversation for two. After handling the separation without too much embarrassment, and upon arriving home, I decided to go for a run to help shake off my mommy blues. The inspiration came to look up the podcast and load some on the iPod gizmo, thinking while running and listening, I headed that part. While running and listening, I was struck by the whole circle of my baby teaching me a trick or two as he heads off into the world. Now I get warm fuzzies each time I had out for a run and choose my topic. Didn't it And I look forward to running more than a half for a while, So extra bonus. Now my son, my youngest son, looks for podcast he wants to listen to with us on car trips. She's excited about. Yeah, we're bringing the intergenerational gap together. She says, hooray for more family time with the teenagers. Who knew every time you encourage emails At the end of podcast, I think about sharing our little story. The kids would roll their eyes if they knew, I wrote in, But they love what you do to and we hope you keep up the good work. And Nora mommy for Missouri, help your kids in college. Rolling his eyes at you right now, Yeah, that's what we hope. But there's a tear coming down from his eye as well. He's if he wasn't homesick before, he isn't now. Believe me. Well, if you work out or run or do any physical exertion while you listen to Chucking Me, we want a sample of your sweat.
