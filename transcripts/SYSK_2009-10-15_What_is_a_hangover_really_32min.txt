Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff You Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. With me is Charles Chuckers Bryant, and that means it's the stuff you should know, right, Yes, the over twenty one years old Chuck Bryant. Yeah, that's a that's a big deal for this one. Chuck. We're just gonna go ahead and see o A right now, say that this is about drinking, and if you're under twenty one, you should not drink. Chuck, have you ever consumed an alcoholic beverage? I have over still at c A. If you're over twenty one, you should drink responsively. Yes, don't drink and drive. Um. If you have a problem, uh yeah, heavy machineries a big one. If you have a problem, you can contact alcoholics anonymous. Right, I've always wanted to test that one. Get really plowed and just sit down behind a bulldozer. I always imagine fork lifts with heads, heavy machinery. I go straight to the dozer. So, yes, I have had an alcoholic beverage before. What was your experience with it? Like, did you feel a little light headed, a little crazy, a little get inhibited? I wanted to kiss somebody? Did you end up kissing anybody? I did? I kissed my dog. Didn't you make out with a friend's sister at a YouTube concert once? I did? Were you under the effects of alcohol during that time? I was okay, this was gimea break, Chuck. Did you end up with a hangover that day? Yes? I did the same day the next day? Yeah? Sure? So how did you feel? I felt? I had a headache, I had a poor sense of well being. I've had sensitivity to light and sound, diarrhea, loss of appetite, trembling, nausea, fatigue, you had the whole list, hydration, anxiety, trouble, sleeping, weakness. Yeah, that's a bad hangover right there. That's all the symptoms, you know. The one that always gets me the worst whenever I have a hangover is the loss of the sense of well being. I feel like I am right there on the edge of danger. Everybody's gunning for me. I feel horrible then real, Yeah, it's really bad, it really. I've always assumed it affects my serotonin level. Sure, I didn't see anything in this article about that, right. I thought I was gonna have to get taken to the hospital in Portland, Oregon one time, did you? Yeah? The next day Emily asked me as her friend's wedding. She said, Okay, do you like need to go to the hospital? And I went, maybe I was serious. So let's talk about this, chuck. What are the mechanisms that lie behind the cursed and dreaded hangover? Vice algia? Yeah? Is that the correct pronunciation. That's how I took it. That's the medical medical name for hangover is vice algia. Yeah, And it comes from a Norwegian word for uneasiness following debauchery and a Greek word for pain algaia, which is weird. I've never seen a Norwegian and Greek put together. I haven't either, But yeah, you come up with vice algia? Can I say that the Bible verse two? Yeah? Yeah, there's a Bible verse that talks about hangovers. It's Isaiah five eleven. Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink. In other words, I feel real sorry for you that you had to get up early. If you got hammered last night, truer words have never been written in the Bible, at least translation at least translation there. Um. So okay, so we've got that down. We have the word origin and a Bible quote as this pretty much whenever you talk about a hangover. So what's going on there, Chuck, Well, there's a bunch of things. Um, let's go ahead and start with vasopressing. Yeah, here's here is, by the way, everyone, a cocktail party conversation tidbit. So it's your next cocktail party. You might want to just bring this up. Okay, it might be kind of depressing to bring this up actually a cocktail party. Well, this is the This is how you explain breaking the seal, which I know that you have experienced. It's crazy once you once you urinate, and we're gonna stick to the clinical terms here, Chuck, all right, let's keep it above the breaking the seal. That's clinical. Um. Once you urinate that first time, after you've started drinking, it seems like you just keep going and going and going and you can't stop, and you actually can't, right right. So vasa pressing, that's a pressing. Yes, when you drink booze, uh, it enters your bloodstream and the pituitary gland blocks the creation of vasso pressing, and without this, your kidney starts sending water straight to your bladder, basically right to the tune of four times more than you actually drink. So you drink two fifty milli leaders of alcohol. Uh, you can shoot out up to a thousand milli leaders or a leader? Is that the clinical term to shoot out? Yeah, So that's no mistake. If you've ever had a few beers and you're thinking, Wow, that's so weird, I use the bathroom and now I can't stop. That's v's depressing right there, right, Um, and that's called the diuretic effect. Um. As the the presence of alcohol increases in the bloodstream, Um, you expel a lot more water, right, But you're not just expelling water. Also, we should say this leads directly to dehydration. If you're expelling four times more liquid than you're consuming, Brother, you're getting dehydrated, which is one of the signature results of the hangover. And you get the headache because of that and other things too. You do and the headache. And we've talked about this before. I don't remember where, so we probably shouldn't, you know, try to come up with a time stamp. But um, when you have a hangover, your brain actually shrinks. The next day, the other organs in your body are like you brain, you've got a bunch of water exactly, So a lot of the water um is shuffled from your brain to other organs, causing your brain to actually shrink in size, which pulls on the membranes that connected to the skull, the meningies. And you know, when you have a really had hangover, you wake up and you feel like the membranes of your skull are being pulled in different So when I read this, I was like, oh, so that's what that is. Or like there's a four hundred pound ham fisted man with hair and his knuckles like doing little twirls in your head. You know. Have you ever speaking of breaking the seal? I don't think they did this in Athens at Georgia, but I know some friends at Georgia Southern there were bars there that had the drink till you pee for free promotion? Have you ever heard of those? But it sounds awesome. Basically, it like starting at six o'clock, they monitor the bathrooms and everyone in the bar gets to drink for free until the first person in the bar goes to the bathroom. And I don't think they have that in Athens, if they didn't when I was there. And of course because it's you know, a college, there's like dudes peeing in beer pictures in the corner, you know, just to keep not to not have to pay the two others whether or not there's that you know, contest or promotion. So it's science science. Uh so, okay, that's vast oppressing, right, yes, resulting in dehydration. But when you're um urinating everywhere every which way, whether it's in a beer picture or otherwise, Um, you're also expelling a lot of other needed stuff like electrolytes, salt, potassium, salt, potassium, magnesium, and these all affect how you're like cells function, how your muscle's function, right, and you're getting rid of it without putting it back in. So you're gonna feel lousy. Yes, indeed, you are going to feel lousy. So you're dehydrated, You've lost electrolytes, right, and the electrolyte and balance is really important. Um, if you have too much salt in your electrolyte, and balance is too high, Uh, you die. Um, if you have too little, you get the shakes, the tremors, which I understand is the most uncommon symptom of hangovers. Which makes me nervous because I get the shakes just about every time. The next day, I've never gotten the shakes. What I've never got in the shakes. It also points out in this article that hangovers are subjective, so for each person, you know, they might experience different like oh, I've never had a hangover, or when you get the shakes and you have a loss of a sense of well being. Yeah, that's like Nick Cage and leaving Las Vegas kind of wow. Yeah, I've always been like, wow, that'd be great to have a grocery cart in a liquor store. What a great scene. Should we talk about glacogen real quick too? Yeah, that's another thing you lose. Yes, Um, the glacogen is a is a key energy source and uh, we turns it goes to the liver and turns into glucouse. Is that correct? Right? Well, the liver turns it into glucost and then sends it out like what the heck is going on and just does something and all of a sudden You've just lost all of your energies. I'll just pee everything out just to be sure exactly. Basically, it's what's going on, and that actually accounts for like the weakness the next day fatigue um. And actually that's not that's not the only thing that accounts for fatigue. Um. You don't sleep very well after a night of heavy drinking. Glut to mine. Yes, you have glut to mine, which is a another it's actually a stimulant um, natural stimulant, yes, which is the only good kind of stimulant um. And uh, when you drink alcohol, the production of this natural stimulant is actually blocked. So when you stop drinking e g. Go to sleep, your body tries to make up for lost time and overproduces glutaman. So means you're not getting as gonna sleep exactly. And the next day you also feel restless and anxious. Um, maybe you've got the shakes. That's another cocktail party tip. If you know that if you start saying all these things that your next cocktail party, you probably won't be invited back to the next cocktail party. Though, you know, I think you can wow some people. It depends on how cool your cocktail party. I guess I could see them all saying, now, like, why are you telling us all these awful things about drinking unless my kind of cocktail party, it's great for me. Another one. Screw glycogen, screw bass repressing. Uh so what else, Josh? Well, we could talk about the impurities of liquor, the different alcohols. Yeah. The rule of thumb is the darker the alcohol, the more impure it is, and therefore the the heavier the hangover. Yes, which is why I think everyone pretty much knows that like your worst alcoholics, they like start drinking every morning when they wake up, they're probably drinking vodka. Yes, it's actually a good thing to drink if you are an alcoholic, because you're going to be able to be as close to a function alcoholic as possible. Right. How about that study with the bourbon. Yeah, thirty they did study between bourbon and vodka, and uh, of the people who drank amount of bourbon relative to their body weight had a severe hangover, and only three percent had a hangover when they drank vodka. That's a big white wine, that kind of thing. Um, light run yeah, Jen, Yeah, conversely, dark rum, it's bad white tequila is good. Basically, if it's dark, it's going to kill you. I'm in bad shape then, because I'm you know, I mean, I'm a bourbon red wine beer guy. That's funny. I'm like the whatever's in the glass guy. Right, that's good. You're fun to have the cocktail party because you're not picky. No, as long as you don't run an ice so you know, as long as there's not a cigarette but floating in it, I'll think it. And then sometimes even then, I don't think that hasn't happened before, Chuck. Basically, what I took from this article is when you drink, you are poisoning your body through coningers. There's through impurities in the alcohol, but also through the body's natural processes of breaking down out alcohol too. It Actually there's a there's a byproduct produced when the liver metabolizes alcohol, um called acid aldehyde. Yeah, take this one, because this kind of I read it like three times and I was still a little lost. Okay, allow me please. So basically, when the liver metabolizes alcohol, it produces a byproduct that's a toxin called acid aldehyde, and acid aldehyde is actually more toxic to the body than alcohol. Itself, which is crazy. But we have natural mechanism for neutralizing acid aldehyde called appropriate appropriately enough acid aldehyde dehydrogenase appropriately so that stuff goes and attacks the acid aldehyde. Right. Then we have this other stuff that is called glutoth ione, right, and it contains high levels of a substance called cysteine, and cysteine actually is attracted to acid aldehyde. So the two things combine, acid aldehyde dehydrogen ase and the cysteine in the glutoth ione uh combined to neutralize the acid aldehyde, right, and it does it pretty quickly. Um. You you are going to feel some ill effects, but the less you drink, the easier it is for these two substances to neutralize. Byproduct, is the alcohol metabolized. Okay, here's the problem. You have a limited store of glue tooth ione in your liver, so you use it up pretty quick. And women have even less than men exactly, which accounts for why women tend to have more harsh hangovers and harsher hangovers than men, not just body weight, although that does matter. Um. So you use up your glue tooth ione stores and once you do that, you're blood is just basically circulating this toxic acid aldehyde, while the liver generates more glue tooth ione. Hence you've got this horrible hangover and why ultimately time is the only remedy for it. Yeah, well let's get to that in a second. Let's get to the remedies. Let's talk about liquor before beer, never fear or is it the other way around here? Before liquor, never sticker or sick. There's you're a little bit of truth to that turns out because of it when folk totally um, it turns out that the carbonation and beer speeds up the absorption of alcohol. So if you start with beer, your body's gonna have and then move on to liquor, your body is in fact gonna have a harder time processing those toxins. Even though there's a certain age. My friend Justin, I you know, Justin, we were talking about this a few years ago. Someone was remarking about we had a big night out and like, what was it liquor before beer? Be before liquor? I can't remember, And I just said, you know what doesn't matter anymore, No, you're gonna be hurting. You reach a certain age and it either doesn't affect you or it's gonna affect you no matter what those are college rules. I've noted through my own personal observations, um that at about age twenty four you get as you start getting really severe hangovers. I haven't figured out exactly why yet, but that seems to be about the age when you switch over from I can do this constantly to Oh God, why why I've got the shake cause I have a loss of sense of well being? Right? Yeah, vomiting diarrhea. I don't know why. Maybe that's when puberty ends. There's something to do with hormones still floating around in the body. If you're puberty into then uh, prebody doesn't in your twenties. I pubody ended when I was like fourteen, but it started when I was seven. So seven. Uh, where are we now? Are we talking about vomiting? Yeah, it turns out that that actually does help. And also, chuck, Um, since we have a drinking game based on this and we're talking about hangovers, allow me, okay, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck chuck. That should keep them for a little while. Go ahead, chuck. Uh alcohol, what's going on there is it is indeed better to vomit because when alcohol is absorbed directly through the stomach. And when that happens, you're the lining of your stomach is gonna become irritated and say, hey, thanks for putting all this poison in me. And um, it's gonna start secreting, secreting hydrochloric acid. Right, and the hydrochloric acid is actually what makes you vomit. Um here messages to the brain, says the stomach is really connected to the brain via hormonal signals, which don't necessarily end after puberty, right and um, yeah, your stomach says you've got to get rid of this stuff. And yeah, and it turns out that's you know, you probably shouldn't make yourself throw up because it's dangerous. It could become a problem. If you're drinking so much and you're making yourself throw up, you do have a problem. You should check into a clinic or something. Check into Promises in Malibu if you've got the cash. But it will make you feel a little better because obviously your body is not gonna have to process whatever alcohol is stolen your stomach. So there you have it. Uh, what are we on to now, buddy? I think we're we kind of nailed what it is. So should we talk about some of the cures that people spout. Yeah, there are plenty of hangover cures. Everybody's got one. Yeah, and actually I'm surprised to find that some of them actually are real. Now that you understand what causes a hangover, you can actually identify what will help here a hangover, sure, because really what's going on is you've expelled electrolytes. It's biology you've expelled exactly, You've expelled your natural energy stores. Um, you are dehydrated and your brain is strung. Yeah, so what do you do to make yourself feel better? Chuck? My personal favorite's hair of the dog. Well, that helped me or not? Uh, it will not. You know where that comes from? Uh, it's the Bible again, isn't it. No Nazareth medieval times though, the hair of the dog that bit you. Supposedly, if you got bit by a rabid dog, you would take some of that dog's hair and apply it to your wound and that will cure you. This is the same culture that buried a cat at midnight to cure war exactly. So just like that is false hair the dog, it's faults as well. Having a drink the next day to make yourself feel a little bit better will not work. Might make you feel a bit better in the in the short term, but ultimately you're just adding more toxins that your body is gonna have to process, and you're kind of just staving off the inevitable hangover. Unless you just drink all day again and then you'll have to hang over the following day. Yeah, exactly. Um, unless you just keep going until you die and then you won the game. I was taking a walk with Emily yesterday with the dogs the shows how twisted I am? And I saw it was eight o'clock in the morning, seven thirty in the morning, something like that, And there was a guy down the street from us in the parking lot, you know, cracking his first King Cobra. And I said, you know what, am? I said? Ninety nine times out of a hundred, I see those people, and I think, God, how could you live your life like just getting bombed for the moment you wake up every day? I said, But every once in a while, I think what a way to live? She said? She said, what is wrong with you? Exactly? Doesn't she well, she doesn't let me get up and get drunk every day. If that's what you mean, that's keeping you in line. Okay, she does, um chuck. One of the things that kills me is drinking coffee. I learned a long time ago that if I ever have a hangover, I stay away from coffee. So I'm surprised to find in this article that actually it does have some benefits agreed, which are, Uh, it will actually um alleviate your headache a little bit because it's caffeine and that's a vasso constrictor, so it reduces the your blood vessels. It reduces the swelling, so that'll help a little bit. It'll help cure the headache some. But it'll dehydrate you because it's a diuretic because it's a diarettice, which is how you really got into this trouble in the first place. So stop being stupid. Saying coffee along with a lot of water might be a good idea. Possibly, it's just me, right, Okay. So what else? Uh? Fatty fatty food, fried food the next day. Yeah, which is odd because I know I crave fried food the next day. Cheeseburger, bacon, chili, cheeseburger. It's like two hamburgers. A year and they're on hangover days. She doesn't eat meat beef at all, but when she wakes up with a really bad hanger, she's like quarter pounder. It's very It's strange because obviously she's not the only person who experiences that craving. But that doesn't necessarily help and could actually make you vomit. It could tip the scales when you've got a bunch of hydrochloric acid in your stomach. But it could help if you ate a bacon chili cheeseburger or two bacon chili cheeseburgers before you started drinking it. Why because it contains oil and the fat and the grease will line your stomach and absolutely and in fact, in the Mediterranean they have long drank a little bit of olive oil before imbibing. It's an old thing they do. They're not I'm not either. I like ol of o, but I'm not gonna drink a tablespoon of it. No me neither. Okay, Uh, how about a banana. I'm just gonna pull that one out of my head, out of your banana tree um remedy, yes, okay, loaded with potassium electrolytes. And because remember you lose potassium, which is an electrolyte, so if you can remember, restore the balance. So banana will help your hangover as well. Eggs, yeah, since we're on breakfast, because they contain cisteine, right, which is something that's attracted to acid aldehyde. Right, So eggs in a banana and water would be a great way to start your morning if you had to hang over, Not just water, but water loaded with sugar and salt. Actually, right, because the carbonation it would do the same thing as it did with the beer before liquor. So you want uncarbonated water load of a salt sugar, not a red Bull no, because it has caffeine. Not an energy drink. Uncarbonated non caffeine water with salt and sugar, which I think I just described a supports drink, right, A banana and some eggs or you know what else you can do instead of water? Put some fruit juice in there. Fruit juice. Fruit juice is the kind of the kind of sugar you want fruit toase, and studies have shown that it increases the rate that which your body gets rid of the toxins, and uh, that's a good idea. It also gives you vitamins of course, Okay, what about um say etcetera seta menafin a seeda menafin is uh, well, you you want to avoid etcetera because has caffeine, right, which can help. But ultimately, now and a set of menafin I believe you don't want to take because that can mess with your liver. Ultimately, if you have alcohol in yours, if you take a set of mena fin for a hangover, you are probably going to feel a little better. Actually you'll probably feel a lot better. But in the long run, your liver is gonna fall apart. Yeah, you're doing your body. Damn, You're gonna expel that through your urine. So what you want to do is get a non caffeinated anti inflammatory prostaglandin inhibitor, which is also known as aspirin, which is good. So aspirin will help that. It's shown that prostaglandin actually uh reeks havoc on your body during hangover. So if you take a prostaglandin inhibitor, you're gonna feel a lot better. And apparently there have been studies that show yes, aspirin helps, especially if you take one before you go to bed. And you take two when you wake up, But be aware people with tender stomachs often vomit from aspirate. Right, you know what my curious let's talk about each other's curious. If you got one, Um, surely you do. What do I do? You want to hear mine? Yeah? Mine is? My deal is I can't sleep in anymore. It doesn't matter if I was out till three in the morning. I'm still gonna wake up at seven. It's just the way it is. When you're old, you'll you'll experience this one day. I get up at seven like I normally do, and I drink I pound like three or four glasses of water, take a couple of aspirin, and then I get right back in bed and see if I can get like another hour to a sleep, and then I wake up in at That works crazy well, especially works with advil. If you take a couple of advil and you have even like a half hour, preferably an hour extra to sleep. For some reason, Anville always makes me sleepy. It makes me fall asleep very easily. Never it out why, But yeah, you wake up an hour later and you are set. It's a great one because sleep is only real, real key to carrying a hangover. They say, yeah, well, time, well that that's usually what I rely on. It's time, um, and I pound a few Coca colas in the morning, which is not good for me, but it works, right. And then as burn, is that what they say? Yeah? And then I don't make eye contact with anybody because they're all out to get me. That's how I make it through the day when I have a hangover. Sure, And again we should say, please don't find any of this funny, entertaining, or amusing if you're twenty one years or older. And if you are twenty one years or older, please find it amusing responsibly. Uh. We should talk about some of these over the counter, like anti hangover pills that you can buy. You heard of these, yeah, like Chasers. Yeah, they're they're basically multi vitamins. And here's the deal. Well, some are activated carbon, which can work. But here's the deal. If you if you read on the package, it'll say something like us, um, drink a full glass twel bounced glass of water before you start drinking, and take a pill. And then after your second or third drink, drink another glass of water and take another pill and then do that again. Then before you go to bed, drink a glass of water with a pill, and then wake up and drink a glass of water with a bill. So you're basically taking a vitamin downing tons of water, which is and that's the key is the water. You're hydrating yourself. So it's a bit of a rip off, um, but not necessarily because it is recommended that you do take a multi vitamin the next morning. But just take a multi vitamin, don't pay for some hangover cure. You know. What else helps is to actually be cognizant and not a total drunk while you're drinking. Yes, um, if you drink glass for glass water for alcohol. Number one, it keeps you hydrated. But number two, it also paces your drinking so that your body has more time to process this alcohol. It's not just like bom bomb. You know. I've gotten better at that. Oh yeah, sure, I try to be. If I have like a big night out, I try to be pretty aware of uh drinking a couple of glasses of water here and there, and I always will pound two or three glasses before I get to bed. For you, chuck, it's the way to do it, all right. So there you have it. That's the hangover, right. Yeah. A couple other things you can do beforehand is eat. Obviously, alcohol and the empty stomach is gonna get you there quicker, but it will get you sicker and make you feel worse. So water, what else you say, multi vitamins? Drinking Moderation, of course is the key with everything. Watch what you're drinking, red wine, bourbon. It's gonna make you feel bad. It tastes sugary sweet on your tongue, but it'll make you feel worse. I'm in trouble though. I wish I could learn to drink vodka. I just don't take it. Is so wonderful, isn't nice? I drink gin and tonics occasionally during the summertime months, but I can't drink those. Gin actually makes me crazy. I have a self imposed band on gin. I won't drink it. I don't allow myself to drink it because it makes me nuts. And apparently in the seventeenth century, uh, the UK actually banned or I should say England banned because nuts. Yeah yeah, so jin was banned in England for a little while because people went like I did. Sure, you know, different alcohols through that tequila is notorious for making people violent and the act out of sorts. Never had a problem with tequila, I mean neither. My buddy Scottie has a red wine thing. Completely personality shift when he drinks it, really but yeah, it becomes a completely different person. You know, Alexander the Great died from a red wine drinking competition. One of his soldiers challenged into it and they apparently drank like five million gallons apiece. And Alexander is a great one off and died. Boy. I bet the alcohol back then was rough too, man, Yeah, you know they love their wine. Those are the good old days. Well, if you want to learn absolutely every last detail there is to know about a hangover, you should read this fine, fine article by freelancer Lacey Perry called how Hangovers Work.

Let's do listener, mam, Let's do listening now. Okay, Josh, I'm gonna call this. Uh, don't kill me. I'm just the enumerator. This is a good one. Hi, guys, hope this finds you well. My name is Mark and I live in fish Kill, New York, which is an interesting town. I was listening to the Gross National Happiness podcast and you mentioned the census worker being killed. I thought i'd send an email. I was a Census Bureau worker in two thousand. It was I was a care free nineteen year old on summer break. My friends and I saw the ad in the paper and took the exam and became official enumerators, including a shiny plastic badge from the Treasury Department to boot. He says, So our task was a travel door to door and talked to the people who didn't return their survey. Some people got the short form, some got the long form and former. I remember the forms were assigned at random. Usually the long formers didn't mail him back in, and uh that's who they usually had to a confront, shakedown and shake him down. Uh. People were downright mean when I knocked on their door. One this is a good one. One man asked me to hold on for a second. He closed the door, and within a few minutes I heard the garage door open and he drove out and waved goodbye. Such a jerky move. One woman answered the door with a baby in her arms, shouting something at me. I heard dogs barking, and the next thing I knew, she had let the dogs loose on us, and I was running safely back to my h the safety of my Buick Regal. I quickly learned my lesson, and when someone would open the door and give me the skinny on their neighbors who didn't mail their forms back in, I was happy. And I was even happier when it was a grandma who would offer me a cold drink, Because you know, the old folks, they're just like, come on in, let's talk for a while. Exactly Um I did not know, however, that uh enumerators were killed. I must have missed that part of the training. Uh. Most of the rants would be anti government. They would say I was the man sold to get off their property and all the expletives that go with it. It's not be it's not easy being in enumerator. So give them a shout out.
