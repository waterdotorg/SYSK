Josh: Hey, everybody, it's us and we're here to talk to you about get this our book. We have a Stuff you Should Know book coming out this November and you're going to love it, and you can preorder it now. That's try it. It's called Stuff you Should Know Collen, an incomplete compendium of mostly interesting things, and it's been a lot of fun to work on and we're really, I mean genuinely excited about how this thing has come together. Yep. It's twenties six chunky Harry chapters that are just going to knock your socks clean off. And yes, Chuck, we are indeed proud of this book. It is truly, indubitably the first Stuff you Should note book and it's coming out this November and you can order it now, pre order everywhere you get books, So do that, and we thank you in advance. Welcome to Stuff you Should Know, a production of I Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, Jerry's out there somewhere which makes this Stuff you should ass Oh yeah, old school insect a dish from Robert Lamb. I know it's it's got mouth parts in it, but it's no Tracy Wilson joint, but it's still good. It's super charming. It starts Robert starts this article out from the perspective of a spider who has been dragged into a wasps nest and is about to be eaten alive by a wasp larva. It's pretty interesting. So it's a good article, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. And if you are not familiar with Robert Lamb, then friends, you are missing out on not one, but two, no three, really great podcast that that guy has put out. Um, what is it? Stuff to blow your mind? Of course, the the stalwart science tech, well that tech sort of science plus show. Yes, yeah, yeah, in depth like super deep rabbit hole interesting stuff. And then um uh he did one called trans Human. Yeah, that's a action scripted sci fi very cool. Yeah. And then also he and Joe who he does stuff to blow your mind with, also do Invention too, which is kind of in depth rabbit whole thing about invention. So check all those out, everybody. Yeah, it was fun to kind of get back to basics with a nice little insect cast on wasps and dude, I went outside today on my side deck to let the dogs out, and low and behold, I looked what I was? You said, who let the dogs out? Sorry, you said let the dogs out? So I had to. I thought I had. I thought you were saying wait, wait wait, No, no, I was saying, woo woo woo woo. Oh boy, there was a waspiness on the ground. Okay, good, all right, that's sorry. Did I I knocked the legs out from under that story? It's just a wasp nest. But it was you know, the timing was alive. Oh I didn't poke it to see it. It was. It was not attached. I think it had fallen. So my guess is that it did not have any more wasps residing in it. Man, that's gotta be a real letdown, because it's the middle of summer right now, so they're they're wanting to like grow. There was probably larva in there. Yeah, that's that's really weird. They must have abandoned it then, Yeah, and wasps are you know. I think, you know, everyone loves the bees now because they should because bees are awesome and bees produce honey, and we want bees to stick around. But I think wasps and hornets, which are a type of wasps uh are still just so maligned, and they're the ones that people will reach for their can of raid to spray and no qualm. Yeah, and you shouldn't. Don't do it. Let the wasp live. I'll go ahead and say it. Now, we're gonna say a bunch, but let him live. Totally chuck, thank you. Yeah, we're here to open everyone's eyes to the function and purpose of wasps existence. They're not like mosquitoes. Remember in the Mosquitoes episode, we basically can aluded that there's no reason for mosquitoes around and they just are terrible. Um. Wasps are not like that. And I think Robert does a really good job basically pinning down why wasps get such a bad rap. One is that there stings peck such a wallop compared to other stinging insects. And we'll talk about their there's stings in the venom that goes along with it um, which is so okay, that's fair, Like nobody wants to be stung by a wasp. It's really it can ruin your day. Um. And then also the other thing is is that the if you pay attention to wasps, you realize that they live these really brutal, grizzled existences. Their their predators, and in fact, in their habitats they're apex predators. They're like sharks and lions, but for the bugs and um, sometimes small animals that live around there. Like, I didn't watch any of the videos that I could have because I'm just really over animal death, even if it's nature. Um, yeah, I was when I was doing the End of the World with Josh Clark, Like I went into it just feeling fine about that. That's just nature, that's the way things work. And then one of the guys I talked to is David Pierce, who you and I talked to actually first in our super Stuff Guide to Happiness, but I went back and interviewed him, and his whole jam is like we could actually eventually engineer the biosphere so that there isn't any suffering among animals, and like what we take is natural isn't necessarily have to be that way. And it's really changed how I view like violence, even among animals. So anyway, the upshot is I didn't watch any videos, but one of the ones that I saw, the title was wasp kills baby bird. So that video is out there if you want to see that, but I just can't. I don't. I don't like to see that stuff anymore, you know. I mean I didn't really like enjoy it before, but now it just downright bothers me. Yeah, I get it. That's I live with a person who can't watch anything like that, so I get it. Yeah. So there are more than twenty thousand species of wasp. And like I said, hornets are a kind of wasp. So if you here, I mean you would call a hornet a hornet, but you can't necessarily use them interchangeably. But a hornet is a wasp. And uh, there's a lot of you know, over that twenty thou species. There are a lot of different kinds and a lot of variety as far as what they look like and what they're shaped like, and what color they are and how they like to live their life. But as with every insect cast, we're gonna go over those body parts and mouth parts is in there somewhere, and it starts with exoskeleton, just like all the little insect buddies have that kitan exoskeleton, and in the case of the wasp. They are very segmented out. They have three segments. They get your head, which has got those uh antenna, the sensory antenna. You have those mouth parts because they lick and they bite, and then you have the very cool looking compound eyes and simple eyes, these sort of kidney shaped eyes of a wasp that are very sort of signature. Where are they known as in your Italian accent? Oh? Silly? So if in the Italian if a vowel follows a C, yeah, it makes a chest sound. If a C is followed by an H, it makes a cuss sound. So is this really pronounce Acelli? Yeah? Okay, I think in in like among biologists they probably say oh sally. But since you were doing the accent, sure, I wanted to set you up for a lesson in its appreciate that. Um. Okay, So you've got the head, has some eyes, also has a brain chuck um, which I saw. Supposedly, wasps are among the smarter insects out there. They can recognize each other by face by facial markings. Did you know that they Steve? Are you doing sting anyone? I'm doing okay, Ted? Thanks for asking. It just killed the baby bird. Some weirdo was was filming it and put it on the internet. Well, actually, Steve would say, no, I didn't sting anyone because I'm a man and I don't sting. Uh oh yeah, that's a really great point, chuck um, which we'll talk more about later. You'd find the stinger in the abdomen, which is the third part, the lowest part of the wasp body, but only in a female, which I think this is true for for bees too, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, I don't remember. We've done a lot of good beat stuff. Uh. And then in between those things you've got the thorax, which has the six little legs and then those those really quick flapping wings. Yeah so um. And in between the thorax and the abdomen you have a very narrow waste, which usually is what gives away a wasp. You can look at it and be like, that's a wasp. Um. It's like it's got a corset on. Unless it's a hornet. Hornets are much chunkier, more road ton yah um. But they are, like you said, a kind of wasp um. And actually I think the genus that um hornets fall under is called Vespa. And vespa in Italian means wasp, So hornets are wasps in Italian. Okay, okay, So I think one of the coolest thing about the wasp is the history and the evolution of this thing um along with some pretty horrific stuff that's gonna follow. But about in the Cretaceous period about a hundred million years ago, you had to kind of take a snapshot of planet Earth to understand how the wasp forms. And back then they didn't have all these flowering plants that like we have now. There were a lot of conifers, and these evergreens depended on the wind to spread their seat around. They weren't counting on the insects to do this kind of thing at this point. And uh and we should also mention that ants are a cousin of the wasp, which makes sense. They look kind of ant like. Yeah, I think they finally figured out that ants um evolved out of mud daubers. They're their closest relative, which kind of makes sense. I think they have some ant like behavior. Yeah, and like, uh so the age of the during the Cretaceous period, these wasps were carnivores and they preyed on spiders, and other insects, and as plants started to evolve, they realized that, hey, there's a lot of insects flying around going back and forth, like we're just using the wind to carry our seed around. Why don't we Why don't we get these insects to work for us basically, and they can do the job. Yeah. So that was the rise of the angiosperms um, which is you know, whenever you think of a flower that the bee visits and moves from place to place carrying pollen, that's what an angiosperm is um. Rather than having to just depend on the wind, you can depend on the insects. And so eventually, over time, these wasps, these early predators that used to um feed exclusively on other insects, said well, you know what this this whole nectar thing and the pollen thing, I can get with this. So they started to change their diet from um insects to pollen and nectar. But the weird thing is is rather than developing a way to feed their young from pollen and nectar like honey bees, which I think is another reason people like bees and don't really realize is it realize it is that um they're little vegetarian, vegan animals. You know, they don't hurt anybody. They'll they'll defend themselves, but they don't want to go hurt anybody. They're very peaceful. Wasps are not like that because even though they generally most species of wasps adults eat nectar and pollen, they still kill other insects to drag back to their nest to feed their young, to raise their young on. So wasps are technically omnivores at the beginning of their life their carnivores, and then later in life they grow into herbivores. Yeah, isn't that amazing? It is. Wasps are way more amazing than I realized. Should we take a break and talk about their stinger Yes, all right, we'll be right back for stinger talk. H all right, welcome to stinger talk. I'm Chuck, I'm Josh, I'm waiting. No, I'm Ted. I guess it makes me Steve. Yeah, uh, washed stings are tough. Um, you kind of mentioned early on. It's you know, you get a yellow jacket and that that's that doesn't feel great. And obviously we're talking about if you're non allergic, and it's not like a legitimate threat to your health, and it's just the pain of the sting that we're rating here. Yellow jacket sting isn't great, but a washting and a hornet sting is really something else. It's I feel like it. It hurts more and for longer, and for good reason, because it actually does. Um like b venom is its own thing, shares a lot in common with wasp venom. Wasp venom seems to be this extraordinarily highly developed, like biological weapon, that is, this cocktail of different kinds of compounds that all come together to produce a horrible pain sensation that lasts longer and has a greater impact on your body than anything the actual sting produces. And that's apparently the whole reason behind it is it makes the wasp seem way less vulnerable than they actually are. It seems like they're way more powerful, and for all intents and purposes, they are. But like if you if you could take the venom out of the sting, the sting would would do basically nothing to you. But because that the venom is introduced by that sting, that venom is so potent. It's like one of the worst things in the world to get stung by a wasp. Yeah, and the actual stinger itself was It has a pretty remarkable evolutionary story. Uh So, here's what happens. In the prehistoric times. This parasitic wasp would use this ovipositor that's actually you know, the egg laying organ. They would use this pointy thing to lay the egg on a living insect, Like they would lay the egg on the caterpillar. Then these little larvae would hatch out and then they would eat that caterpillar. The larvae would so at some point, as things are evolving along, Mother Nature says, you know, it would be even better than this is if you could saw open that caterpillar with this ovipause it or and lay eggs inside of this thing. And that's exactly what happened, right, um, which made a lot of sense. And I think there's a lot of um wasp species, there's at least some that still do this, Like rather than build a nest, they just go find an insect host and lay some eggs on it or lay some eggs in it and then just let the larvae eat the eat the inside out. But um, most I think have evolved to kind of use some different techniques, which we'll talk about in a little bit, But the stinger itself stuck around even after it stopped being used to actually deposit eggs into the insects directly. That's right. Uh. And you talked about the venom that's obviously produced in the venom gland stored in a little venom sack, a little bur lapsack inside the wasp body, and then it seeps out. It's got it. It's a barbedlous stinger. It's just like a straight, little pointy thing, but it seeps out through these little valves and coats the entire stinger. And so they store this stinger inside of a sheath and are always kind of ready to use it. And you know, like we said, it's only the females because it was an ovipositor. But the males can pretend like like they'll rear their little butt your way and say stay away from me. You don't know if I'm a male or female. Right, you don't want to look too closely, right, right, Which is just hilarious, But it also didn't that show like a certain level of intelligence as well. I think so, or at the very least, there's too bluff some Yeah, the bluff, you know, that's that takes intelligence, um, which is I think another another indicator that wasps are amazing. Yeah, And like you sort of hinted at the reason this venom is so powerful is has as has a couple of functions. Is one is just the simple function of paralyzing those insects, and the other is as a defense, Like it's it's meant to sting something much much larger and have that thing hurt so bad that it thinks it's hurt a lot worse than it is and like just wants to get out of there basically, right. And then that combined with um, they're very usually very bright colorings because you know, usually the more colorful an animal is, the more toxic. It is just kind of a universal symbol in nature to just steer clear. Um, And hornets and wasps typically are fairly colorful as far as insects go. So those two things combined can teach a larger animal pretty quickly to just leave them alone. And that's kind of how how wasps have have made it this long. I mean they've been around for more than a hundred million years. You know, Um, that's a pretty successful species. Or family of insects. Yeah, and that includes humans. Obviously. If you go poking around a hornets nest or washing nest and you get stung, you're not going to finish the job. You know, You're probably just gonna get out of there. Yeah. Yeah, hopefully you can learn your lesson that first time, you know, or maybe you don't even have to learn it directly, you can just know to stay away from the wah. So what's in that venom? Some really good stuff. I actually found even more stuff than Robert included here. There's some peptides and some enzymes um. Some of the enzymes include fosseh full pace A and B fosse follow pace am bi um and these actually break down the membrane and lipid um coating of cells in your body to basically spill their guts into your blood stream, and that includes neurons. Neural cells can be spilled into your blood stream when they encounter this peptide, which sends a excruciating pain um notification to your brain saying alert Alert, you're in a tremendous amount of pain. That's just like step one. Yeah. They also have nora and effort in there, which stops the blood flow temporarily. And that's why I like that when said it feels like it lasts longer. I feel like that's the Nora epern nor Eperneffer network because it just sort of sits in one place and eventually the bloodstream is going to kind of dilude it away, but it kind of hangs out there for a little while. Yeah, that's just mean. Um. There's also a setyal coline, which actually goes to your pain receptors and stimulates them, right. And there's also histamines um. And histamines are released by your body. They're they're responsible for the inflammatory response, but they also um. The the venom in a wasps venom as includes histamines directly to just to make sure that it gets that inflammation good and good and primed. Yeah. And then there's I was hoping you would take this part because of that word. You want to try it high Laurona days. Well, I use hyaluronic acid under my eyes, So what's that. It's like, Uh, it's an acid. Um, I don't know, I think for bags and it's generally keep yeah yeah, yeah, just to keep your eyes looking sharp. I noticed your eyes look always look so sharp. I thought I thought you'd notice eventually, So, uh, that thing that you just talked about, and then something a day m c d P mass cell degranulating peptide. This stuff actually melts through the connective tissue between cells and basically just sort of it destroys those membranes and allows the venom to move a little more freely than it would ordinarily. Yeah, and the the mass cell degranulating peptide degranulating means that it basically goes to your mass cells and squeezes the histamines out of them. So not only does it contain histamines already, and not only does it trigger a histamine response or release, it goes and gets it out of the cells that normally carry your around in your in your immune system. Um, so it's just really mean nasty stuff. One of the other things I saw that they've just started to kind of um pay attention to is called Brady Brady kinnan and it's associated with chronic pain. So on top of acute pain production, they're like, how about a little dose of what it feels like they have chronic pain too in the mix of all of this stuff. And then Chuck tell me, this is an astounding I got a couple more. One thing is just called antigen five, which is as cryptic as it comes. They don't know exactly what role it plays, but they know it's a very powerful allergen. And then there's a couple of peptides that are antimicrobial, which prevent the wasp from contracting an infection from a prey that it's puts its stinger in. Wow. Yeah, and then amazing, like this is some amazing stuff. Yeah, and I didn't see. I saw that hornets can staying again and again and again, but I don't know about the wasp in general. Is that the case? Yes, definitely, because the hornet is just a type of what so you've got like mud daubers. The kind of wasp hornet is a kind of wasp, And there's like many types of hornets, but they're all wasps, that's right, you know. So, yeah, they can sting again and again and again, which apparently is another reason why they're sting. Hurts so bad. They can do this to you and inject this venom into you. I saw one expert interviewed on a different house Stuff Works article that said, in average of ten times, like if you get stung by wasp, usually you're gonna get stung more than once, and it can be ten times, I guess on average. I don't know if they just pull that out of the air, but they were a wasp expert, so hopefully not. Well, you know, there's murder hornets that are making the news these days in the States. Those things can kill small rodents with a full charge of a sting. Right the Asian giant hornet, which they found I think I think three of them in the Pacific north West that they thought they got rid of last year, but it turns out they survived the winter a queen did. And um, you know, they call the murder hornets because they kill bees and those I didn't know this it was a big because it was just sort of a backpage thing, But in two thousand sixteen, a package of murder hornets was intercepted at San Francisco International Airport and they destroyed that so it didn't become a thing. But they're a real threat to be so that's why people are sort of writing about murder hornets now invading as an invasive species here in the US. Yeah, And I mean like it's really doing an injustice to the hornets unfortunately, because calling a murder hornets, like if you read some of the articles on it, like people will say outright like, oh, they'll they can kill people very easily, and that's just absolutely not true, um, and it makes it sound like they're a threat to humans. Like you said, the big threat is to honey bees, and specifically it's to European honey bees because they haven't evolved around um, murder hornets or Asian giant hornets. Asian honey bees have and they actually have a defense to where when um, the giant hornets show up, like you're saying, they just like murder hornet is a good term if you're a honey bee, because just a few of them showing up at a hive can just destroy a colony in a few hours, and they do it in a really brutal way. They like they decapitate the bees and just kill an entire colony in a few hours. And they do it because they're one of the few species that that um. They're omnivorous, but most of their food comes from meat. They're mostly carnivores, so they're eating all these bees. Basically, they they just carry your baby right off out of its crib um. But they can wipe out a whole colony like this if they run into a Asian honeybee colony. Those bees have developed a response where they'll swarm around one of the Asian giant hornets and they'll flap their wings a bunch and generate heat and they'll cook the hornet alive inside the swarm that was. That's their defense. European honey bees, which make up a lot of the honey bees, most of the honey bees in the United States, they don't have that defense. So it's a big problem. If the Asian giant hornet gets a foothold here, Yeah, and it will pack a lot more of a punch to um. They have about seven times uh potency as a honey bees venom. And as far as the pain scale, they likened it getting stung by an murder hornet is they likened it to like between three and ten, Like if you were to be stung by three to ten yellow jackets all at once. So awful because the yellow jackets thing is nothing to sneeze at either. That's kind of wasp you know. Yeah, I don't get I haven't been stung in a long long time, knock would knock on wood. I got stung a couple of summers ago. I'm not allergic or anything, but you know my story, I told it back with the B thing was when I was hiking that time and I got tagged eleven times in the face and neck when I stumbled. It was one of those underground hives that I just walked over, and you know, you see two or three bees, You're like, oh, what's going on? Then you see tin and then all of a sudden that they're everywhere and you're just running like a moron through the woods toward the river basically. But yeah, I got hit eleven times, and uh, you know that could have killed me if I was allergic out in the middle of nowhere like that. Sure, I thought you were allergic, so we just lied on the episode of Ye. Yeah, it was painful that there was one I think that got the deepest on my eyebrow bone, my orbital bone, and it went straight through and I could I could almost feel it all my bone, and that's the one like A had a hard time getting it out. It was so embedded and it felt like somebody and I know I used the same analogy back then, But it felt like somebody had a tiny little you know, little nails you hang pictures with. I felt like somebody had that poking that bone and they were just tapping it with a hammer in this like regular beat. It is awful. It's terrible. Man alive. Yeah, it sounds like you stepped on a yellow jacket nest because they nest in the ground and they follow you to like they were gonna until I got you going. Huh. I think we should take a break maybe and talk about nesting right after this. Yeah, m hm, okay, chuck. So we're moving on from venom. I think we made our point. Venom from wash is pretty serious. Um, And if you want to avoid getting injected with venom from wasps, you want to learn to know what a wasp nest looks like so you can avoid the wasp nest altogether. Because some wasps are more aggressive than others, and if you get anywhere near their nest, they're gonna be like, let me just give you a little lesson about getting close to my nest, and they'll stay sting you right if you want to get away. So the um kinds of nests that you see um hanging from trees. That's a kind of wasp nest. That's paper wasp nest um. There's mud dauber nests. There's nests in the ground that are yellow jacket nests. Wasps make a bunch of different kinds of nests, and for you to survive in the world, you have to know what each one looks like and be able to sense them out with your your nose. Yeah. When I think of of wasp nest and Georgia, at least, I think of that honeycomb style where it's just a bunch of little tiny holes and it looks like it's made out of paper, because it kind of is in a way. Yeah, I think those are bald faced um hornets or wasps, I can't remember which one. The wasps, and they actually chew up would fragments that they'll get from, say like your deck or if your kid only has those old timey wood toys, they might chew those up if they're in the yard. And then they take that and turn it into actual pulp like paper, and they spit it out and make a basically a paper mache nest, which is pretty impressive. But that's why those things look like their paper mache because they basically are yeah, and they're light like paper machee. Um, and they're fairly intricate if you look at them. They have some of them have what looks like a little roof eaves. Um. They can be there, like I said, super light, so they can be dangling from a really small sort of thread like, uh, I don't even know what you would call it, just a thread. Yeah, it's sort of like thread. I guess suspension cable. Yeah, suspension cable exactly. We'll go with that because it sounds like it's a little stirredier. Although is that the kind that you found in your yard today? Yeah? I found let the dogs out. Yeah, I found one of those, uh, laying on the ground when I was a kid. You know, the big hornets nest that are the big sort of um. Also sort of looks like paper machee, but it's more gray and it doesn't have the little holes. It's just got one central entry point and it's about as big as a football. Yeah. Those were sort of like country decor. Did you ever know anyone who had one of those in the house? Yes, murderers, serial killers, So we had one. My dad climbed up a tree to get one of these. It was emptied, thank goodness. Uh. And we had that thing, you know, mounted on a log above our fireplace for years. Really. Yeah, it was weird, that fascinating. Yeah, I don't remember which kind that is. And I mean, I've looked at so much stuff about wasting. I think it was the white faced hornet if I'm not mistaken. Okay, is that who it is? All right? You can get pretty big in there. Yes, and they're big, um, the like you said, the size of a football. Their nests can get pretty big. Um. But yeah, they that's a good one to avoid. I didn't realize that they were aggressive. Huh. Yeah, you don't want to mess around with one of those nests. You don't want to go poking it. From what I saw, the mud daubers, which actually make theirs out of mud. They're the ones that you know, those tubes that usually come down from like the ceiling, down the wall. Those are actually mud tubes that the mud dauber has made. And mud daubers, we should say, they're basically two kinds of wasps in the world. Wasps and hornets, social and solitary and solitary is exactly what it sounds like. They it's just a single wasp of female living on her own. Um. She'll mate with some male wasp and then go off make her own nest, either burrowing into the ground or if she's a mud daubers, she'll make a mud nest. So when you see a mud daubers nest, like stop and be like, I respect that because that was made by one single wasp on her own with zero help whatsoever. She made that nest um, which I just find extremely impressive, by chewing up mud and just slowly but surely building it, spinning mud out onto the wall. Yeah, and if you're a social wasp, you are. It's sort of be like and that they're working for the queen. Um maybe more than one queen even, But you have these male drones that are there to mate, and you have these female workers who build the nest and they hunt for food and tend to these little larvae. But it's basically all about getting the queen to live through the winter to the next season. Um. Like, they will all leave the nest, and I think I think the queen is the only thing that overwinters, Isn't that right, yeah, yeah, the queen. Yeah. If they raised queen larvae um, the queen will will live until the next winter and start over again, basically creating eggs of sterile female workers to help her to hatch and then help her build up the hive, raise um male drones or now is the drone the worker, No drones, the male that's just used for reproduction, right, um, and then eventually raise little queens UM. So it's pretty pretty interesting, especially as far as like social insects go. There are very few species of um social wasps and hornets, but the ones they are that are pretty they're they're highly social. Even among like social insects, they have pretty intricate complex societies like UM. Some of these the social wasp nests I think UM, including yellow jackets, will have multiple queens and there's one head queen who has basically beaten up other queens to establish her dominance, and then she'll have the most eggs, and then the next layer down will have the second most eggs, and so on and so forth. And that takes like a certain amount of cooperation to maintain and respect that type of hierarchy, to keep that society functioning the way it should, especially considering you have to to reinvent the wheel every year after winter comes and goes. Yeah, yeah, absolutely, uh. And they talk to each other too, in a way. They communicate, especially if there's a threat via pheromones. So that's why you were more likely to get swarmed rather than just like if you're an actual threat to a to a nest, they can send a signal that says, hey, everybody, this jerk over here has gotta This kid has got a stick and he's coming at us. Let's get him. And if they if they die, actually they release that. It's like a byproduct of their death is releasing that same pheromone. Basically they turned into like Harry Dean Stanton in Red Dawn where they're like, avenge me. Uh, I guess I have that one written. I guess you didn't see the video then of the the tarantula hawk, since you're not, no, but I've seen one in person. Actually, yeah. The pepsis wasp is known as the tarantula hawk because they lay eggs inside of a paralyzed tarantula and the larvae eat the tarantula from the inside out. And I was like, I gotta, I gotta see this, and of course on YouTube there is a pepsis wasp battling it out with a tarantula and it's no match. Uh, and it paralyzes this tarantula and drags him back like a great distance. Yeah, one thing pulling this tarantula across the ground, but which is much much, much larger. But the tarantula, like you said, it is no match. And even among humans, I think that tarantula hawks um sting is like a four out of four on the Schmidt pain scale, Like it's as bad as it gets. Because you know, why don't They asked Mr Schmidt, how bad is it hurt? And he's like, oh my gosh, it's terrible, he said, yeah, um, but yes. And they're very bright blue and orange too, which is another another indicator, like stay away. If you see anything it's really colorful, just assume it can it can mess you up pretty good. Don't like tantula hawk. That's the kids don't like that colorful frog. So but even if they even if it's not a wasp taking down a tarantula and laying eggs inside it that eat the tarantula from the inside out. Um, almost all wasp species, if not add percent of wash species. Um. They like we said, they raised their young by by paralyzing other insects, dragging them to their nest, and laying the eggs nearby, leaving the bug to be paralyzed and still alive. When the egg hatches, and larva crawls over and starts eating that bug alive. And this is one reason why wasps have such a bad rap, because it's just such a brutal circle of life. It really is, yeah, especially from the perspective of the insect. And apparently Charles Darwin said, um, when he witnessed this happening to a cute little caterpillar, that it made it difficult for him to believe in an omnipresent and beneficent God, because what kind of God would allow a poor, acute little caterpillar to do that. The thing is that Charles Darwin, I mean, he liked to puts around in the garden, but he was not a farmer. If you're a farmer, you're probably kind of happy to see a wasp larva eating a caterpillar, because caterpillars eat your crops. And if you ask me, Um, this is where we get to the part about the roles that lost playing in the ecosystem, and why you shouldn't just go willy nilly killing them. Yeah, I mean they'll bring in wasps. Farmers well sometimes if they have like a insect issue, because the wasp is going to take care of that naturally and you won't have to use you know, insecticide and stuff like that. No. So, Plus, also, bees are usually kind of finicky I saw as far as what they'll pollinate and what they won't. Wasps are not at all finnicky. They'll pollinate whatever. So they're non selected pollinators, which make them like you could use them to pollinate any kind of crop, which makes them pretty helpful. And so they control other crop destroying insects and they also pollinate crops too, so they are pretty useful. So that means that you shouldn't just go around killing them. I think we should say it again. You shouldn't kill anything except mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. And you also can't say, well, they're they're a threat to humans because I looked up some stats. Chuck, you ready for this? Yeah, you're not gonna get killed with from a wasp, are you? No? I mean yeah, but no, you're not so combined bees, wasps and hornets, and hornets are just another type of wasp. Is that so? Yeah? I hadn't hurt um. They kill about sixty two Americans every year from anaphylactic shock. Right. By contrast, three hundred Americans die from falling off of ladders every year. In the UK. Get this, between two thousand six two thousand and seven, eight people died from bees, wasps or hornet stings. I'm including bees here, by the way. And then in Australia, where you would guess that half the human population is killed off every year by bees and wasps and has to regenerate every spring. Now, between two thousand and two thousand thirteen, there are only twenty seven deaths total for the that thirteen years from bees, wasps, and hornets things, which is pretty astounding. But it all goes to say, like, don't listen to the murder hornet wrap. The hornets and the wasps aren't out to kill you. They don't want you anywhere near their nests. But they're not like trying to to to wipe out your family. They just want to be left alone. Basically, the murder hornet wrap now here is a hornet and it's here to say, come to kill people in a major way. I think I can't wait to re listen to this one because I'm pretty sure you said that they kill sixty two million Americans every year. No, I think you did. I might have been hearing things. It might have been a computer glitch. Just sixty two, Okay, six to the two. I really am curious. M On if you said a million, so we'll find that will be an Easter egg for us only. Uh so, yeah, don't kill the wasps. If you have what you think is a wasp problem at your house, you really don't unless it's you know, I mean, if you have a really big wasp nest, like right above your front door or something, I could see maybe a case being made for removing it, having it professionally removed. Or if your kids are playing out back and there's a sinkhole from a yellow jacket's underground hundreds of yellow jack and if you're allergic, getting that removed too. But in general, like wasting and after you, they don't want anything to do with you. They're not aggressive towards humans unless you're come poking their thing with a stick. Um. I love this, Robert says, and this takes like nerves of steel, and he's like, if one lands on you, uh, don't pay avoid swatting it or making swift movements and just kind of sit there and it'll quickly fly off. Like I don't want to kill a wasp, but if a wasp lands on my arm, and I'm not gonna be like, all right, little fella, you're just I'm just gonna give you some time, moves me along. No, I would. I would freak out and flail. I wouldn't swat at it because I feel like I would get stung for sure, but I would definitely do you know that, right? You got to try not to do that. You have to listen to Robert and don't pan good luck. Every time I see don't panic in the wild, I just assume that it's a reference to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, don't you. Yeah? I think so. So there's there's standing still. That's one thing when one lands on you. Um okay, that's that's great. Things you can do to keep them from landing on you, though, or to not wear white and yellow outdoors, Yeah, okay, I don't like white and yellow. They white yellow doesn't look good on me any way. Um, but those colors attract insects. Um. You don't want to wear perfume because you may confuse them into thinking you're a flower. Um. If you have your garbage can uncovered, don't stand next to it. You want to cover your garbage can, especially if you're us. We gotta we got a stink. I always call it the stinkiest garbage can in Atlanta. This is pretty bad too. It's a lot of years of cat litter. Oh yeah, that's a stinky. And then you will You can take down nests yourself if it's below sixty degrees fahrenheight or fifteen point five degrees celsius because they're probably dead in there anyway, so it's a good time to take it down. But for the most part, we're just going to go ahead and say, don't take down a wasp nest that you want out of your yard by yourself. Just don't do it. Hire a professional. There are people who will take money in exchange for coming to to get a net us out of your yard. You can give them money for that, and they know what they're doing, so you can feel good about that about hiring them, and it also supports local business too. Yeah, and don't get that uh was ray that sprays from like twenty ft away and just go home and like attack these nests with poison. Just don't do it. No, stop killing things? What else you got? I got one more thing? You have? Anything else? Okay? So in Japan, it always circles back to Japan, doesn't it chuck if it's quality and good, including their um um, including the Asian giant wasp as well as yellow jackets and some other types of wasps. Japanese culture or culinary culture loves wasp larva. But to get wasp larva, you have to go out in the wild, find a wasps nest in the summer, and then take it back home without stung, and raise the larva yourself. And then when they're ready to go, you harvest them and eat them in the fall, which is pretty interesting in and of itself, right, it gets even more interesting than that because to find a wasp nest in the woods, what they do is they take raw fish. Japanese love raw fish, but they share some of theirs with um wasps and they leave it out his bait. And then when a wasp shows up. They'll take chopsticks and a little hunk of this this fish meat that they have a string tied too, and they'll hand it to the wasp, and the wasp will fly off with the hunk of fish to take back to its larva its eggs, with the string dangling, which makes it easier to follow back to the nest. And after doing this a few times, they're probably successful enough that they track the wasp all the way back. They don't lose it, and they find the nest, and then that's when they take it home, intend to a larva, and then they eat it in the fall. That sounds familiar for some reason. I might have heard that before. Isn't that uh amazing? Well, that's all I've got for wasp Chuck wasp out. Uh So, since Chuck said wasped out, that means it's time for the listener mail. I'm gonna call this Adam. I think you were wrong and Josh was referencing they might be giants. It's a long winded title. Okay, Hey guys, in your episode how We Almost Got Rid of Polio, you read a listener mail that referred to how Flame Thrower's Work episode. However, I'm somewhat sad that the reference wasn't made for the they might be Giant song? Is Stanboul not Constantinople? Josh made the statement, and it was a wonderful wasted opportunity. Well, that's exactly what we're talking about, right, Yeah, I said, not Constantinople. Yeah, that you were talking about that they might be giants song? Right? Yeah, of course you just didn't. He doesn't get me. He just didn't say. Hey, by the way, that's that they might be giant song. Hey, everybody open up for the spoon feeding. Uh, just thought i'd drop you both the line. I love the show and enjoy listening to it daily to and from work, especially the wit and dry humor. It comes over your hands, all right, he said, it's very much my style, so much so that you aren't sure if that was a joke. Even told wow, this is getting very meta. You both make my commute tolerable and enjoyable. Thanks, guys. That is from Adam P and Gulfport Mississip. Nice Adam for you. From now on, whenever I make a joke, I'm gonna add waca Waca'll be just for Adam. Thanks a lot, Adam. We appreciate that. Thank you for listening to us and for lending us rag on you. We do it lovingly and jokingly. We hope you know. Of course, if you want us to rag on you, well you send us an email and see what you get. Look up and see what you get. Uh.
