Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should Know? From House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant, and that makes this stuff you should know you paranoid or something. I just looked over my shoulder for Chuck Bryant. No, that's that guy's going after me, the real Chuck Bryan. Don't don't worry about him. Okay, he's taking care of Yeah. Good, go back to being Armonton's area. Supposedly that was the worst one ever. That's what Matt Greening said. I think so, Matt. You told me once that, Matt Greening, it was asked if there was one Simpsons that he could just take a mulligan on and just not exist. You told me. I don't think I did, because I've never heard that. That's disappointing because I love that episode. That's the episode that I based my episode on. Yeah, we've had this conversation, you know, all right, well you just make up Matt Graining quotes, right, Um, Chuck? Yes, speaking of TV? Uh, did you ever see the season three episode of Magnum P I called forty Years from Sand Island. No, you haven't. I've seen them all, dude, No, tell me what it was about, and I'll verify that. But I've just said yes, Well, I mean I saw every Magnum, so I assume I've seen it. Well. This one starts out in a Japanese internment camp in Oahu called sand Island, and um, there's a murder a guard. One of the guards murders this, uh, this internee, I guess, and so what we means she worked at the camp for fighting with that college credit um, although there are some similarities between internment camps and internment um. But this, this internee is murdered by this camp guard, and uh, Higgins is writing a book forty years later about this incident, and some mysterious things starting to happen, and somebody's out to whack him. Some Magnum's got to solve the case. Who was Higgins the guy who killed the person? Did it haunt him years later? No? I don't remember how he learned about it, like maybe from hearsay or something like that, and he was doing research on it. I don't know why he was writing a book on it. I don't remember the episode there forty years from Sand Island season three. It was a good one, like they'd really hit their stride by then. But the crazy thing is Sand Island really existed. It was a Japanese internment camp and it didn't make this list. Strangely enough, where was it? Who? Yeah, that wasn't in here, was it? No? But it is. It was the main internment camp where um, Japanese and Japanese Americans were intern during World War two. Because something that I think probably especially a lot of our younger listeners haven't found out yet. Uh, the United States interned a number of its citizens unconstitutional lead during World War two. You know that one Simpsons where there it's the soccer one? Uh give me more. Well there they go to see this um their professional soccer team or whatever, and they're in the soccer stadium. Margin looks around and goes, I can't believe this used to be an internment camp. Oh that's good stuff. Yeah. There are a lot of shelters, temporary places set up, and a lot of people were moved through them. There's a lot of misery and heartache. Let's talk about it too. Simpsons, Uh, and a magnum in the first six minutes. That is stellar. Yes, all right, let's talk about it, all right, Josh. On December seven, very awful thing happened, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor by surprise. I didn't know what's coming, and Michael Bay ultimately made a pretty bad movie about it. I actually went to see that and left after the attack, just because that's you know, that's what I was there for. I didn't need to see the love story attached, all right. Moving on, President F. D. R at the time said, uh, we're gonna relocate about a hundred thousand Japanese and Japanese Americans put him in uh what he called concentration camps. Yeah, which he wouldn't use that term today for these now they're they're associated with Nazis exactly. And Jane mcgrathroy wrote, this went to a lot of length to um to differentiate the two a little unnecessarily. I mean, I don't think anyone thought of them as the same thing. It was a fine article, Jane, it was, But that was not how it started, is it, Josh. He started out a little slower and it sort of grew from there. Yeah, Well, there was apparently intelligence that even before the attack on Pearl Harbor UM in the on the Pacific coast, especially in areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, there were UM spy rings of Japanese and Japanese Americans UM being set up. So right after the attack, UM they rounded up about fifteen hundred aliens that they suspected of possibly being engaged in spionage, and not just Japanese, but also like Italians, Italian Americans, Germans and German Americans, the people who brought us some liberty cabbage and stuff like that. All right, so he reviews these people, finds out what they're all about. He hasn't paraded in front of his desk, and he's like that guy looks okay, not that one. Well that's sort of what happened. And uh, some of the aliens were released and some were sent to temporary detention camps. Canada. If you think you're off the hook, you're not, yeah, because you did the same thing. Yeah, twenty thousand people UM. And I wonder how much how much of that had to do with Canada UM bowing to pressure from the US. I wonder. I wonder which makes it even more shameful on us on both parties. But so a couple of months after Pearl Harbor, and this was I guess after the review of right, Yes, that's when he issued the Executive Order nine zero six six, which gave the military the power to create zones. And what it says here is zones in which any or all persons may be excluded. So that means they did it like really indirectly. That's what I thought. They basically said, like, you can't live here, you can't own property here at the very least, you can't be here right now, but you happen to live here. The military has designated this like as an exclusionary zone, but we have this free housing over here that you can come take advantage of um. And I think that's how it was kind of sould at first, But it became very obvious that the Japanese didn't have a choice in moving to these camps. That's the impression I have. That's the impression I have too, So let's let's talk about them. They set up first assembly Areas, which were temporary camps from February until the summer. Right, first generation and second generation Japanese Americans, you say, which is first generation, and Nissa which is second generation. And they actually got folks from both coasts, although it was largely West coast. It was almost Yeah, it was mostly West coast because that's much closer to Japan than the East coast, of course, and that's what the intel supposedly said that they were living anyway, and they were also I saw a government propaganda film from when they started this. Camps were being built, so it would have been made in like nineteen and Um. Basically they were they were saying like we just you know, there's just too many Japanese and these you know, large populations, they're not spread out because they left people alone in Atlanta and Dallas and New York generally, Um, because they were diffuse. Uh. One of the reasons they went after the West coast because they were huge concentrations of Japanese Americans and Japanese that they were just worried about, you know, them coming up with problems. That's what the propaganda film said. If they said problems, they didn't say problems. That was what they're conveying. One of the problems here with how this went down was they only got a couple of weeks. Notice, at most they had to leave their homes with whatever they could carry and go to these assembly centers. Can I, um, can I tell you one more thing from the propaganda film, So when they're for they show them putting up signs that might as well say like you didn't get out. It was basically like if you're if you are Japanese or second generation Japanese, you you can't be here. You have to go meet here at this time and we'll process you. And basically processing meant here are some government enlisted lawyers and they're going to um they're going to help you basically sell your home and business and whatever for a loss. In most cases, you don't have a choice. Now did they force all that or strongly encourage them as far as like selling their they forced it. But the propaganda film, which I recommend anybody seeing, I cant remera what it's called. But um, it's only like ten minutes long, but man, they pack a lot into it. They say like the Japanese and Japanese Americans are happy to help out. They're happy to prove their loyalty. Basically they're doing their part by getting off of the West Coast. That's how this propaganda film made. It seems very interesting. But yeah, a lot of them were forced to sell their stuff, often less than market value, right, So they're starting off on a bad note to begin with. And this is just what the temporary housing. Then in UH late summer they had finally set up ten of these internment camps ready open for business. The w r A, the War Relocation Authority UH put up places in California, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, and it gets Hawaii. In Hawaii, even though that didn't make this list. Sand Island, Sand Island, and they were guarded, they were bar wired, they had hospitals, they had basically everything you need to live, schools, little forms of government. Yeah, there was no UM, there was no Basically they put them in the in the camps, guarded them so they couldn't they weren't allowed to leave or um come in and out freely. But inside the camps that was up to the Japanese to form their own democratic self government. And they did this kind of like block captains and things like that. Subpark conditions. Yeah, definitely, even the w r A said that at the time, UH kind of like army barracks. One family per room. You got you caught, You got your mattress, you got a stove in a light, you got some blankets. Right. The problem was, or one of the problems was that these barracks, let's say there were five apartments in the barracks, they were separated by four walls, and the walls didn't go all the way to the ceiling. So there was like no privacy in a very private culture. Oh yeah, sure, So they started wrecking their cultural heritage off the bat basically much uh, public laundry, public bathroom facilities, mess hall. So they got a small allowance of money foreclose personal expenditures and the like, but it was pretty dang low. Um. And so if they wanted a more comfortable life in there, they would dip into your personal savings. Right. So that started wrecking them on the financial front as well. Yeah, and the low wages also, um had a strange indirect effect Chuck, And that Um, the parents and the kids who were old enough to work, we're making the same amount of money. Yeah. One of the things that you know, one of the ways parents exert controller of their children is like, I make more than yeah, not, we make the exact same amount of money. So that wrecked the family home front a little bit more. It definitely eroded authority among parents. And you know, I mentioned that they could dip into their savings. Not the case with um first generation Japanese because their assets were actually frozen, so they didn't have the option to spend their own money. But you say that they earned and put in the bank, right, Okay, So like you said, they tried their best to do normal things set up like baseball leagues. Evidently the Japanese love baseball. Yeah. I saw a m I saw an art um exhibit at a Smithsonian why was the Renwick Gallery in DC, and they had um. It was called Garmin the Art of the Internment camps. And a couple of things they had were some like handmade baseball jerseys for the leagues that they set up there. Yeah, that's pretty cool. It was very cool. There's a lot of really interesting stuff that bet is that was that still on display right now or it just ended January? I looked it out. I was gonna tell everybody to go everyone in d C at least, Well, I bet it'll set up somewhere else, So keep it out for it fingers cross. Um. One of the other ways that sort of wrecked the cultural family front was that Japanese traditionally eate together as family family time, meal time, and now that uh, the little boys and girls were living close to their friends, they like, we're really hot to go over and eat dinner with their friends. So that fractured the family even more. Yeah. Plus, also, if you didn't want people to know you were arguing with your wife, you better not do it in the barracks, because again, the walls didn't go all the way to the top. That's right. Um, there's just a lot more insight into your neighbors private life than than the Japanese were ever comfortable with. Yeah. I don't think any culture would be fully comfortable with those conditions. I agree. But yeah, so let's move forward to three when the w r A says, you know what, maybe we should let some of these folks out to go to school and work, and let's make a questionnaire and base their release on this the results of this. Yeah, so you have that questionnaire, Well, there's there's a lot of personal information, like, um, you know where are you're born? Uh, can you give five character references, five work references, and there's some other kind of odd questions like, UM, name some newspapers that you subscribe to a regularly read UM, what are your hobbies and interests? Uh? Would you volunteer for the Army Nurse Corps? Would you denot's there for Japan? What are some other hobbies of your interests to you? They just slipped that denouncing emperor of Japan in there, Yeah, and a lot of people hopped at this opportunity. They saw what it was and they said, sure totally. All I'm an American citizen anyway, So yeah, that's fine, I'll denounced the Emperor of Japan. One thing we I don't think we really touched on, Chuck. There was a hundred and twelve thousand people who were relocated to these internment camps. Seven thousand of them were, no doubt about it, American citizens. UM. So yeah, there are a lot of people who were happy to sign this UM pledge of allegiance basically or pledge of loyalty, and those who did were released. There are a lot of people who took it the opposite way. Well, they were released just to go to work in school at the time, right, they weren't released released, were they I think, Uh yeah, I think that that did gain them early release or release before other people. UM. Yeah, well I think they were allowed to leave for work or school, but they weren't like released release at that time at least okay. UM. There were some other people who took great offense to these questionnaires UM and refused to sign them. And there was actually a big protest at tool Lake. UM. And even if they were citizens, American citizens refused to Yeah, there are actually people who renounced their citizenship in the face of being forced to sign this loyalty oath on top of already being a citizen. So they actually verbally renounced their citizenship. At tool Lake there was a mass protest UM. And there was a guy named Jimmy Americatani who had a pretty cool UM documentary made about him, Cat the Cats Americatani. He was at tool Lake, he denounced the citizenship. UM. He was finally released from the camps when they were closed uh and basically went to be homeless. And he didn't realize that his citizenship had been restored in nineteen fifty nine, and as recently as like two thousand two, he still thought he was like an illegal alien living on the streets, almost like a Japanese drags kind of. Yeah. Yeah, he was like, that's exactly what he was, like, was a Japanese straggler of the camps. Basically. Wow. Yeah, it's really interesting. It's it's worth seeing. But I love it. He state in the United States in New York. He's actually he was a master artist. He was really good. Yeah, you should check it out. Well. But yeah, most if not all of the people who were in this protest at tool Lake and renounced their citizenship. Um. There was this one lawyer who went back and said, dude, they did this under durest. It shouldn't have been in the camps in the first place. Let's restore their citizenship. And I think most, if not all, had their citizenship restored years later. Yeah, alright, Josh, let's go to ninety four December. Uh, this finally comes to an end after a lot of public outcry. Uh, they were allowed to leave, Um, but they couldn't exactly just jump back into their regular life in many cases because a lot of times their business or property was taken over or neglected in shambles. At this point, and an alarming amount of money. Yeah, four hundred million dollars in financial losses by the Japanese internees in two thousand nine. That's about five point two billion, but I think lower now because I looked up at different calculator. It's at four point eight So maybe it went down since two thousand nine. Deflation. Deflation good? So what was what's the problem here? Why is this a big deal? Why should I care? Is this constitutional? Well? Yeah it is. It was extremely unconstitutional. UM A panel later found out right, And of course I was being facetious with that. By the way of UM, there was this girl named mits Sue Endo who was a twenty two year old. She was born and raised in Sacramento. UM had never been to Japan, couldn't. I don't think she could speak or read Japanese. And she was interned at one of these camps UM and she basically appealed. She she appealed for a writ of habeas corpus we've talked about before. It got denied. She started appealing up to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court got ahold of it and was like, this woman should be granted unconditional release immediately. And that opened the floodgates for every other US citizen who was intern there UM. And then eventually that couple with the popular outcry against it because people even while it was going on, Americans everyday, Americans who were saying, this is horribly wrong. Yeah, it was pretty controversial. And so finally, even before the war ended, the camps were shut down. But this wasn't before some people died. Oh are you talking about the on the island. That's different, but we can talk about that. Well, let's talk about both. At the UM the art exhibit I was telling you about the Renwick Gallery, there was this guy UM named Shura Obada and he did some really cool ink illustrations. But one of the ones he did was an old man doubled over and there's a dog nearby, and there's the fence and then the mountains in the background. And if you read the caption beneath the explanation, it's of an actual event that took place UM. An old man who was deaf was chasing a stray dog, trying to catch it, and apparently a guard was shouting at him forgetting to get away from the fence. Old man was deaf, didn't hear it. The guard shot him to death. This is in one of the camps. Yeah, and I mean, like if this is unconstitutional, it never should have happened, then just that alone is makes it horrific, you know. But then there are a lot of other people who who died of um, just deplorable conditions in the Aleutian Islands, right, Yeah, I mean it wasn't just rounded up in the United States, as we found out when we read this, Uh, Japan was apparently we got word that Japan was going to attack the Aleutian Islands Kiska and A two, so before they did so, we said, let's get in there and round up Ah, I guess is it was it locals, Yeah, the Nihan, the Unan Gas, Union Gas, un Gas. Yeah. I don't understand is why. I mean, they weren't Japanese American, they weren't American. Why did we round them up for their own protection? Supposedly? Well, I think not even supposedly. I think that was the whole thing, that that we were pretty sure the Japanese were going to capture this island, which they did, so we were we evacuated them from their home. Okay, Well, sadly what happened though was eighty one of these uh unan Gas were rounded up and they saw U servicemen burning their houses and their villages down, so the Japanese couldn't use them. So the Japanese couln't use them, and that that that was just when they were setting sail for their new home, where like, you can't stay here, and we're gonna take you someplace where a lot of you are gonna die, okay, So they took them um further into Alaska and basically used an old fish canary, uh an old fish salting place, herring salterry, and then UH an old mine of some sort, gold mine camp. That was like riding out that these were the temporary quarters for these people. And um out of eight one chuck four people died of things like um consumption, UH the damp TB which are all I think the same thing. Well, they didn't have plumbing, they didn't have electricity, they had no toilets, they didn't have the food was poor, they didn't have winter clothes, and the water was tainted. And this is where they sent them. Yeah, unbelievable. So the inning Gecks basically said, okay, well, we're just gonna take matters into our own hands. They built themselves, their own quarters, they raised the church there. They it was pretty inspiring. And again this one wasn't like interment against I guess it was against their will, but it was supposedly for their own safety. Well that's what they said about the Japanese Americans too, we should point out, right, And we should also say, well, let's talk about that panel in ninety eight that found that that was not the case at all. Yeah. Well, before we move on, though, we should say that the union, the Union gacks twenty five of the men actually joined the American Armed Forces. Despite the fact that they were rounded up and putting these camps and some of them died, they still supported America to the extent that they would fight and died for the country. Pretty amazing, is very amazing. All right. So now we flashed forward once again through our little time machine to when redressed payments. Uh, we're basically on the table. Right. In nineteen eighty, Congress created um the Commission on Wartime Relocation in Kerman of civilians, and they came to their decision in nine right, and their decision or their judgment on whether or not I was constitutional or what was the motivation behind it was that it was racism, pure and simple racism in wartime hysteria, right, um. And basically they said, yes, there was evidence that, um, there was espionage networks on the West Coast among Japanese and Japanese Americans, but the people who were calling the shots about interment didn't know that at the time. So we owe these people a lot of money? Is what they came up with? How much was it in reparation? So I got some stats for you. Eighty two thousand, two hundred and ten people got paid twenty thousand apiece. Now, remember when I said that the financial losses, um, let's go back to at least because that's when they were paid. That would have been two point six billion dollars lost. One point two billion was paid out, so less than half of what they lost they ended up getting back. So in other words, the twenty grand didn't cover you know, squad didn't course squad. And in n the SIP Civil Liberties Act was put into effect. They released another four hundred thousand for payments. And part of the deal then was and I think this was the first Bush signed, this one ten the ten in tournament sites were made historical landmarks and in the official apology. Um. That was part of the deal. Um was the money an official apology and then funds for an educational foundation. This is what they wanted, they got it. Who Yeah, well, I wish I could say that's a happy ending. I think probably the better legacy of it, though, is that we very sadly learned a really hard lesson, and that is that we can't get swept up in racial hysteria and profiling among our citizens. Um. Yeah, in the midst of an emergency, and I think that Um. I wonder if that helped calm people keep heads cooler. Following nine eleven. Yeah. I know. One thing though, is that they never found any Japanese American guilty of espionage in World War Two. There you have it, Yeah, there you have it. Japanese internment camps probably one located near you, especially if you live in the Western States or Arkansas or on Sand Island in Oahu right, um, or if you've ever been in Santa Anita race track I have that was an assembly camp? Was it really? Wow? Yeah? I want some money on some ponies there one time. Oh, there were Japanese people who were kept there against their will. I didn't know that that's true. If you want to learn more about Japanese internment camps, type in interment I and E R N M E N T in the search part How stuff works dot com. That means it's time for a listener mail. All right, Josh, we're gonna catch people up on our our sergeant John Walker. Oh yeah, because we did. We did all this on Facebook, but we didn't really do it on the show, so many people might not know that, Uh, staff Sergeant Walker was shot in the line of duty in Afghanistan pretty severely. Was not a flesh wound as they say. And I won't get into the details of how that went down. We'll pick up afterward with this email. Guys. The first couple of days after I was in my own coma from shell shock and a concussion, doctors put me on heavy meds due to surgeries in the pain. When they went to test my brain functions on the Wonder machine due to the meds, it basically showed me as brain dead as my body was not reacting to the stimuli. Uh, don't worry, folks, he's clearly writing his emails, so things turned out okay. Which we're getting too. After I was out of the coma, I was in too much pain, so they put me in a medically induced comma, which basically meant just more meds. Afterwards, they tested the d m R. I again showed some problems, but they said it was only temporary. Um Through this all, my brother in law sent me to your Facebook page, and if you remember, I posted this, lots of people logged on, and regardless of political affiliation and how they feel about the war, there were very concerned about Walker, which is pretty cool. I was not able to finish reading the comments on the post you guys made. I kept tearing up from all the heartwarming comments from the strangers who didn't even know me. It's really nice of you guys to do this, plus really nice of everyone who posted. I found it very kind that people posted outside of that post and kept asking for updates. Uh So, moving on, He's in the States now, recovering pretty well. He has just been promoted again from staff sergeant all the way to sergeant major and he says he will be promoted to second lieutenant and will receive the Purple Heart the Army dis e Whig Service Cross the Soldiers Medal, Army con Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army and Air Force Presidential Unit Citation, Army Good Conduct Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal. So he's getting loaded up on his chest here for being shot exactly. Been placed on medical leave. My family wants me to discharge as this is my fourth stint, but I will not do it. There's danger out there and people need protection. I will be providing protection. I plan on one more tour and then after the Army, I planned to join law enforcement. So he's doing awesome. He's on the Facebook page a lot. He if you remember from many months ago, he was the one who was teaching English uh to the kids who spoke Farsie through our podcast and he said a lot of these children from the school came and visited him and the hospital and made him cards and stuff and so pretty cool story. That is a great story. So we just want to catch everyone else out there who's not on the Facebook page up. He's all over the place too. He's on Twitter as well, and he started actually a stuff you should Know Army page on Facebook. Facebook as well. Yeah, he's he's poaching our peeps. Know he's a good guy. Yes, he is a very good guy. Thank you for keeping us up to date. Sorry stuff, Sergeant Walker. Um, and we're glad you pulled through, Sergeant Major. Thank you for keeping us up to date, Sergeant Major Walker, And we're glad you pulled through. We were worried there for a little while, weren't we. It's pretty scary. It was like right around Christmas for years now, it was after and his brother in law was emailing me this stuff, saying like, we don't know if he's going to make it. At one point, Yeah, it was scary. It was. Well, we're glad he's fine, Um, right, recovering. Yes, Uh, it's pretty bleak outside still these days, chuck. So let's get some nice beach stories.
