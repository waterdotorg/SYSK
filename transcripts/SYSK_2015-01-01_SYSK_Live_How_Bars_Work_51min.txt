Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant Lives and by fogs hany stander planning? Oh yeah, bad's the good stuff? Can qua rap for everyone? Alright? Good man? Yeah, I have to say alcohol makes a difference in the energy level, a huge difference. Popcorn popcorn and diet coke just does not cut it. Now. Uh So we're here today, hanging out, just doing our thing, and I have a question for you. All right, Chuck, have you ever been to a bar? Yes? Yeah, yeah, I know you have. That was this set up? Um? Did you realize though, that while you were at this bar, you were in one of the oldest businesses known to human kind? The oldest profession. No, not the oldest profession. This is the oldest business known to human kind. One of bars have been around a very long time, they have, but not as long, it turns out, as alcohol does anybody who's listening to our How Beer Works episode. It's entirely possible that bread was invented as a starter for beer, which is pretty awesome. I mean, that makes humanity as a whole, like a pretty awesome species. Um. The thing was, booze was around for a very long time before bars, So there wasn't a place where you just went to go drink. You just drank everywhere you went pretty much. Yeah. You literally like you could drink at work, you could drink at school. There would be meetings and civic meetings. You would drink there. But there wasn't an establishment with four walls set up just for drinking at this point, right, You would drink it like this Saturday night ritual sacrifice or something like yeah, as you do. Yeah. And so the first bars then that really kind of pop up are around the turn of not this past millennia, but the one before. And you can find them in Italy in a place called Pompeii. And these aren't necessarily the oldest bars in the world, but they are one of the earliest established bars. And they were basically, um, hot snack bars. They're called it sounds gross there, it does hot snacks. Hot snacks. Yeah. Well it's like you know, chicken wings or poutine is a hot snack. That's a hot snack. That's the hottest snack. That's yeah, because they took a hot snack and then poured hot gravy. And what is a cheese that's hot? Right? That's hot? Uh? You know this was more like I imagine hot olives hot. I don't know, hot tomatoes. The point is that there was there was wine at these places, right. And actually, if you've ever been to Bombay Pompeii um as I have, you can see these places. They're like bars or countertops with holes cut out, and they put like jugs of olives, poutine and wine and stuff. And you would go down to this this area and hang out and drink and hang out with your neighbors. And sure like, look at malt pvesuvius over there. It isn't it lovely? I think it's ever gonna do it that. We're good. Don't be ridiculous. You were drunk. So again, the an't these are the earliest bars, but they're among the earliest um. And the Romans were really kind of big with bars. In home itself, there were lots of bars like there were in vesuvious Um. But the Romans also did something else that led to the spread of bars, and they built roads. Well, first of all, they conquered the world and then they built roads, and along these roads there were inns for travelers, and in the ends there were bars. Yeah, because if you were tradesman on a Roman road that it was scary at night you might get mugged and killed. So they would do their trading and traveling during the day and then they would stay in these ends at night. And just like modern American business travelers, what else do you do when you're on the road like that, You got to the hotel bar and you drink your face off. And that's what the tradesmen did in ancient Rome. You celebrate not getting murdered that day on the Roman road. I traded some spices, I didn't get killed, So bring them the gropp up exactly. And um, so out of this came the taverns, the ends, the pubs, like they basically said, that's great, you've gotten in, but we've got a little town and we could use a couple more, but we don't need in, so let's just stick to the to the bar part those are, that's how those evolved out of there. But um, the oldest bar in the world probably it's definitely the oldest bar in Ireland, but it could possibly be Guinnesses investigating as we speak to the oldest bar in the world right now. Um, it's called Shawn's. Has anyone ever heard of Shawn's in Athlone, Ireland. You've been there, it sounds pretty neat. He's part of it. That's enough to cheer. Um it was. It was founded in a nine d c and actual, real live, no joke. Vikings used to get wasted there and this place is still around, Like you can go get wasted where the Vikings got wasted, which is pretty amazing. I guess they would They would eat mushrooms and then kill people all the way. They would go berserk, remember that. So the coolest thing about Shawn's actually is, um, it predates the town that it's in now. It used to be for two hundred and fifty years just Shawn's Bar and this old Roman road. And apparently people got tired of like having to drive home after getting wasted at shawn so they just built their houses around it. And that's where the town of athlo And, Ireland came from. That's true, and uh, it's interesting fact. That's not true. Interesting fact about Shawn's Bar. In nineteen seven it was owned by boy George. Yeah, the boy George, not the one you were thinking of. Boy George. Yeah, I guess you. I don't know. He thought it was a safe investment. It had been there for you know that many years. But he got out of it. He's like, nah, I think he went broke. Someone in the first show said he went broke. It's well, that's mean, yeah, but it could be true. Yeah, I think it's true. So we did a little research on your town and we were very pleasantly surprised to find that, you know, your town was founded on a bar, right, y'all know that gassy Jack. That's right, Gassie Jack. Within twenty four hours of landing and founding gas Town, Gassy Jack built a bar. That's the first thing he did. He's like, I'm gonna have a town. He woke up the next day. I went, I'm gonna build a bar. Yeah. And he built the globe, which is not there. It's it's It was at the corner of Walter and Carroll Streets. I think in Gastown a water live corrections, so water and Carol. Hey, I said, Carol, right, come on, give me some points there. Well, the way I look at it is we just say that these people from having the email us right, it's Walter. This is actually kind of efficient. Yeah, this is cool. Should just do every show live. So there's there's a there's a statue of Gassy Jack and um, and we think very highly of him because of the fact that he built a bar. But he did things back and we found out it's not gassy like you think that it was gassy because it was talkative. Did you guys know that boring? Yeah? I was all pumped up. I was like, this guy farted a lot and it's like, just let that name. He was clearly proud of it because he let them erect a statue that says gassy Jay. It was just because he talked a lot. And they do have a statue there right, Yeah, at Water and Carroll Streets. So Vancouver itself would have older bars than it does if like Atlanta where we're from. Uh, it hadn't burned down. Uh And what was that eighty six? Quickly rebuilt of course because you're a strong city. But um, in Victoria we have the six Mile Pub eighty six not too shabby, not to ship and Garrick said, pub also in Victoria eighteen sixty seven, except that it's not bad as far as old as drinking establishments go. No. But uh, guessie Jack kind of thwarted convention by building the bar first and then the hotel because that whole tradition of having a bar in a hotel survived long past the Roman Roads. Yes, there were pubs and taverns and everything, but that didn't mean that there weren't bars in hotels any longer. Um, and that made its way over to the New world, which is here, that's all of us, and and along the way. One of the reasons why this whole custom and and um tradition made its way over was because you could make a lot of money being a bartender because you probably owned the bar, you probably owned the end that the bar was in, and you're probably making the booze that you were selling, so you were just making bank. So they the bartenders actually were a among the wealthiest of the socioeconomics states. Yeah, they were, you know, the upper tier of society exactly. Uh, in America, we have the same thing, like Josha. We had ends that had the bars. But then in eighteen thirty two, the U. S. Congress said, you know what, let's pass a law. Let's call it the pioneer in in Tavern law, And let's just say you don't have to stay in the hotel to get drunk there. You can just come in, get south and get on your horse and and crash it on the way home. I guess somebody just clapped for the pioneer in in Tavern. Liley. Yes, we won't stay here, right, But it was a cool on and it changed everything because all of a sudden you could just have a bar in a place where you can just go drink. Yeah. And the industrial age changed everything too, because place like say New York City became this this beacon for immigrants to come to and and be skilled laborers and working factories. And they brought with them their love of of bars, and they said, what the hell is going on with this town? Like where are all your bars? We want to bar here? Bar there, Bar there, bar there? We want to bar there? Where are all your bars? We know how to make whiskey too, which exactly like like just leave it to us, we'll open the bars. Um. And very quickly bars sprouted in neighborhoods and became customary, like pretty much overnight in the United States. Yeah, and they were because sort of like they are now in like the best towns are the center of civic life. There were where people congregated. It was the center of politics. In fact, back in the day, it was untoward to actually have legitimate advertisements and political campaigns. That was no good. What you could do is get everyone loaded on election day. And they even had a name for it, which was swilling the planters with bumbo, and bumbo was a rum and the planters were the voters. The voters and basically whoever got the most people drunk on election day one like almost literally that's the case, Yeah, which is pretty solid. George, George Washington, who's the father of our country. He uh, he made his first bid for the Virginia Legislature and lost because he didn't he didn't cotton to that kind of thing. Didn't swill the planners with bumbo. No, he did not. And he learned his lesson because the next time he ran for the legislature, he spent something like eighty percent of his entire campaign fund on booze on election day and he won big time. He figured it out, that's right, and uh, to this day, well, it became rife with corruption. Of course, anytime you're getting people drunk to vote for you, eventually they're gonna evolve as a nation and say, yeah, no, maybe that sounds such a good idea, So let's outlaw drinking on election day altogether. And for many years that was the case. And in a couple of states, South Carolina and Kentucky in America, they still won't let you drink on election day. Yeah, the bars were closed, which is weird and archaic. And it's on a Tuesday, which is strange. But they have like really efficient quick elections just over and everybody's like, let's get this over with. The bars are closed, this is awful. Yes, you're elected, they do. They're drinking at home. I think on election day probably we'll be back to stuff you should know. Live in Vancouver, right, Josh, right, hold your horses, everybody, you know, buddy. I was just hanging out with my very cool nephew over the holidays and he is a budding photographer and he showed me his website and I said, that looks like a Squarespace website and he said, uncle Chuck, it is awesome, and it looked great.

Uh, so we're in New York City. Let's getting the way back machine. We bought a full size way back machine so we can. Oh, I gotta go back to New York City. It's eighteen twenty and the first celebrity bartender is uh, well, he's not born because he's old by that point. But his name was Erasmus Willard, and he worked at the City Hotel in New York and he was famous. He had two really meat traits that turns out to be a celebrity bartender. He's ambidextrous, and he had a photographic memory, so he could make drinks with both hands and recognize your face as you're coming in the door and be making your drink with one hand and recognize his face and then we say his Because only men were allowed in bars at this point, by the way, it's right, ladies, it gets better, it gets better, get better with us. Eventually women could go to bars. I don't know if you knew that. So Harasmus Willard was the first dude, and he sort of paved the way. He was known as the best known man in the city, and he paid the way for Josh's hero, my hero Jerry Thomas. Yeah, come on, give it up for Cheritos. So Jerry Thomas like that guy. Yeah, everybody's like, you can tell us more about him? Why is it your hero? Later? Explain? They're always asking us to explain. Um, Jerry Thomas was this dude who was flamboyant. Yeah, yeah, I'd like to say he had a little little liberace and um, you know, definitely he would tend very flashy. He would tend bar with like diamond rings on both hands, diamond stickpin and his tie. Uh literally a rat on each shoulder while he's tending bar. And this guy rats and this guy his signature drink was called the Blue Blazer, which was Scotch and I think a little bit of sugar and some water, but you would pour it from wine glass to wineglass on fire with rats on your shoulders and diamonds sparkling in the flames and like this is Erry Thomas, which is pretty awesome. Like that in and of itself warrants mentioned, you know, hundred and fifty years later. But he also had the brains and the creativity to back it up. And basically, in Jerry Thomas, you have everything that we know about cocktails and drinking and going to a bar in this one dude's person. Yeah. He you know, he Barten in New York for a while, had his own place, and then the Civil War started and he was like, I don't like all this killing of each other's thing, So I'm gonna go out west and do my thing out there for a while. And you teld me when that Civil war is over, and I'll come back to New York. But you did. He spent some time out west, and yeah, and Saloons, I guess, applying as trade and that's right West Coast, and uh, that is a place you just got pandered to. The West Coast is a thing, and that's right West Coast. Good job, and that what they do that works? I think that's East Side. I thought it was this early on. I was so bad at it. This is this is West Coast, clearly, right. So he goes back to New York and he says, uh, you know what, I'm gonna write a book I'm gonna I'm gonna spread the joy of my craft. It's gonna take like everything that he's learned through his travels, all the inventions he made, and puts it into a book. Yeah, all the way back in eighteen sixty two. It's really the first bartenders guide ever. Uh, you should do the honors here because it's the greatest book title. Well, there's three titles. It's called The Bartender's Guide, or How to Mix Drinks or the bomba Bants Companion. I like companion, that's for sure, especially when you're like wearing diamonds on both hands and rats on your shoulders. It's the bomb of Ants Companion. So he had a lot of flash, we said, and not necessarily, Uh, the other bartenders that followed in his footups footsteps didn't really necessarily go that far. But what he did do was he provided craftsmanship and artisanship to bartending for the first time, and he was the first guy to really So you know, you should take pride in what you're doing here and making a good drink. Yeah, and dress up. We'll kill you to dress up a little bit, but I kill you to put a rat on your shoulder for once. So they don't bite much. Uh so, well, and we'll talk a little more about Jerry Thomas and what he did. But while he's working, this is like the boon the hey Day, the initial boon of drinking. Basically before then everybody drank and they drank all the time. But this is like going and getting a drink was a cool thing. You know, it's legit. But if you listen closely, while Jerry Thomas is mixing his blue Blazer, there's a drumbeat in the background, and if you listen, it sounds really like stupid and wrong minded, and and if you really focus it on it, you realize it's the drum beat of the temperance movement, which managed to get prohibition passed, not just a hard country, but in your country. Yes, let's all booth the Temperance movement. What a bad idea. And the Canadians knew it was a bad idea way before we did, because you had prohibition for a very short time, and this sucks. It's just stupid with you had it for a couple of years during wartime from I think nine and nineteen twenty. It was provincial otherwise, but you had a very nice Canadian loophole. If you have an ailment, you could get booze. You could go to even during prohibition, you could go to the doctor and say, Doc, I got I got the I got the shapes, I got the shakes. I need's the booze bad? I got the I got the six, I got the I got the cold, I got the Jimmy lings. I'm awake, Doc, I'm awake, Just give me some foods. And then Doc would be like, yeah, you had to. Day was a boost and uh in Ontario in one year in anyone have a guest on how many prescriptions for booze just in Ontario? Everyone? Where do you want? What do you say? Four hundred thousand? No, double, it's eight hundred and ten thousand. People were so sick that they needed both in one year, just in Ontario. So we were really impressed by that number. So, as as is our usual want, we went and looked at the Canadian Census and we found that eight hundred and ten thousand, the number of prescriptions in that one year in Ontario alone, was one tenth the entire population of Canada. And we're like, wow, the numbers really head up. Canada is pretty cool like that's when it really broke on us. We're like, all right, you were a very sickly people. We needed build better. Uh. And it is funny to see a play out all these years later with the marijuana clinics. It's like, it's the same thing. I got the sis, I'm awake, I got the shakes. Oh you need some marijuana. I don't eat enough. You have the neuropaths here right, Like you can just walk in and and talk to a dude, a neuropath, and they'll say, oh, well, you clearly need some marijuana. So this is a very dark time, not only for bartending as a craft because it was just sorting to become like a legitimate thing and respectable thing, but for booze period. Prohibition was bad because there were a lot of bars, but they just weren't legal. I think they were twice the number of prohibition pars that there were legal bars. Yeah. There in the US there were thirty thousand speakeasies, which was twice the number of legally licensed bars before prohibition was clearly working. So clearly prohibition was just a great idea all around, because the mob was like, yes, come here, we can take care of you just look for the green door and you'll find a speakeasy. Yeah, and uh it was bad for bartending though, because whoever the bartender was was who was the guy who could get the booze, and who could get the booze didn't necessarily know anything about booze, for one, or making good drinks, and it wasn't necessarily good booze. Like it would literally kill you or or um strike you blind. You heard the saying abot this will make it go blind. It's really made people go blind, like to a lot of people. That's where the phrase comes from. There was there was a batch of industrial alcohol that I guess the US government thought was going to fall into the hands of bootleggers, which it did. Um, so they decided to poison it and a lot of people died, and the American government was like and like walked away. It's not it's not very much talked about. We found out about it, so we're like telling everybody is that is messed up? But I think in uh, what is it chuck alone? People died from bad liquor, and that's not including people who are paralyzed or struggle. Yeah, what that means actually just occurred to me. That means twenty five thousand people died, and twenty five thousand more people were still like, I'm gonna give it a shot, all right, what are the chances, you know, anything to take care of the jimmy legs? Yeah, I got the shakes. So the other cool thing about prohibition is since all the rules are out the door, basically women said I'm going to a bar and you're not gonna stop me. I've come a long way, baby, So women were now congregating in bars, and men all of a sudden went, this is great. I don't know why we never allowed women in here, because we've just been getting drunk by ourselves and sort of looking at each other and going home at the end of the night. And that's sort of weird, which, which, as we'll get to, eventually became a tradition at bars. That's right, call me home alone. But at least there were women now and they were getting south right along with the guys. Right. Great, But it was because there weren't any rules. It was like a speakeasy was operating illegally. So a woman would come to the door and be like, what are you gonna not let me in, you know, like you're not even supposed to be serving booze anyway. Yeah, and there's another unbelievable fact here that Josh dug up that I still take issue with. Apparently, up until the nineteen eighties and Alberta, where is that that way? This way? Is that? Easter's that way? Apparently in Alberta they had laws on the books and up until the nineteen eighties that still were gender specific with bars. I know, hey, man, we're pretty telling you guys about it. We didn't create the laws. Well, I think it might have been. I don't know if it was in Forest. Surely not, because they had the sixties in the seventies too, right, catching up toward the eights. So prohibition happens, right, and um, everybody's like that was a really bad idea. Let's never do that again, let's repeal it, and um oh, let's go to war. So World War two happened, and that actually had a pretty significant effect on bars too. Apparently up here they sent all of your guys over to Europe to fight, and your guys came back and said, there are these pubs in Europe that are awesome, so let's build them. Everywhere. And then after that, like, yeah, we got the pubs. How about some sports bars too, Let's mix those in a little bit. And that's pretty much how things went for a while in Canada. In the US, um our guys apparently all went to the South Pacific and came back and we're like tiki culture, and tiki was huge in the United States. Not a fan here. I don't understand this at all, Like, how do you not like tiki? There's like fun uh shirts right, All the drinks are good, very very easty stuff. Uh. The restaurants that you go to to drink are fun. It's just nice. Yeah, I'm a pub guy. I don't I don't see why you have to differentiates anyway. So that's how things were in the US and Canada until there's a very dark time that settled over the land. Not as dark as Prohibition, but pretty close. And this was the age of the fern bar. Does anyone know what a fern bar is? Have you ever heard of that? You know, how you go to Red Robin and there's like tiffany lamps and like terrible drinks and all that stuff. Well, you can thank the invention of the fern bar for that, Like, have you ever seen a Three's company? Remember the Regal That was a firm bar and in the seventies they were all the rage. Yeah, there was a guy in San Francisco and he went by the name of Henry Africa because that's a super fun name. His real name was Norman hob Day and he opened his bar Henry Africa's because Norman hobb Days is this really bad name for a bar as well. Plus also he apparently all the time wore safari gear in like a helmet. Yeah, And so he went by Henry Africa and Jerry Thomas were sort of similar. I think they were both flamboyant. One ruined things, one did great things back. So he opened up Henry Africa's. There was another one in San Francisco too in the early uh it was a yeah in the nineteen seventies and name is called Perry's. And they were like, you know what, let's get rid of these classy oak dark bars that everyone loves because they're awesome, and let's put in ferns and tippany lamps and fat chairs and let's bring the lights up and let's serve nasty drinks mixed and machines nasty from bags of mixed chemical flavored things. Yeah, and I have an idea. This is gonna make us a million bucks. I'm gonna make a gun that shoots soda, water and orange juice out of the same thing. And everyone apparently said, it's the seventies who cares about anything. Let's go this way for the firm bars. They did, true, and it was the sexual revolution. So the ladies that were already going to bars now felt like, Hey, I'm in a bar and I can be like a more aggressive all of a sudden, it's a it's the hip happening times. I'm Diane Keaton. I can That's what they said to themselves. I can look for Mr Goodbar and uh and and and have a drink and go meet a man. Uh. I'd like I'd like to was it was my lady from the seventies impression. I have to see Mr Goodbar looking searching for Mr Goodbar, looking for Mr One. Has nobody ever seen that movie? Oh my god, that was a pity clap. They don't have Diane Keaton in Canada. Have you seen it? I think my threes company references way more well received better, But the point is you could bad drinks in these bars, and it's sort of a dark time for the craft of bartending. Like the Bahama Mama, the Kama Kazi um, the sides. Yeah, the Harvey Wallbanger, which apparently was so popular it had its own mascot. It was like, uh, basically a drunken version of Ziggy just wandering around and I guess like you would get a sticker or something if you ordered a Harvey Wallbanger. This is the level of thought people were putting into drinks. If you just sell the drink, you give a sticker out, then that's that's not a place you want to be in. Especially Ziggy with like exces for eyes. Pretty much changed my mind. I think have like one of those inclines coming off of them is kind of nice. I'll get you one for Christmas. They have the money bay. So this is the way things were going for a while, uh, until this very faithful meeting between this guy named Dale de Groff and a dude who owned a restaurant and he wanted to Grof to set up a bar for him. And he said, you know what, I don't want this usual firm bar crud. This is awful, this New York City, Like, we gotta do this, right, Yeah, let's let's get back to basics. And he tossed Dale de Groff a book, a very important book. What book, the Bomby Box Companion from eighteen sixty two. Everything came full circle. Yeah, and Dale de Groff was like, this is amazing. We can bring craftsmanship back into bartending. Unlet's use real ingredients. Let's get rid of these stupid swirly mixing machines and these bags of chemical fruit flavored things, and let's use real fruit, because there is such a thing as real fruit, and we should put it in drinks again, like in the nineteenth century, right, And that's what they did, and the bar was saved. So when you go to like the Cascade Room or the Diamond or I don't know if you guys have been to Boulevard, I know it's like pretty new. But if you finally do go and you enjoy a cocktail there, we did our search, uh, and I hope that was dead on because we I really put us out there just then. But if you go to a place where there's a decent cocktail and somebody's really putting thought into it, you can thank this Dale Degrof guy for bringing it all back, but really you should thank Jerry Thomas to tell you the truth. Now, do you understand why he's my hero? See? They love Jerry Thomas. But let's talk a little more about him. Right. So, like at the bars is, they're evolving and bartenders are evolving. They're going from diamond studded to you know, just normal um. Cocktails are evolving too. Like early on, basically everybody made their own booze and they had it in a jug with three X is on it and they just turned it up and that was like their cocktail. It's how they drank. Yeah, like chuck yeah, based turned the three X jug out. Um. And then when when Jerry Thomas came on the scenes, like we can do better than this. There's some cool ingredients that I want to kind of mess with and create new stuff. So originally there were punches, which is a huge bowl of hot booze that everybody drank from the bumbo that the planners swilled. Right. Then there was a toddy, which apparently from what I can gather, it is just like a single serving hot punch, right, And then there were slings and slings were the ones that had the most promised. Those became what we understand now as cocktails. They were basically booze um, a little bit of water, a little bit of sugar and then maybe some fruit juice. And Jerry Thomas looks at the sling and he goes, I can do something with this, and he creates what's called the Baroque Age of cocktails, where there's just like this great experimentation going on. Nobody knows what the hell anybody else is doing, but everybody's trying new stuff and um. All of these The foundation for what we know now as cocktails came out of Thera. Yeah, and the first cocktail was mentioned in print the word in eighteen o three in Amherst, New Hampshire, with the slogan it's excellent for the head because it was a morning drink. It was you were supposed to drink a cocktail. That's where it comes from, the rooster cocktail, that's where the word comes from. And if you drank too much of the night before, you would get up in the morning and make your little fizzy cocktail drink with bitters, and it was it's like the hair of the dog that with some of us know and love. You would drink your cocktail, get punched in the face by your wife, pick up your acts, and go back out there and work another day. That's what they used to do. Jerry Thomas said, you know what, I love the morning cocktail as much as anybody else. But why can't we keep drinking throughout the day? Let me see if I can mess with this. I save alcoholism for the morning. So through this Baroque era of drink making, it was very very nuanced, like you would have like a sour, and a sour was just booze citrus and a little bit of sweetener usually maybe be curius how or something like that, and then you would change that dramatically by adding soda, and then all of a sudden you had a fizz or if you wanted to use um booze a little bit of grenadine I think, or was it curius how sweetener and um brandy or something, you would have a daisy. And then in Mexico they added tequila to the daisy, and in um Spanish daisy is margarita, So that's where the margarita came from. Around this time, I got some margarita fans out there. Huh So Jerry Thomas was very influential, but he was Uh, if you ever pick up a copy of the Bombay Companion and try and read this thing, it's it doesn't translate that crate to today's um proportions, Like what is a glug like literally like three glugs of this and a pinch of that, and uh, well, I guess pinches easy enough, but well no, I still don't understand pinch. I mean, yeah, it makes sense, but what if you're like, that's that's a lot more than it's a good point. So it took like cocktail historians, uh to to kind of read the thing and bring it into the modern era because back then, sugar came in a big loaf, and sugar wasn't like refined like it is today, and ice, you know, was had a big deal chip it away exactly how you wanted to, And so it took cocktail historians to really kind of translate all this stuff right, and they did, and along the way, Jerry Thomas dies, but he creates his great body of work that's added to over time, and then eventually we come to like the streamlined classic cocktails that we have today. Like the Martini or the Manhattan and all of this was from the work of these like wonderful genius people who are like fighting on the front lines against the temperance movement and making life better for every hero heroes, real heroes, you know, shirking out of like the Civil War and all that stuff, just doing God's work basically. And the Martini. We're gonna talk about some of these classic cocktails and martini. Uh if anyone here drinks martinis, it's always any Martini things. I love Martini, says the guy with the PBR, and it's hand some Martinis right now. I'm just gonna put these back in my helmet and drink them from my stall. So the Martini, if you've ever had a Martini, it's very dependent on the individual on how exactly you like it. Everyone says that that they like make the perfect martini, but the ratio for removed the gin and uh no, no no, I make the perfect Martini Si. Everyone thinks that make how do you make it? Okay? I use um two to three ounces? Okay, I used three o three like Scotch over three three ounces of gin and half an ounce of uh stir itt. Some crushed ice because it gets cold or faster. It's way better strain it. Um. Sometimes, if you want to get a little crazy and you want to go original, the Martini is actually supposed to have orange bitters in it. A couple of dashes of orange bitters. Yeah, you say what, and it seems weird, but you don't taste the orange. It just does something different to it. And then a couple of all of us, all right, Martin, all of juice, I drinklin journey. Do you do you really drink your sturdy? Oh yeah, I like it. It's salty. I don't know. Is that wrong? No? No, no, that's the thing, Chuck, that's the key. There's you enjoy it. There's no wrong. Absolutely. But the origins of the Martini are equally contentious because everyone thinks they invented it. There was a drink in Martinez, California invented the Martini. There was a place in California called Martinez, and they in Martinez, they made a drink called the Martinez and they claimed that the Martini came out of the Martinez, that they are the inventors, but they're just one of several. Right, there's another one that um said, it's just named after Martini and Rossi, the ver with makers. Does anyone else make vermouth? Oh? Yeah, there's tons of other women. Why is that the only one I ever see anywhere? I guess marketing. Okay, man, it's the worst kind of vermouth too, Oh is it really? Yeah, like every other vermouth on the planet is better than Martini and Rossy. And that's the one that everybody knows is Martini and Rossy. I feel like a heel. No, no, you're fine, Okay, you're fine if you enjoy Martini and Rossy, patronize me. I'm getting you back for that one, dude. The West Coast, Yes, we're on the West Coast drinking. What about the dacri? Yeah? The dacari was invented in Cuba by an American who was there working and mines and was bored and uh went to a bar and said, you know what, don't you take some rum and some lime and some sugar and mix that all up and let's make a drink. Uh, and let's call it a dacori. And that's how the decor was born. Yeah. And then the first you know, but making the rosen you take out of the freezer and put into a blender and put like a fifth of romans get wasted. Um, that's the firm bar version. And your wife punches in. You get your acts and you gotta work. You can't work in on a blender full of dacori, believe me. The Tom Collins has an interesting history. Um, kind of dorky now, but in New York in the eighteen hundreds, it was a big fun joke to tell everyone that this guy at Tom Collins has been talking about you. Yeah, because apparently, like just going to a bar to drink wasn't amusing enough, Like they had to jazz it up with hoaxes. You know, they didn't have ziggy stickers at the time, so there was no Tom Collins. Of course it was just a big hoax, but apparently, and it was a big laugh back then to tell people that. So bartenders got the idea like, hey, these people come around asking where it's just Tom Collins. I gotta have a word with him. So let's make a drink called the Tom Collins. So when they come in and ask for it, to serve it to him, and they have to give us money, easy sail, easy peasy every time. What about um, the Mohito's anybody here like a mohito. I like a mohito too. It's good like a mohito. It turns out the mohito might be the oldest cocktail in the entire world. Yeah, it's what mint little sweetener. Right, that's a different drink. Actually it's a mint soda water, some sweetener and uh. Rum. But originally the reason they put all this stuff because these are pirates drinking this in the sixteenth century. Um. And the reason they put all this stuff in was because the stuff they were drinking was just kind of like a proto rum called taffia or agua gardie nice. Um. It tasted so bad that you had to put all this other stuff into it. Um. And so eventually they introduced copper stills to Cuba and started making like really good rum there. But they were like, no, I still like the it and this sugar. Yeah, this is a really delicious drink. So that's the mohito drink. Here in Canada, you have a drink called the Caesar, another popular morning drink, and uh man, they love the Caesar here a Canada. I know we had eight this morning. I have been making those for years, unknowingly calling them bloody Mary's the whole time I did. My friend taught me a recipe. He taught me a recipe to had clomato in it, and it was delicious, and so I was like, well, this is my bloody mary. It's with clomato. I did not know it was had a different name. It's I'm gonna call it a Caesar from now on because it is delicious. It's pretty good, and I really it's it's way better with the clomato to me than just regular tomato drink. It's it's great despite its origins. Apparently, the guy I think his name is Walter Chell, Yeah, from the Cold to re in Um. He went to Venice and tried a spaghetti dish. It was like, I want to drink that tastes like that, and he came up with the Caesar, which you guys love, so you love spaghetti in the glass? A clam dish basically, yeah, what would be really good in this drink? Clams clamns. Yeah, it is a good drink. We just um, and then of course we figure you guys are probably beat us to death with your shoes if we didn't conclude this podcast with a lengthy, lengthy discussion on Canadian whiskey, which you call rye, which we're big fans of actually, and in in Toronto for the first show that we did, um, we said we're going to talk about Canadian whiskey, and everybody went ry and we thought everybody's going why and we we just like looked at each other, like, oh, we just lost the crowd. This is not good. Somebody would I thought they would love this. Yeah. Uh. It turns out we finally everybody calmed down. One person basically raised their hand and and addressed you guys for us and said, everyone's saying rye. We call it ry here, and we're like, okay, so just disregard the last like forty five seconds of panic that you saw us go through. So we understand how you guys call it rye, but we call it Canadian whiskey. The first distillery here in Canada was open in Quebec City you may have heard of in seventeen sixty nine. That was number one, and then by the eighteen forties there were over two hundred distilleries, which is not too bad. You guys love making your whiskey because you had people from Europe in Scotland and Ireland coming over and saying, we know how to make this stuff. We know how to spell it without the e like the rest of those dummies. And that's why you spell whiskey without the e was because of those immigrants. And uh, a man named John Molson is credited. It's starting the first distillery in Canada, whiskey distillery. And and you're rye is very similar to our Bourbon, except the process is different. Like both of them have corn, a lot of corn in them, a lot of malti barley, and then a little bit of rye. The differences in Bourbon County, Kentucky where they have the soberest elections in the country. Um, ironically, ironically, Uh, they take the the corn and the rye and the barley and they ferment and distill it and age it together. You guys take your barley and your corn and your rye and you make liquor out of them, and then you bring them together at the end, which is why rye is a blended whiskey like Scotch. Actually, yeah, apparently the rye part of it is the smallest grain, the smallest amount of grain that they use. But it provides the most flavors. So I guess that's why you call it right and so um, during the Civil War, our our civil war, when our our country was torn asunder, you guys were totally fine. Um, we were busy fighting. We weren't our forefathers were. Um, the Clarks were killing the Bryant's. Yeah, I feel really bad. It's all good. So during the Civil War, during the Civil War, our our distilleries shut down, like, we're like, we have other things to focus on, um, but we still need booze. So Canada said, we got plenty of it here, you guys go. And after the Civil War, Um, when our distilleries went back online, there was an enormous amount of competition still because everybody loved you're rye. You know, we're like, I just got my leg amputated, give me some more of that stuff. And you guys were more than happy to oblige, so much so that the American distillers were like, Congress, we need you to step in and do something about this. And Congress did They said any No, it's true, they said, any any booze that's manufactured outside of the United States has to have his country of origin on the label. So in eighteen ninety a very very popular whiskey from Canada called Club Whiskey became Canadian Club. I'm still around today because of a law, because of us, because of our Congress. Thank you, that's right. And uh, Canadian Club remained super popular still to this day. And in the nineteen sixties. One of the reasons. One of their cool little advertising tricks was that had this cool campaign called hide a Case n sixty seven. They said, Hey, you know what we'll do. Well, let's appeal to the rich drunks of the world and let's hide a case of whiskey in some remote area and leave clues and magazines. And the rich drunk said that this is fantastic something to do with my time. I've been wanting a free case of Canadian Club for a long time. I want to spend fifty dollars finding that street case. So they hit them in places like Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, the Great Barrier, reef Uh, Angel Falls, Venezuela, and um they hit I think the last one in nine the last one in nineteen eighty. They hit in Washington, d C. Yeah, From nineteen sixty five to nineteen eighty they hit twenty five cases and it didn't go quite according to plan um. I think the first case that they hit at Kilimanjaro was found by accident like ten years later. He's like a guy just tripped over again. He's like, oh, case the Canadian Club is here, some rases, I guess it's mine. I'm taking good fortune, so U. And then the last one, by nineteen eighty, they kind of given up on the whole thing. It was in Washington, d C. And I think they let the people who found it watched them just set it down and back away, and they just walked up. They're like, hi to case, catch the fever. But the cool thing is is there's a bunch of them out there that have never been found, still hidden. So there any rich drunks out there with some with the passport and some spare time. There's some whiskey that you could buy at the store, or you could just spend a lot of money and go out and try and find it. Right, And that's all we found out about Canadian whiskey. You got anything else, man, I'm just glad that people can see your jazz hands lives because we're doing a lot. He does that in the studio for me, and I'm just like, I wasn't even thinking about that. Did you bring a listener mail? Uh? No, sir, No, Okay, we'll have to double one in later. Sorry. Someone prepared one to hand to like one of the paper airplane of the listener mail. They can find people throw stuff up here. Um, so I guess we'll wrap it up. There's more story. Everybody treats us in store. Um, if you want to know more about bars, you can type that word into the search part how stuff Works. But UM, I don't think it's gonna bring anything up.
