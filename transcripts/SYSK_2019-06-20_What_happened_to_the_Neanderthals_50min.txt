Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry over there, and um, this is stuff you should know, Stuff you should Nizzo. I'm excited about this one. This just feels like classic Josh and Chuck. I think so too. Took Took's gonna make an appearance. Took Took Mike make Sweet Love, which is always fun. And watching Took, yeah, we like to watch. He's surprisingly tender, he is. I'm sorry all the third graders are actually, more to the point, the third grade teachers who are standing there right now at the head of class, they're like, oh, what happened to the Neanderthal's perfect for the classroom? Right? So yeah, this is very uh. I thought this is very cool. I love this. But we've talked a little bit about Neanderthal's in the past and Homo sapiens and uh, Dennis Snovin's and that's right, right, there's an extra end in there. I think Dennis Stovan's. Dennis Snoven sounds like a dude, like he manages the ice cream factory, right, Snovin, Dennis Snovin, Uh, this is good stuff, though, So let's let's treat everyone so all right, we'll do our best. Put the pressure on. So Neander neander tals it really so? Then correct pronunciation is tall by the way. Yeah, I had a teacher point that out, remember, very specifically in the in the ninth grade. But when you're being correct, you're actually speaking in Old German, not even modern German. So it's really just a question of how you want to say it. Either one's acceptable, no, I mean the pronunciation would still be that in modern German. Neander tal Yeah, okay, because I saw it spelled t a L two. Oh really yeah, let's get rid of that age. Okay. I kind of like it. I like how it looks, but I think it's up to the individuals. Say taller thal okay, but the correct way is neander tal right, okay, and Neander talls. I'm probably gonna just switch back and forth. That's okay with everybody, not to make a big deal out of it or anything, but um, neander talls uh or thals, depending on who you are. They were a species of human beings of humans like if you think about it, Chuck, you, Jerry me, everybody out there. Sometimes yeah, same species, one species of human, that's it. Like you just don't really kind of think about that. But if you dial back a little bit, if we got on the way back machine and went back just like forty thousand years, there'll be at least one other species of human running around on Earth, and they would be the Neanderthals. Yes, so we didn't even know that there was another such thing as another human species until the eighteen fifties because there was a forty thousand year gap separating us. And then that's right, So the very first fossils of a Neanderthal was found in eighteen twenty nine in Belgium and then again in Gibraltar in eight But they kind of were just like, oh cool, look at these old bones. Wasn't a big deal. What's how easy they snap on my knee? Right? They didn't know what they were, no, And then in nineteen fifty six in Germany, something pretty significant happened. Uh, they found some pretty substantial fossils. I think a whole skeleton actually, yeah, well they definitely found a whole skull um. This was in four or five ft of clay at in a limestone quarry cave and a site called felt so Glad. And this is in the Neander Valley near Dusseldorf. And this is where it all comes around. If you hear the word Neanderthal or a tall um t h a l and old German means valley. And so the scientific name Homo neander tollensus means humans from the Neander Valley. Yes, because it means that's where the first one that we realized, Um, wait a minute, this is This isn't a cave bear. This isn't like some some dead person. This is a different species of human. Yeah. They saw that the what we now know is classic Neanderthal oval shape. That that big thick, low receding forehead and brow, very thick bones. This uh, that was brought to the query foreman and he said it's a cave bear. I guess you came over from Alabama. But he said, but I do know a teacher and a guy who's really into fossils. His name is Johann Karl full Rot. And here you can have these bones. He got them, did some impressions, what uh, did some castings of these and sent though those to Hermann uh Schaffhausen, a professor. I don't know German is so funny. I don't either, but coming out of your mouth, it's like it's just hilarious. After all these years. He's a professor, was a professor of anatomy at the University of Bonn. And they both were like, hey, this is significant because this ain't no human. Uh no homo sapien. But it's a human, right, we think, right, it's some other kind of human, some other kind of hominid that we just didn't understand before. So they presented their fightings in the world. He said, look at this. Everybody, get a load of this. And there was an immediate problem with Neanderthals there there's so this is eighteen fifty eighteen fifty seven when they prevented presented their fightings. And that was before on the origin of the species. So before Darwin, it was like God created all this, God created you, God created the panther, God created the monkeys separately, like all this stuff was all separate. And then Darwin came along and said, no, all this stuff is actually related. And if you trace everything far enough back, you're gonna find the last common ancestor between two things that don't look anything alike um, including humans and apes. And so this was before that, so it didn't fit into the Christian creation story. But then even after Darwin came along, it just so happened that Neanderthals were discovered and analyzed and and it was realized that they were in different species of human at a time when biological anthropology was around, yeah, phrenology and the you know, we've talked about it on the show a little bit, the very sort of racist practice of um categorizing humans in their inferiority of races by the shapes of their skull. Right, look at this skull, um, well there it's not not basically Western and European shaped. We think it has some weird ridge. Um, so they're an inferior race. They extended all that onto Neanderthals because if you think, you know, if you're if you're comparing like human Homo sapiens skulls to one another and somehow finding inferiority or superiority, and that in the shapes of those when you compare a Neanderthal skull to a human skull, clearly that human skull is much more refined and developed. Neanderthals must have been these dim witted brutes the caveman. Like, the whole reason we think of the caveman and Neanderthals is big dummies and and oaths. It is because they were discovered during a time of racist science. Yeah, and that was the view that was held, and it's still held by some people who don't know better. This is why we're doing that, you know, one reason why we're doing this episode. But it was held for a couple of hundred years. But in the recent decades things have changed. Our picture of the Neanderthal has changed because of science and research, and we now know that, uh, well a lot of cool things. I don't want to spoil it yet, Okay, Yeah, I was wondering if that was too much of the beans getting out. I think, so let's tease that out. That's fine with me. So, uh, we'll just sit here quietly for a second as we go past this. Okay, all right, we ready, yeah, alright, So the current story, like the simple version of the current story is the Neanderthal and the I mean, should we just say the modern human or Homo sap That's how I was like, how could because they're both humans, yeah, but they're just two different species of human sapience tal and sapiens. All right. So they separated between a half a million and about six hundred and fifty thousand years ago, and they both diverge from a common branch um H. Heidel their genesis rgensis. I think the g is hard. I'm pretty sure that's right. H. Heidelbergensis. Yeah, all right, that sounds right. Yeah. And this was in Africa, right, that's where the divergence happened. That's right. Um. Then, so either the division, the divergence happened in Africa or some Heidelbergensis state in Africa, and some spread out of Africa to yeah, into the Old World in Asia. And over time, because of the separation, these groups of humans started branching out and developing into distinct species. One of the species, the first one to develop into a distinct species from this branch, was Neanderthals, and by at least four hundred thousand years ago, there were Neanderthals running around like distinct species of humans called Neanderthals. Yeah, and they were developing independently because they were very far from each other, and they didn't for a very long time, did not have very much, if any, contact with one another. Yeah. Remember we did an episode on speciation where like brown bears and polar bears used to be the same bear, but the polar bear started drifting further and further north, and they actually adapted to a different climate, different habitat, so much so that they became a different species. That's the exact same thing that we're talking at. Heidelberg ansis drifted into two different parts of Africa and Europe, and the climate in the habitat was different enough that it split into two different species. Yeah. So what you've got in Eurasia is a range from like Portugal and whales in the west over to like Siberia. This is for Neanderthals, right, Yeah, in the east. So that was their range in general, and all the way down to the Middle East. Yeah, it was a huge range, very big range. Um the biggest. Uh. They were shorter than sapiens that we're still in Africa. They were kind of stockier, they had bigger brains, they were by most accounts, stronger, more muscular, had wider hips and shoulders, sturdier bones, very sturdy, just stocky, robust things you would not want to mess with the Neanderthal No, and they were very adaptable. They they lived in very cold environments. Uh, they lived in very sort of warm, temperate environments. So it depends on the time. This is what they think. They think that that range that was so huge for the Neanderthals, there wasn't necessarily Neanderthals living in all parts of that range at the same time for four hundred thousand years or three fifty thousand years. They think that over time, some Neanderthal populations died and others came along and replaced them, and then some of them moved down here and some of them were over here. That they may have lived in different parts of the world at the same time, but not necessarily their entire range all at once. For the whole three fifty thousand years. They moved a lot, and nor did they move all together as whole populations. It was a lot of local extinctions and recolonizations going on, right think exactly. So it's almost like if you could look at the map of eur Asia on a time lapse over three fifty thousand years that Neanderthals were around in the area, you would just kind of see these little populations kind of growing and popping and dissolving and then picking up again. And these are actually new groups going into areas becoming like dying out for one reason or another. And then a thousand or ten thousand years later, there's another group that says, oh, this is a great spot and showing up kind of like our real Atlantis episode. Remember there's like like twelve feet of like fifty different settlements over thousands and thousands of years because they're just like, this is a great place to settle, but each one had no idea that the last one was there. Same thing with the Neanderthal range. So the Neanderthals are doing their thing all over your Asia. Meanwhile back in Africa and East Africa, you've got the Sapien doing their thing. And then they start to radiate out a little bits, the Sapiens and then get obviously the Middle East would be a pretty logical next place to go from Africa, and they happened upon the Neanderthal and they're like wow, we wow, who are you? And then they were all of a sudden sharing space together, right starting about a hundred thousand years ago in the Middle East, in the Middle East, and then in Europe. They shared space for two hundred to five hundred generations. Yeah, they just like the Neanderthals spread out. The sapiens basically followed the same path. But there were already people there. It was Neanderthals and um. Yeah, two hundred generations, generations between four thousand and ten thousand years. Very long time to share space. It really is like that many generations that that of just living in the same place. The thing is is over the lifespan of the Neanderthals, three fifty thousand years, four thousand years is nothing. It's the blink of an eye. And around the time about so say humans or sapiens showed up in Europe about forty two two thousand years ago, about forty thou years ago something give or take a few thousand years, Neanderthals just vanished. Did they melt? We don't remember that old theory. That's all right, they've melted. It was like nine years ago. That was so uh. I think it's a good place for a break. Yeah, we'll talk about what happened right after this. Well, now we're on the road, driving in your truck. Want to learn a thing or two from Josh Damn chuck stuff you should know, all right, m alright, So, uh, appearance of of sapiens in Europe before this um disappearance of Neanderthals. For a very long time, everyone basically just had one of two you're easy, either that sapiens killed them off or that they were just so smart that they out competed them for resources and they went away. And that was It's known as the replacement model or the recent African origin model, right, and people were all on that train. Some people still very much are. Oh yeah, in academia, not just not just you know, the general public. I say, boo to that. I agree, And it seems like there are people who are kind of chipping away at that. But I believe the replacement model is the dominant model for what happened to the Neanderthals. It basically says, humans, Homo sapiens came along and our brains are so much smarter. We were capable of things that Neanderthals couldn't even dream of, um, things like culture and art and all sorts of men right, um language probably um that the Neanderthals just didn't stand a chance. Once the sapience showed up. It was like progresses here, go ahead and die and either directly by killing them via warfare or like you said, just out competing them. That was it for the Neanderthals. And the timing is definitely well sure suspect, you know, like and I think that's what a lot of people have clamped onto is humans show up a couple of thousand years, Neanderthals are gone. Yeah, it makes sense, um on the surface. But in two thousand and ten there was some pretty startling discovery. Um, they fully sequenced Neanderthal genome, which is amazing, super amazing, and we found out wait a minute, us sapiens, some of us have Neanderthal DNA in our bodies. Are Neanderthals ourselves? Yeah about depending on where you're from in your ethnic background, but if you're European or Asian, you have pretty good likelihood of being one to four percent in Neanderthal as far as your DNA goes. UM. In Sub Saharan Africa, there's not any obviously, because that's where the sapiens were all, uh, you know, hanging out and doing their thing right. They hadn't migrated out and intermixed with the with the Neanderthals. So you know what that means. That means that time period where they were all sharing space, they're also sharing space. There was like a lot of you know what I'm saying, they were making love. Oh that ye took took would make love and create little baby tooktoks. We have to say for just to keep your crownded, we're not exactly sure what kind of uh circumstances that making love took. No, you're right, it could have been mistaken identity. Um. And obviously the brutal scenario, which is probably the most likely, is that they came in by force and that was like raping and pillaging going up. But the thing is, we don't know that that's necessarily likely. You know, I don't know. We honestly have such a little understandings to Neanderthal We have no idea they might have been hippies, But we got to throw that out there, uh as one of the obvious possibilities. Yeah, as much as you want to just be like, oh, that's so awesome that Neanderthals were there, the humans showed up and rather than humans killing off Neanderthals, get out of here, you old archaic humans, they said, let's get it on well, not only let's get on, let's let's let's share resources, let's teach each other things, let's explore life together, and let's didn't go away. They just got absorbed and because there were far more sapiens, uh, their traits just you know, sort of got weeded out over the years for the most part. So this is the rival to that replacement model that's the dominant model. This is called the multi regional evolution model, and it says basically what you just said, that Neanderthals and humans did it so much that the hybrid human Neanderthals that were um that were born as offspring um, they they mated with other Neanderthals or other humans. But because there were more sapiens I'm sorry, more sapiens than there were Neanderthals, the likelihood was that a hybrid would be much more likely to mate with a sapient and then that high bread would be even more watered down neandertal And then over time, because of and Neanderthals didn't die off, they didn't get chased out, they just became part of that larger human genome. So there's another theory too that's interesting, or another interpretation I guess it's not a theory. And this has to do with climate change. Um. They did a study into and well this year actually two thousand nineteen in France, and they discovered that all you need over the course of about ten thousand years is about a two point seven decrease in fertility rates UM to go bye bye. Ten tho years for a decrease in UM first time young Neanderthal mothers that population, and they said cut that in half basically are close to it. Within four thousand years, you would need only an eight percent decrease in fertility and that same group. So it's very uh, it makes a lot of sense that with a little bit of climate change and a little bit of scarcity and just uh, it didn't have to be anything drastic. But over that amount of time, if you don't have any as many calories going into your body in your first time under twenty year old uh Neanderthal mother, you're not going to be successful and you're not gonna be as fertile. And then over time that just means you you kind of very quietly and slowly go away. Yeah, I got this. I think I found this article from Live Science and in it they they say, by the way, um, if the human replacement rate dropped to one point three babies per mother, we'd be gone in three years. So so just a very slight drop among neandertals could have accounted for that four thousand to ten thousand year process of just suddenly disappearing. And again in this this interpretation, humans didn't do anything. We didn't war with them, we didn't outcompete them, we we didn't do anything. It was just something happened to the environment and it was just harder to be fertile. And it wasn't all at once. Maybe it might have been staggered in different parts of the world exactly over over four thousand to ten thousand years. And the reason it wasn't that Neanderthals couldn't compete, that they couldn't survive um, whereas humans could. Because Neanderthals, again, their lifespan was three hundred fifty thousand years. Modern humans have only been around for fifty to a hundred thousand years, maybe two at the outside. So Neanderhal's had been around for a very long time, had been very good at adapting to a changing climate basically the whole time that they were around, so It's not like they couldn't compete or couldn't adapt and humans could. What they think is that they were just way more humans, and so our numbers probably dropped at the same rate that Neanderthal numbers did. There was just more of us to survive and carry on after things got better. Yeah, and in more varied ranges in parts of the world too. That all kind of makes sense to me. Yeah, I suppose it could be. Uh, both of those, climate change and lovemaking right very easily. Yeah, they definitely go hand in hand. Like should we take another break? All right, We'll take another break and talk about what we now the sort of current understanding of the picture of what the Neanderthal was. Right after this, Well, now we're on the road driving in your truck. Want to learn a thing or two from Josh can Chuck. It's stuff you should know. All right. By the way, have you seen or heard of that movie William? Uh, it was out in April, did not do well, was not reviewed well. But it is basically a sort of mad scientist. Not a mad scientist, but a scientist with a mad idea. Uh, there's a human neandertal born. They get the d n A impregnate a modern sapient woman and she has a a Neandertal boy, William, and he goes to high school. I did not see that. I had no idea about that movie. Yeah, just check out the trailer. Oh, I don't haven't seen it. It's not supposed to be very good, and it did not look very good. But it was very much like, you know, I just want to fit in, and he's you know, he's in Neandertal. He's got the regular haircut, in the vans and the jeans and the T shirt. He's got the big forehead and the thick It sounds a lot, it does, and it looks like it could be a joke, but it's real. Was there that I feel good in the middle of the trailer or that scene where like like a teen woolf or something where he's really good at sports or something. Yeah, yeah, man, William, Yeah, there's a weekend for you. I'm not gonna watch it, but I just thought it'd be it'd be worth mentioning before the emails come in. So, uh, the image. We were on a quest. I think um and sciences on a quest to sort of rehabilitate That's why you mentioned that, but to rehabilitate the image of the Neanderthal is this hunched over brute. Part of the problem is, uh they sort of based in an entire species on this one hunched over uh dude skeleton skeleton, and they're like, look at them that they're all hunched over oaths. And now they're like, oh, actually that individual may have had a digener to bone disease. And what we now think is they just walked around like we do and probably looked a lot like we do. Yeah. Um. They think that from you, like, sequencing the Neanderthal genome, they think that at least some of them had red hair and light colored skin, which, by the way, by interbreeding UM with neandertals recent arrivals from Africa, their hybrid offspring would have been conferred with UM thicker, straighter hair, a smaller compact frame, all sorts of stuff that you would need UM in this colder climate of eur Asia from having just come up from Africa over the last few generations. So there was good stuff, there was also bad. So they think some of the disease that we suffer from uh IS is actually related to neandertal DNA. That doesn't have a context or a point or a function like it used to, and that that now it's actually producing disease in us. Yeah, like the same d NA. Like they could have had the same things that we associate with diabetes and crones, but they would have bedn't affect them like it does us. Yeah, there's a lifestyle and everything that how we diverged precisely really interesting, I think is actually that's the alternative explanation for the hygiene hypothesis. I did these these both sort of linked in some ways right there. So behaviorally, it's, uh, we're again we're trying to get away from this idea of cavemen, uh and things that we thought were strictly sapient. Over the years, it turns out that Neanderthals were actually good at like making tools. Uh. And this really interesting technique, uh, the Leva leva loire technique, which is basically, I am in the area where I have the resources to make all the tools, but we gotta pack up and leave, and we don't know if we're gonna have this stuff there. Yeah, there's some dinosaurs after us. Yeah, so like the very like raw resource, like let's say it's just a certain type of stone. So we're gonna pre shape all these things into it's sort of a rudimentary uh, a rudimentary tool that we can later make into a hammer or a chisel, like, depending on what we need. But we're kind of sort of pre shape them here, pack them up, and take them all with us, so we'll have this little factory that we can set up anywhere we want what we need. Yeah, that's smart, it is, and it's a technological innovation that is definitely attributed to the Neanderthals, Like they came up with um and tool making, Like we knew that older archaic humans were good with tools going back probably a million or so years. Chimps use tools, they use termite sticks. So people are saying, like great, Like the Neanderthals like created some sort of like new technology, some new tool culture. Um, who cares. It still doesn't make them smart. But there's other stuff we found out about Neanderthals that we started that have really kind of changed our view of them because they're doing things or they we found out they're capable of things that that they are supposed to. Those are the things that make humans humans, Like Neanderthals aren't supposed to have been doing this. But the more evidence we're getting, the with the fresher eyes were looking at existing evidence, it's starting to look like they were behaviorally modern like humans, or there's a really good chance that they were Yeah like the sapes. Uh, they could they could spark fire, so the old notion like quest for fire, that they just had to sit around and wait for lightning to strike a bush is not true. They use that fire to cook food, they think, they think, which is a big deal. It's open new interpretation stuff. Um what else they know from studying the injuries on the animals that they hunted, That they were very intelligent hunters and they killed big, big animals at close range, which meant that they were skilled, that they understood risk, that they were brave, and that they will get into communication more. But you've got to be communicating to to do something like that. Yeah, because they would hunt in packs, but they would do it in close range. The hunt in packs and always at the velociraptor. Oh, I think so Jurassic Park by uh the while, they threw me off. Sorry, do you think I'd be expecting in this episode? Though? You know it wasn't they do hunting packs though it was I was just appropriating that line. But what was it? Oh man, they do travel in they do pack lightly, Yeah, that was it? Okay, so um, the fact that these guys would take on reindeer and bison and mammoths at close range with like spears and javelins and like, you know, some some hand to hand combat type stuff has really kind of undermined that that replacement model idea that humans came in and just killed off all the Neanderthals because they just stood no chance. They right, Neanderthals were tough, tough mos. Yes, most um one of the big ones here. And this is where it gets super interesting, I think to me is the use of symbols. That is something that we thought was very much sapien, very sapey. Right, if if they can, if they we can show that Neanderthals understood symbols and had that kind of higher thought that would make them behaviorally equivalent to humans. And we're talking like any sapiens. We're talking anything from making a like a necklace out of beads to wear like an adornments, to using like pigments on the face like the precursor to make up and stuff like that. Yeah, humans have been shown to UM to have been doing that at least for the last eighty thousand years. And I don't know why I can't get that um sapes have been doing that. Uh, there's the earliest evidences at two sites in Ethiopia, and this is they think it was like for you know, identity or jewelry or something like that, but it is like, that's not something you just do like this is there's a there's not necessarily a practical function to it, and it's a form of art. And there's ambiguous evidence that Neanderthals did this too, that there was body adornment, that there was that they would color themselves and pigments, put on makeup basically right, So here's the thing question. So that would suggest that Okay, if Neanderthal's do that and humans did that too, then that makes Neanderthal's equivalent to humans behaviorally. But the people who are big time into the replacement model that Neanderthals were actually kind of stupid and humans are the pinnacle and the first example of higher intelligence. UM, they say, well, if you really kind of date some of this stuff that the Neanderthal has made it's probably around the time that humans showed up, and it's really just Neanderthal's copying what they saw humans doing. But there's no symbol symbolism to it, and that like they could copy a shell as an ornament, but there they didn't have any meaning. Yeah, which is a really sort of a snotty approach. I think so too. Well, they might have done it, but they were just copying, no copying. Remember that kid, you know the kids doing now he or she is running the company? Is that Dennis Snoven ice cream and manager ice crea factory manager. So, uh, cave art. Let's talk about cave art because this is this is the one thing that um to make art is the one thing that traditionally have always separated sapes from everyone else. Right, Like, if everybody's saying, okay, even if Neanderthals came up with body adornments, that's not art. We're gonna the bar. This is what the poop pooers say, that doesn't really qualify as art. Cave art is where it's at. If you could show me Neanderthals that created cave art, I will agree that they are behaviorally equivalent to modern humans of their era. Yeah, and they found cave art modern sapiens. Man, they found cave art at the same time that there were Neanderthals around caves it um. Again, it was just like, oh, well that was the Sapes. That wasn't the Neanderthals doing that, right? They think that the Savings came in and made that cave art, right, Like, we need an ambiguous proof at this point. Here's the problem. Radiocarbon dating gets unreliable after forty years, and it requires organic material to date these pigments. Uh, they're using mineral pigments, not organic one. So that was a problem. But and this is kind of mind blowing. In two thousand eighteen, they discovered or I guess perfected a dating technique that measures the rate of decay of uranium atoms and calcite deposits. So that's what makes up stalactites and stalagmites. Yeah. So the idea is if you find cave art's sort of like the mosquito caught an amber, it's a time stamp. If you find cave art that's underneath uh some of this deposits that have dripped down over it and encased it, and you can date that. Then you know how old that cave art is? Yeah, because the cave of arts under the caw site. You know how old the cave the caw site is than the cave art has to be at least as old or slightly older than the earliest deposit of cow sit. What's the secret? Well, there was there was a study in two thousand and eighteen that found that some cave art in in a cave in Spain was created sixty four thousand years ago, a full twenty thousand plus years before Homo sapiens showed up in the area, which means that it had to have been Neanderthals that created this cave art. Do you know what the brewer said? That's not really art? What s wwhere to God? Are you serious? He's like some hand stencils and some dots on the wall, that doesn't count. That's the first art ye tracing their hand to make a turkey. They are really holding on for dear life. But it's it's some people are really swimming against this current, like they do not want the idea that humans are not uniquely um uh special. I guess in that sense that people have been thinking that it was humans and these Homo sapiens that have the ability to create art and think symbolically. Um, and it's starting to look like that's not the case. Not only that that not it's not just humans, and that maybe Neanderthals did too. But that's possible that this kind of stuff evolved even further back in that Heidelbergensis are less common ancestor running around seven thousand years ago, may have created art and may have been doing all this other stuff too that makes us uniquely human. Well. Um, another one is music. They have found bones from k bears in southeast Europe that had these holes and they're like, hey, looks like a flute to me, plays like a flute. It sounds like a flute. Um. So it's Jethro tull. Uh. That's so good. I'm so glad that they added flute to their their outfit. Not many groups Martial Tucker band had the flute. And here's a little something for you. I mean, I told the story, but I was in our little local market getting some food about two years ago, remember that, and there was a guy in a band clearly and he was like, play flute for Marshall Tucker. It's like, are you kidding? No, I'm not like, you're one of the two most famous flutists in rock music. Sure, but it wasn't the original guy I found out still plays flute from Marshall Tucker agreed. Just because he didn't write those flute parts doesn't make him any less of a flutist. He could still play. Yeah, so uh Anyway, they the naysayers with the flute are just like, oh no, man, those are just they were bones chomped on by hyena teeth. Yeah, the the flute holes, the finger holes are teeth teeth marks. Yeah, and sure you can play aqualong on it, but that's just because the hyenas and their teeth marks. Right. Um. There's a there's also really good evidence, cumulative evidence. There's one other thing about the cave art that we didn't say. Uh well, that was one thing that they found what looks to be stalactite like purposeful arrangements of stalactites in a cave that's from a hundred and seventy six thousand years sure, right um, But now there are other similar cave art paintings in Spanish caves um are in different places. So they think it was an actual part of Neanderthal culture. There wasn't one particularly imaginative Neanderthal who happened to leave it behind. Yes, and it even said this is art love took took find me on insta at took took Oh if only um So. The The other thing that there's a lot of a massed evidence for is that Neanderthals appeared to have buried they're dead. This is pretty cool. This is enormous because Okay, not only can they think symbolically and like art and creating representations of things that may or may not exist, they can they're thinking about something coming after this. You don't just bury a corpse for many reasons other than um spiritual reasons. I mean, you can to keep, like you know, the wolves away because you're going to camp near the corpse. But if you're a hunter gather, you just move camp and you can leave the person laying out there in the bush by for the wolves to take. It doesn't matter because there's no afterlife. If you bury somebody, it indicates you thinking about something beyond this life, and that is definitely higher level thinking. Yeah, and when we say Barry, we don't mean they just found this body like on the floor of a deep cave, like they dug a hole and placed a body in there, positioned them in a specific way. They found Yeah, different like grave sites basically like cemeteries, bodies buried in the same manner. Uh. And they even found in northern Iraq pollen flower pollen, which clearly suggests that they buried them with flowers. They definitely seems to that's like, that's a funerary, right, unless it was just an accident and they just dropped a bunch of flowers on the way up, which I mean, it's possible, but it seems unlikely. I don't know if I'm being naive, but I really want to believe this. Yeah, well, it's nice, it's refreshing to think about. You know, humans don't have to have for sapiens don't have to have the market corner. We can share the humanity. Yeah, here's another one. Um, if they were just brutes who you know, who didn't have any capacity to understand things or take care of one another. They found individuals, and one in particular that was deaf, likely visually impaired because of a blow to the head from as a ute, probably from a sapien. Maybe ye was missing his right hand and then suffered a disease that reduced his mobility. And they found this person lived into his forties, maybe up to fifty. Yeah, which there's no way person would have survived without a community of people taking care of and making sure that this person survived and ate and got around and moved along with them because they cared for one another and tried to heal one another. Right, Yeah, they took care of their sick. They're injured, they're they're disabled, they're ill um they like, they took they shared resources with them. People who couldn't necessarily contribute still got stuff from the from the community, which suggests this tight knit social group that cared for one another. And then what about language? So this one just knocked my socks off. There are these Dutch researchers who wrote a paper that argued that um, Neanderthal's almost certainly spoke a nuanced language that we would recognize as a modern language um and that not only did Neanderthals speak this speak their own language, probably Heidelbergensis and maybe even further back in our archaic family line spoke language too, and that if that's true, If that's the case, Neanderthals had their own language, and human humans absorbed Neanderthal's both culturally and genetically. It's entirely possible that there are traces of Neanderthal language that still appear in our languages that are spoken around the world today unbeknownst to us. Man, if they could find out those words, isn't that amazing? Yeah, it's pretty cool. I love that. I like all this. I love you Neanderthals, love you Sapien, love you Tuck Tuck and uh. I think I used to just throw tuk tuk around in various ways, but then you developed a taste for watching and make luve that's right. But let me just from this point forward, Took Took is clearly uh deep No, clearly Neanderthal. Ohh. I think I had kind of just threw Took Took's name around as any kind of early man. Yeah, he could have been Captain Caveman. He could have been the Gego cave Man. But he could be William for all I know. You know, I thought about it. I thought about it. The so Took Took is officially Neandertal. Yes, okay, um, the Geico Caveman is actually a really good parable for the struggle between the interpretation of Neanderthals today, like everybody's like it's so easy a caveman could do it, and this guy's playing like squash and driving a Porsche. Yeah. Do you remember that their their short lived TV show. I remember that it existed, but I never saw it. They drove one of them drove a Porsche. Yeah, and now a word from Geico. Uh okay, Well, if you want to know more about Neanderthals, start reading up about it. And there's a pretty amazing exhibit funded by one of the Koch brothers if I'm not mistaken, at the Smithsonian where you can see a real live Neanderthal skeleton. Really pretty beautiful. Um, what's their angle right something? Maybe maybe they're trying to rehabilitate Neandertals for some reason to bring them back is floated workers. And since I just said something about the Koch brothers, time for go ahead administrative Okay, Chuck, as I said, it's time for administrative. Is this like a family guy where you're just gonna do that? All right, We're gonna start this one off. This is when we thank listeners for sending in kindnesses to us and Michelle from Crown Royal once again. The Booze company that just keeps giving. I know, they just keep us in booze.
