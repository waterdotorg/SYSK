Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant with Jerry Rowland. Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do? And this is breaking stuff you should Know, recorded two days before it gets released. We're basically like pod Save America now. Yeah, and uh, I think it's funny that the only reason we are speeding this year was because of laziness, Because I said that an email early is like, guys, if we published this in two or three weeks, we're gonna have to go back and rerecording dates. Yeah, and I don't want to rerecord updates. I don't want to either. We could have also been super duper lazy and released it and not done updates, but then we would just been like slobs. Would have been like Blue Do Brother Blue Do in Animal House right, kind of like we went back and updated the Obamacare episode so many times exactly. I mean, I think about how much work we put into that one. Man. Uh, So, Chuck, we're talking today about North Korea. I've been wanting to do this one for a while. I learned so much. Yeah, one of the things that I learned is that a lot of the bizarre rumors I've always heard about North Korea, a lot of those are actually totally true. Yeah, and I learned that just knowing, just having a basic understanding of its history really just sort of helps frame everything it does very much. So you definitely get a feel for why it is the way it is, just a basic understanding. Yeah, we do. You know, we're definitely not North Korea experts by anything. But what's interesting to me is there are actually people out there who are it's their job to analyze reports that come out of pyeong Yang and um like the way that that Kim Jong un might um wave is using his left hand today, or that actually means this, there's people whose job it is to know that and to be able to say this is probably what they're going to do next. How is he wearing his hair today? Oh, the same easworn't every day of his life. Well, here's a fact for you. The the speaking of his hair, he has a very unique hairstyle for his country. As a matter of fact, he may be the only person in his country with that hairstyle. Yes, because when he came to power, Right after he came to power in two thousand and eleven, the North Korean government, lad of course, by Kim Jong un um, issued a decree that if you're a man, you can have hair that is two inches long, and if you're an older man, three inches long. That's it. If you're a woman, you can have one of fourteen hairstyles. I haven't. Oh yeah, they got the hairstyles for the men and women that are allowed. That's why I that's why I thought like that was just a rumor something. That's one of the things that was confirmed for me. I never oh the poster, although I probably would have been suspicious even after the poster because you know, photoshop and all. But his hair looks like one of the approved hair styles. It's long, well, way longer than a couple of inches. It's hard to tell because he's he's keeps it slick back. Yeah yeah, yeah, I think that his hair is is totally unique in North Korea, at least with length. So when he wakes up in the morning and he's in shaggy dog mode, it's all hanging down in his face. Yeah, it looks like the new bass player from Metallica, who was who Oh, he's like the guy from Metal Metal Apocalypse. Is he the same guy that took over since the what, Sir Jason, same guy? Yeah, but he it's like him, And that does Zach Galifernakis, the guy who played guitar for Rozzy Osbourne. Like the two most metal looking guys in the history of metal. Probably the new bass player from Atallica. Oh yes, dude, it's almost like, you know, they prayed to God to craft a metal bass player. He's in. He's an archetype for sure, but I'm pretty sure he's the guy from Metal A, Metal Apocalypse, Metal Acalypse, you know what I'm talking about. It's like about the metal band from Adult Swim. There's like a cartoon about the Metal Bank. So I'm pretty sure that's him at any rate, North Korea. If if we're gonna have to talk about Dennis Rodman, then we're going to talk about Metallica's bass player. So let's start at the latest as it stands right now. Okay, Like, what's going on now? Do you want to or do you want to with that? That's fine? Okay. So there's been some really surprising developments and a lot of people are very much reserved and saying, do not be distracted by this, do not be fooled. Um. But as it stands, North Korea and South Korea just had a summit, which they've had from time to time, but they had a summit in the demilitarized zone where president the President's Korea and the president of North Korea got together and said, let's make this a de nuclearized peninsula. Let's end this war. By the way, the Korean War has still been going on since nineteen it never ended. Yeah, that's it's been a long truce. Let's end it and let's just reunify. And people are going nuts because this actually seems like there's a possibility of it. And one of the reasons why they think there's possibility is because this is such an about face for the North compared to two weeks ago. Yeah, I mean, all right, listen again. Because there is reason for optimism, there is plenty of reason for skepticism. Uh. And I don't think anyone really knows whether or not to believe North Korea. No, but there are plenty of people who do believe that that you should not believe it, right because it could you know, some people say this could be a a ruse to unify Rhea and UM and get America out of there once and for all, which could be scary. Um. There's people that thinks that, you know, there's recent reports that this this whole notion of shutting down their nuclear test site is um merely symbolic, but for two reasons. A because they've got what they needed and they don't need to test anymore. And be because this geologist in China, did you see that report? He just came out like yesterday saying, I think that this site has has been destroyed. Oh I did see that via earthquake, via setting off nuclear bombs, So like it's not even there anymore anyway, right, they set off a hydrogen bomb and blew their nuclear testing facility up. Yeah, so so, but now it's a bargaining chip on the table exactly. And the reason they can say that is because it is such a closed off area. It's so difficult to surveil that you have to rely on the report of a Chinese geologist and and say, Okay, maybe that's true, maybe it's not. You don't know, because it's a hermit kingdom. Yeah, but there have been a few olive branches in the past few days. Um. I didn't even know this. In two thousand fifteen, Um, North Korea set their clocks off by thirty minutes so they wouldn't have the same time. Yeah, and so uh, North Korea said, you know, we're gonna set these clocks back. We're gonna realign. Uh and they I've also in recent days been dismantling these propaganda loudspeakers at the border where they both sides pump, Like on the south side they pumped K pop and like, hey, this is what it's like to be free, and then on the other side they pump out I don't know, just North Korean propaganda, but they're taking down these loudspeakers. So they're they're little signs that like, I don't know, maybe this is for real. I was looking all over for some some verbatim examples of the propaganda that comes out of the North loud speakers. Should not find it anywhere. Set that to an nice beach, a K pop pit of your own. But yeah, dismantling this is is that's huge. That's a big deal. And the steam militarized and we'll talk more about it, but it is widely considered the most dangerous I think two mile strip of land on the planet um. And the reason why it's so dangerous. So the reason why it's there is, again, as far as Korea is concerned, and especially as far as North Korea is concerned, the Korean War is still ongoing back and I think nine fifty three they signed an armistice a piece, not a peace treaty, a ceasefire, but there hasn't been a peace treaty, so the war is still going on, which is clue number one that I didn't realize. But that's clue number one to the situation over there. Once you understand that, you start to understand, oh, they've been in a warlike stance this whole time, because they consider themselves to have been at war still. Yeah, and no one even knows what this early on as of this recording, no one even knows what nuclearization, that word nuclear, what that even means in this case. Does that means we're not we're gonna stop our building programs, but we're keeping those missiles or does this mean we're going to destroy everything? Right? That is another reason why it's so surprising. But the whole reason that this is such big news is because and the reason that this this this summit is is even on the world stage is because North Korea has finally gotten to a point where they are they have just come out of being strictly a regional threat and a big regional threat to South Korea and to Japan, but now they're actually a threat to the United States because they've just shown through an intercontinental ballistic missile test that had the trajectory been a certain way, they could have hit Chicago. And that changes everything. And then of course after that, we conducted a test of our SAD system Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. I looked into that. You know what that thing is? It is, uh it basically shoots the rocket out of the sky in orbit. But it doesn't like it doesn't have any um explosives. It just it works through velocity. So just punches right through. It punches right through it with the idea that it won't detonate the nuclear warhead smart so it'll just disable the rocket and uh, I guess it'll just tumble back into the atmosphere in land where it may right hopefully the ocean. It's probably gonna try to shoot it down over the ocean. I think it's the idea, right, So I saw that we have a about a fifty fifty chance of shooting down any I c b M coming out in North Korea. Yeah, which is as Mark Bowden put it in this article that I read, it's good, but at the other hand, it's actually really bad because that's even that that I CBM will strike the United States if they shoot it. So the point is North Korea showed that they actually have this technology now and it changed everything. So the idea that they just proved that they could do this and are now saying, let's d nuclear eyes. That's huge and crazy. And actually people are talking about no bells over all this. Yeah, I mean left leaning websites are are saying Donald Trump has done what no other president has been able to do. Potentially if this happens the way it looks like it could happen, which was it's a shocking thing to read. It's a shocking about face from North Korea. Yeah to see c an nd go like I had to say it, but he's really done something here the end, right. It was written by Wolf Blitzer while he was applying like hot paper clips to his inner thoughts. Is things are getting strange. So it's gonna be really interesting to see how this unfolds um and whether or not it is a trick. Yeah. I mean, like it's it's really weird for weeks and months ago for North Korea to be, you know, saying like we will destroy you, we were, we will crush you, we will blow you to pieces, and like everything's good that they will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the US with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time. That was from July, less than a year ago. Chuck, I don't know. I mean, is it possible that he's seen the light? I mean, these sanctions have put a serious hurt on a country that was already in a bad way, right, but they've lived in a bad way for like half a cent well more than half a century. Now. It's so weird that it that's it's if that's true, then we figured out a sanction that no one had tried before and it was exactly the right thing. It's just too bizarre because they've lived with this stuff well. And but it's it also could be a symbol of just the changing times. And there are a lot of North Korean citizens now that are saying, like, you know, we should reform now, that now is the time to play with the rest of the world and become part of the rest of the world and not be a hermit kingdom. See it's my understanding that if you would say that out loud in the north, like you would be executed with an anti aircraft gun. Well, I think a lot of these have been defectors that have said, like, there's a lot of quiet sentiment. You know, I don't think anyone yet in the country is standing upon the rooftop side reform, because that's what Kim Jong Ung's brother, um. I mean, he was two women at assassins at an airport, sprayed him in the face with a nerve agent and killed him because well for a few reasons. One is because uh, it was because he believed in reform. Potentially, Yeah, I get that he was a little more Western oriented than he's trying to get to Disneyland, Disneyland Japan, right, yeah, on a on a Japanese or I'm sorry, Dominican Republic passport that he had and he got killed, assassinated, and you know, of course they haven't come out and said so but it's it seems like a direct order from the top from his half brother, who, unless I misread, they have never met or had never met. That's possible because I think the tradition is he raise potential successors in isolation from one another. Oh, I had not heard that. I just assumed that, like the first family was in exile. Oh no, I mean they were half brothers, and that makes sense, kind of like a little lab experiment, and see which one grows the way you wanted to. You know, one grew up and I was like, I kind of want to go to Disneyland, and he got caught doing it. Yeah, he was assassinated. I would guess. His name was Kim Jong Kim Jong nah Um and he was assassinated in two thousand seventeen. And Um, I would guess because Kim Jong un was trying to consolidate his power to make sure there was nobody who could be like, you know, built up as a leader in exile and come and take his bro was in line. You know, he was the first born. Right, So let's let's take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk about Korean history and maybe things will get a little clearer. Huh. Alright, Chuck, we're back. What an intro. It really was. Intrigue, assassination. I felt passionate metallica. Yeah, at it all I forgot we talked about in town. All right. So, um, let's go back in time because understanding and this article is actually really good on our site from Patrick Gold. He does a good job. Um that. The section is titled how North Korea came into existence, and it really just kind of brings it all into focus once you know how this all because I think a lot of people these days don't educate themselves. They watched mash and that's about the extent of it. That's about all I knew about Korea, me too, sure. So Korea was actually a for a very brief time in the twentieth century, actually not too brief, but nineteen ten and nine it had been invaded and annexed by the Japanese and it was in the process of becoming a Japanese colony when Japan lost World War Two. Yeah. Go look at Korea on a map. Start there. It's pretty close to Japan. Yeah, and it's also just it's a little little dongle peninsula hanging down from China. It also has amazing food. By the way, okay, so, um, Korea fell out of the possession of the Japanese and into the possession of the Americans. The allied forces that had invaded Japan and part and parcel with that was invading Korea as well. Right, So, because the United States and the uss are divided up the world, basically one of the things that got divided was the Korean Peninsula. And right at the thirty parallel, above it was the North, and below it was the South, and the South was controlled by the US supported Sorry I just made scare quotes for those of you can't see me. And the North was a puppet regime installed by the USSR. Yeah, pretty simple, okay, uh, so to to run the show up there in North Korea. Um, this is really interesting how this dynasty started with the with this family that's been in power for so long. Yes, the Soviets said, all right, Kim Il sung, you were born Kim Song jew In, you grew up in China mainly, and we're gonna install you as a leader, and we're gonna tell everybody at least that you were a very brave leader and fighter in the resistance against the Japanese. However, no one really knows if that's true or not. He might have pulled the Don draper. In fact, there are but the probably shouldn't eat while it's too late now. Uh. There are some people believe that he is living under or lived under an assumed identity from another guerrilla fighter who who died in battle, who actually was like a glorious resistance leader against the Japanese. Yes, so this family that has been ruling since the mid forties may not have even had any legitimate claim whatsoever. Right, so so amazing, So Yes, it's it's entirely possible that the first president of North Korea, who's known as the Eternal President Kim Il sung, was an impostor. That's not widely widely confirm. It's not confirmed at all, uh, and it's not necessarily widely held. But there's at least one Korean analyst out there who says is that the deal. Is it a fringe like, uh, conspiracy theory? No? Is it a little more like, Hey, this might be real. I think I think the ladder of the two. I don't think it's a conspiracy theory at all. I think it's entirely possible. Either way, it doesn't matter because what happened was whether this guy was the guy or whether this guy was the guy posing as that guy. This person Kim il sung. With the world knows that Kim Il sung was installed as the leader of Soviet controlled North Korea right after um the World War to also a similar haircut, yeah to his grandson. Sure they all kind of had that look. Oh yeah, well Kim Jong il had his own look. He had the little mini fro going on. Yeah, but correct short, you know, crops close on above the years of fondness for coverall pants suits. Uh, all right, So nineteen forty he joins the Soviet Red Army. This is Kim illsong uh In forty six, Stalin makes him what they called the head of North Korean Temporary People's Committee, and then finally they appointed him North Korean. The Soviets did pointed in North Korea's prime minister. And then you know, the whole propaganda machine of communism and especially here in Korea has always been massive, yes, huge, Right, So there was this uh, this woman I cannot I wish I could remember. Her name is Suki something, but she posed as a an English teacher for a missionary group in North Korea. She's actually a journalist planning to write a book. But she went undercover, which ethically there's a lot of things going on here. But she came back and reported on this and said, seriously, honestly, this whole country has suffered generations of psychological abuse and the propagandas everything to them, like, yes, some of it is overdone and overblown, but ultimately at their core, like they experienced happiness by thinking of of sacrificing for the their dear leader and their country. It's not about themselves, it's not about their friends. It's about the country and dear leader in particular, because yes, the propaganda machine works that combined with surveillance, right, Okay, so uh so he's in power. Um, the regime is going strong, the Soviets withdraw and there are a lot of little skirmishes breaking out. Um along that. I guess it was the thirty parallel back then. Even yeah, it's always been all right, So they were they were fighting a little bit back then, and I get the sense that he was sort of not well maybe paranoid, but definitely I mean, this article says he was uneasy, so he sort of overcompensated by saying, you know what, if you if anyone comes at me, you will be crushed completely. Um. He had a lot of fear that he was going to get overthrown from the South. Yeah, because I mean the Soviets withdrew and they were like, we're still we're still bodies, We're still supporting you, right. Our military is not going to be there to back you up any longer, which is a big deal. Right, But he said basically to the Soviets, hey, listen, I'd like to preemptively take care of this problem. Can I do this? And finally in ninety the Soviets said, sure, right, go for it, which was a huge surprise to South Korea and the U. S. Military. Yeah, we didn't expect that all of a sudden, the North Koreans overrun the thirty parallel and invade South Korea and almost had the place. And it turned out it was a small handful of UM Japanese regulars who had been UM I guess, flipped to fight with the Americans and the South Koreans, and they were the ones who actually managed to repel the North Korean invasion long enough for MacArthur to bring in American troops and push the North Koreans back up over the thirty parallel. Yeah. Like, I don't know a lot of military history, but from what I did research wise on this, MacArthur is a renowned figure for a very good reason. Like it seems like he pulled off a near impossible feat here. He did. He was famously fired in the middle of the Korean War though by Harry Truman, at a time when people had no idea the president could actually fire a five star general, especially the nation's most prize general. But he did. And the reason why I found was because MacArthur wanted to keep going right into China, and Truman and actually the Joint chiefs too, said, look, man, we are kind of overextended as it is right now. If you invade China, then we're at war with China. Don't forget North Korea is a puppet stat or it was of the Soviet Union, So you're gonna draw Russia into this war no way. And actually had to fire MacArthur because he was not um. He was publicly criticizing the fact that they weren't allowing him to go into China right, So MacArthur, though, pushes up into North Korea, staves off above the thirty parallel, and then in the meantime, Kim Kim il sung is going to the to Stalin saying, hey, I need them. He's a back up here, he said, I could do this. Now, this MacArthur guy is ruining my party. Can you help? And out of nowhere, to everyone's surprise, China comes on board, right because Russia said no, oh yeah, which is that's huge, right, So they left their guy twisting in the wind well, which, as we will later see, did a psychologically did a little uh mind game. There's some people who say that that that experience crafted the mindset of the Kim dynasty today. Okay, I mean a bit of an overreaction, but it does make sense a little bit. So the Soviets said, and yet we're not going to help you. We're definitely not about to get into a ground war with um, the United States right after World War two, UM. And then he turned to Beijing and Beijing said, let us think about it. And apparently there were two days, two long days before Beijing finally surprised everybody, like you said, and came into the war and those two days where the Soviets had said no and China was thinking about it, North Korea was utterly and totally alone and they were against the United States, and that helped create the mythos that still to this day is the the point the existence of North Korea. Yeah, isolationist nation that know that they feel like they can't trust anybody. They can't trust anybody. They are the defenders of the Korean race, which is the purest, greatest race on the planet. As far as the North Korean mythology is concerned, I didn't see whether it was widely held in South Korea or not, but the North Koreans definitely believed they are, and that the North Koreans are actually still to this day the defenders of the Korean peninsula. And if it weren't for the North, the American hordes would have overrun the Korean peninsula by now, and so South Korea should be thanking they're lucky stars at North Korea is there to defend them, even though the South is just a bunch of ingrades. That's that's the mythology behind this, and all of it is finds it's its place in the guys or in the persona of the dear Leader, whichever member of the Kim family that is at the time. Right, So after this happens, after China saves their bacon, and fighting, you know, fighting just continues for a couple of years before this this truce is signed. Um, bad fighting, you know it was. It was not pretty. Um, things got really serious, and Kim Il sung within his country said you know what, Um, I'm gonna go a little crazy here, and I'm gonna purge the system and anyone who's a threat to whether they're citizens or whether they're military leaders of my own. Um, they're all They're all gonna be under the gun, like literally, and I will kill them. I will assassinate them. I will cleanse my country of anyone who doesn't worship me. Basically, that's a kind of a good way to say it. It is. Yeah, like it was, it's almost like worship. He turned right, very much so, and it still is today. Right. Yeah, So I guess he turned since he his his campaign to retake the Korean peninsula was repelled, he turned inward and focused at all inward, and it became very very dark in North Korea. Yeah, he had fifty thousand statues of himself erected. And this is with a money from the Soviet Union in China that was meant to go to UM. I don't know things like housing construction and food and all that stuff. Yeah, so, I mean, if there was a propaganda machine before, it's it like he turns it to eleven at this point, right, And this is how this is how the place is going for years and years and years and years until the early nineties when something really significant happened, and that was the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union kept North Korea as a client state, but not exactly as a communist country. They had communist ideology, but you can make a case, and a lot of people do that North Korea is not actually a genuinely communist country because part of that experience of Kim Il sung being left a twist in the wind against the Americans by the Chinese and the Soviets was a concept called juja. I really tried and I could not find the right pronunciation, but it's j u c H. What did you get? Well, I mean, if you believe that that YouTube videos Emma saying what is it called Emma saying Oh, I don't know. Is that what it is where it does like the crazy circle wipe? Yes, yeah, they said, jusia right. I thought it was a little on the nose. Okay, I saw I saw in like written out and I'm no linguist, but um it didn't look anything like that. All right, Well, either way, this was in early nineteen seventies. This is the political philosophy, which is basically what they call here being the master of revolution and reconstruction in one's own country. In other words, self reliant, reject all outside influence. We're the masters of our own domain, except for whatever financial assistance you want to give us, right, but we're not going to tell you about that. We're not gonna tell you we're getting aid from the outside world because you're glorious, dear leader, and eternal President is providing for you, So don't you worry about that at all. Right, So it isn't exactly a purely communist country. It is its own thing. It's actually a unique country in that because of the Jusha thing and the fact that it has communist ideology, and then that it's actually what's considered to be a um ah hereditary dictatorship. Very close to a monarchy, but it's not exactly, although it is frequently called the Hermit Kingdom. So that's the way it stayed for years under Kim Il sung, and then the U. S s R. Fell. And when the U. S s R. Fell, like most of the aid to North Korea that kept things humming went away, humming being a relative term. Right. They weren't living large, no, but they certainly weren't engaged in famine, which is what happened right after the Soviet Union stopped being the Soviet Union. All right, So that's the Kim dynasty. Um, like we said, it might as well be a monarchy, but what you call it a hereditary dictatorship. And the whole thing is that Kim dynasty. Yeah, that was just Kim Il Song. Yeah yeah, Kim Il Well I was setting up with the Kim dynasty to follow. So Kim Il Song passes away. His eldest son, Kim Jong il, who most people probably know because he was around until pretty recently. He had a big part in UM Team America World Police too. I never saw that. Oh you're missing out. I know that one just got by me. It just just watch it. It's yeah, these guys are great and make sure you see the unedited cut version. Okay, uh so he was selected, well, he was the first, first born, the eldest son. However he was there seems to be a lot of leeway because it's not a monarchy under they select, and he seems to have been selected because out of the five kids, he was the biggest jerk. You know. This article says that he'd shown his um, his talent at um propaganda. One of the ways that he showed his talent and propaganda was by kidnapping a famous director and his actress wife from South Korea and forcing them to spark North Korean cinema. That was one of the ways he was a propagandist. Have you ever heard that story? It sounds familiar. But kidnapped a film director and made him make propaganda movies for the North for years, years and they finally escaped and did the wife star in them? Yeah? Husband directed at wife started him as hostages of the state of North Korea. And was it like, hey, we'll take care of you and they you know, gave them a nice place, or was it like there's a gun at your head, go make this movie. The first four years were spent in a concentration camp. The rest of the time after that was in the lap of luxury. But did a little and then or give very little and then take care of him right, sort of like a game, I think very much. So, Yeah, but four years in a concentration camp to start right, that's which means you'll do anything right. But but they were in the lap of luxury. The director later said that, you know, a lot of people thought that I was living it up. He said, yes, I had everything I wanted. But to live in comfort like that while everyone around you is an agony is terrible. Yeah, but that's something that the Kim dynasty doesn't seem to mind so much because they very much live in the lap of luxury. Obviously, so Kim Jong il he inherits in North Korea that's not in good shape. The Soviets are gone economically, like you said, they are uh, like you mentioned, there was there was a brutal famine. Um, there were floods, there were draughts. About two and a half million people supposedly died of starvation. And so he said, all right, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna maybe try some small economic reform and in the early two thousands he started sim allowing a semi private markets to a merge. But it was not much, certainly, not the kind of thing to turn the country's economy around. Not enough for sure. Yeah. So, um, after the Soviet Union fell, they were down to one state and they still received outside aid unless somebody had a sanction du jour against them. But the one country they could rely on was China for for financial aid. So, but they were dead. They used to be the Soviet Union and China, and then all of a sudden, the Soviet Union went away and then it was China. Well that's why the most recent, uh, the most recent UM sanctions have packed such a punch, because China got involved. Because you're saying earlier, like whatever sanctions, it's because China, I think, Well that that was That was part of Obama's UM what's it called the strategic Patients was basically being like you, guys, when I act like a bread that's fine. Check out our military over here. And while you're just over here being like this, We're gonna go to China put pressure on China, like China was the key you get China further and further out onto the world stage, more and more ameshed in global markets, the less they're going to tolerate outbursts by North Korea. And if you take China away from North Korea, north Korea has done the strategic patients is has there ever been a more like Obama esque term well and just government crafted. Yeah, it's like, here's a good one to try it out there. Strategic. But that was one thing and one reason why a lot of people are crediting Trump with with this about face. And we'll talk more about this, but it's worth saying right now is because he very much went against strategic patients and his whole thing was a show of bluster and strength saying We're not going to put up with your crap. Don't push me, fella, and they it's a lot of people are saying that this is this is why I actually got North Korea at the table. Did he like actually scared that? To me, though, is like, that's what makes it so unbelievable to me, That's what makes me suspicious of the whole thing. That that that that is what worked. Yeah, that the Kim family scared that easily. I don't know, man, who knows. Uh, alright, so semi private markets not working out too well, certainly not turning the country around. Uh. Kim Jong ill died in two thousand and eleven of a heart attack. And we're skipping over a lot off like if you want to if you want to know more about just how bizarre North carea class right, but but also specifically look at Kim Jong eels reign, like he was well known for importing nearly a million dollars or the kagnac into his country every year when the the average wage wass like just crazy stuff, crazy stuff. But he was also able to be bought off. That was a big one. Yeah, what was um? I know, I think this was for Kim il sung when when they first got the propaganda machine going that they said things like he, uh, the first time he went bowling, he scored a three hundred and the first time he went golfing he got eleven straight holes in one the first time ever. That's so funny that like it just sounds like something like they're got a third grader, so right, the his hit backstory, right, Oh, I know, I got it. This is going to knock their socks off. He grew full Beard when he was four, right, just because he could. So you got Kim jong Kim Kim Il song, and then Kim Jong il his son, and then Kim Jong il dies and Kim Uh Kim jong un takes over and he's the third in line. I think he was like twenty seven when he took over, and he was different for sure. He had been exucated in Switzerland. He was a fan of um western music. I love basketball. Basketball is huge in North Korea, but they actually have slightly altered UM rules. Like there's such a thing as a four pointer. Did you know? Really? Yeah? What is that? Just a super long shot? I don't know, but I do know that if you miss free throws you actually lose points. Oh interesting, kind of a good idea. Yeah, it really puts the puts the heat on you. That sounds like something that whatever the XFL version of the NBA would do, right, you know, but this is the North Korean version of the NBA. Or like if you shoot a three pointer or with your with your eyes closed behind your back, over your head, so explains Dennis Rodman at least right sort of talk about Dennis Rodman. Well, I mean I don't have a whole lot on him, other than he very famously made the news. Uh was it a couple of years ago and then again within the last year or so. Yeah, by going over there and kind of being buddies with him and then coming back and saying he's not such a bad guy. Yeah, it was. He was super criticized for Robin was because he didn't go under the premature of the State Department or anything like, we did not send him. He was a rogue envoy. But at the same time, some people were saying, like, hey, man, a rogue envoy is an unofficial ambassador to North Korea. Is better than the status quo. Right now, let's see what he comes back with. Um. One of the things he said was that Kim Jong un lives basically on a bitha or Hawaii, except he's the only one that lives there. Yeah, he lives on an island off the coast, a gorgeous tropical island of his own, right. Um. And there's lots of other stuff that Robmin came back with. But the point was, there is a period of time where Dennis Robin was the unofficial ambassador to North Korea for the United States. Right, I'm sure. I'm sure they showed him a great time. Rodin was probably like, oh man, that dude knows how to party, right. And so with Kim Jong ou coming in like this being Western influenced in some ways, um, there was a lot of hope that he was going to open up the country. He was going to drop the saber rattling and belicosity of his predecessors, his father and his grandfather, and that maybe maybe the North Korea problem was going to be solved now. And it looked like that for a month, and then he started killing people. Well yeah, but that's why I think it might be real now, is that after he went through his his kill people face that he he might have been like, well, this isn't working. Sanctions are worse than ever. I've got this new president in the United States that um, uh, how should I put this? That that uh, that that wants to prove a point. Oh wow, that was very You should be the ambassador that wants to prove a point with his bluster and his belicocity. So maybe like it wouldn't be so bad to get get American movies over here, and and kind of like I'm young, and like he's totally watching all that stuff. Oh, sure he is, you know, but the idea the like, am I really threatened by my own citizens? I don't know if he's threatened by it. And this probably isn't a huge factor, but the the amount of psychic damage that that would do if it wasn't properly handled by their propaganda machine, would it would just supposedly mentally crumble or emotionally crumble a significant portion of their population who are just so dedicated to this that the idea of North Korea suddenly laying down its arms when the whole purpose of North Korea's existence was to be armed against an American invasion, it would It doesn't fit it, So it doesn't make sense. All right, Well here here, let's talk about is killing people phase and then take a break. Sounds good because I don't want to leave people hanging. Okay, So, like you said, he comes in there, he's in his late twenties, mid twenties, and in his first five years he's just executing people left and right. Yeah, Like basically his father's contemporaries. One of the guys was his uncle. Hundred and forty senior members of the military government and the party elite, his uncle. Like you said, how did you kill his uncle? Tell him? Well, uh, if you believe reports, he was literally torn apart by an anti aircraft gun in front of his family. In front of his family, which that's not a good look, like a four barreled gun used to shoot down planes. They used on hean young Choi who was also his defense minister, and his uncle and and if you believe reports, which I mean they have to be true, had his his half brother assassinated by two female assassins sprang him in the face in an airport because he's trying to go to Disneyland. I also saw reports that he had um I think also by anti aircraft gun, executed his mistress and there was um suspicions that it was at his wife's behest. Yeah. Um, so that happened like right after he came to power. To that basically signaled like nope, this guy's this guy's following in the family footsteps for sure. Well, there was a very embarrassing video of his uncle um nodding off at an event. Oh that's what got him killed. Huh, he was the guy that was the guy who did that. Yeah, I mean that may have been the tipping point, but you know, he wanted him out of there for whatever reasons. But he was caught on video napping at an event where Kim Jong n was and that I think was what seals fate. You know, Chuck, Like, if you listen to us, we're both kind of hedging, like if these reports were true, or reports say this or whatever. We were raised in the Cold War, right, and once the Cold War was over, we realized that a lot of the stuff we were told about the Soviet Union was just total b Yes, so I think we're we can't help but approach. You know what We've been told about North Korea with the same kind of suspicion, Right, but from what I've seen, a lot of this stuff seems to be totally true, like it doesn't need to be exaggerated, which is really jarring. Yeah, you want to take a break now, Yeah, let's do it, Okay, Okay. So North Korea is known as the Hermit Kingdom, and for good, good measure, right, for good reason, they have sealed themselves off as much as is possible in today's modern age of information, pretty successfully sealed himselves off from the rest of the world. Yeah, Oh yeah, I'll bet other totalitarian states are just like those guys do it, right, They really do so. One of the ways that they do, like they really keep outside influences to a very large degree outside right, Um, the radios that you buy. And again I can't help but see us in like fifteen years being like, I can't believe we said that was in fact. But what I've been told is that the radios and televisions that you buy in North Korea are pre set to the state channels so that they can't tune in anything but the state approved media. Yeah. No, no labor unions, no independent news media. They jam networks foreign like broadcasts from coming in. Right, they still use Yahoo netscape. Uh. People, there are public executions. It's very grizzly scene, um to keep everyone um in line their labor camps. I took issue with the public execution thing because I think that that's like, that's pretty standard. It's like something the state does any state. Oh you mean to keep people in line our own executions of criminals. Yeah, everybody does that. It's like to keep people in line. Yeah, but I think when they say public it's probably broadcast on television. See that kind of thing whereas we don't do that yet. No, there was a moment do you remember that that um TV special that almost aired in like the late nineties early two thousands where they were gonna they were going to broadcast in execution on like Fox or something that's horrific. Uh So, Yeah, force labor camps, um and and this is startling to supposedly sometimes like you could be in a labor camp because of a sin uh quote sin unquote that your grandfather committed. Yeah, they have like a three generation rule in some cases where if who did something, they would put you and then two other generations of your family into a labor camp. Forced labor camp, not fun labor camp. A forced labor not a fun labor camp. We already talked about the hairstyles. Go look up the posters what's approved. The women's hair styles are not current to say the least. The men's hair styles are kind of all the same version of the Kim family, which is to say, high and tight. Yeah, they look like a racist bugs bunny western propagandy cartoon. I don't even know what that means. Look it up, okay, Um. We talked about their military for the size of their country. Their military is huge. They only have million people and they have one point two million full time service members that's just full time, and another almost eight million reservists. That's insane. Yeah, compared to South Korea, they have twice the population and only about six d and fifty five thousand full time soldiers. And from what I understand, if you just put North Korea against South Korea, South Korea would whip North Korea just wallop them militarily, right, even though they have half the soldiers. But that's not to say that North Korea has some slouchy, sloppy military. They spend almost all of their money on their military, and it's actually pretty top notch. Plus it's it's peopled by extraordinarily dedicated soldiers. Yeah that they parade through their every October. Everyone's seeing those parades with the tanks and the I c b ms and it's a big show. It's a big show. Yeah, it's gonna follow that up, but that's what it is. You just say it twice. It's just a big show. It's the description. So nice, you said it twice. Um, they're g d P is small. It's just about forty billion. Um. They like we said, they have a life. There isn't isn't fun. They don't produce a lot um. They certain they can't produce enough for themselves, so they're really reliant. That's why these sanctions are put such a whopping on them because they really rely on imports and exports to get by. Right. But one of the things that workers have to do, no matter what your industry is, almost all workers have to stay after work. Part of part of your job is after you're done laboring for the day. God, this is so bleak, you have to stick around for mandatory government meetings. And there's two varieties, right. There's one um where it's called the community session where they talk about you know, production goals and stuff like that. That's fine, I mean it's like a work meeting basically. But then there's the learning session, and that's just yeah, that's when you basically rap people out, even yourself, wrap yourself out on if you break broke any rules, if you saw someone breaking rules. Uh. And apparently this is where the defectors have shed a little light and said that that people aren't coming to these as much as they used to because things are so bad here. People need the spare time after work to go in and hunt and scour the for food. Yeah, you've got to look for food there. You might also be just sick, not like you basically have to work, but you're just too sick to stick around for the learning session, right, Well, yeah, I mean it's amazing the physical hole that life. And this is just since the forties that it's taken. The life expectancy is UM sixty seven for men and seventy four for women, and it's all compared to South Korea, which by all accounts, you know, it shouldn't be that different. No, No, there's literally divided families that we're still divided from the Korean War. So sixty seven years for men, seventy four for women UM compared to seventy nine and eighty five to South Korea. And then just their height and weight is different. North Korean men are between about two and four point three inches shorter in thirteen to twenty seven pounds lighter. That's based on a study, a study of defectors from North Korea compared to their South Korean counterparts. I don't know how how robust that is, but it's actually literally taking a physical toll on a population, and from all accounts, life is extraordinarily hard there. It gets very cold in North Korea, even though there's Pacific Um paradise island that Um Kim Jong Hoon lives on, uh In. In the mainland, it's actually it gets very cold in the winter. But they don't have a lot of electricity brown o blackouts, so there's a lot of lack of heat. There's a lot there's a lot of yeah, blackouts and brown outs. Um. It's a very hard existence, which makes it makes it all the more remarkable that they've managed to keep the population this devoted, not just in line, utterly devoted UM for decades, for generations. Now are they yes, how do we know that I'm basing mine on? I think from defectors, uh and I think from the the woman who posed as an English teacher, she's she came back saying like yes, She's like, yes, there are glimmers here. They're like curiosity about the outside world, about all this other stuff. Um. But there's so much self censorship because everyone knows that they are Um being surveilled at all times by their buddies, by military soldiers, by everybody that for all intents and purposes. They just the easiest. The path of least resistance is to just be dedicated and devoted as much as they expect you to be. Yeah, but my point is there's a difference between really believing in that and doing it out of fear for being killed. And like as soon as that Berlin Wall falls, then it's then everyone awake. But I don't know that that's necessarily true, because I think about people who are institutionalized in prison. You spend enough time in prison, the day you get out of prison is not necessarily like you're right back into society. And Red hangs himself in a halfway exactly. That's where I learned about this. Does that make that means it must feature so many lessons from shall shank Um? They do things like control or the ways that people can can get a little taste of the West. Is I thought this was interesting, is that they will um, Now who is making these DVD players with the USB China? Okay, so China will make a DVD player with a sneaky little USB port so you can have the state propaganda disc digital versatile disc in the player but be sneakily watching something else via usb port like whatever. Uh, welcome back Cotter. Yeah. I literally couldn't think of a name that's huge in North Korean Avengers Infinity War actually um. From what I understand, the North Korean media and on TV consists of three channels, two of which are available only on the weekends. And so the North Koreans really love bootleg smuggled South Korean soap operas love them. So there are outside influences that do trickle in, especially along the border between China and North Korea, but there's it's just not widespread, and it's certainly not widespread enough that there's there doesn't seem to be any internal threat to the Kim dynasty, Okay none. And the whole reason for this is because it's US against the rest of the world, and they've been They've managed to keep that mentality going for generations. So the idea that now now that the the Kim Dynasty North Korea has the very thing that they've sought for decades, U nuclear warhead that could pierce into the United States, now that they're saying we'll give that up, it's it boggles the mind. You know what's mind boggling is to go to an image source online and type in um daily life in North Korea and Daily Life in South Korea and bring them up and just to look at one modern society, uh, on one side, and then one on the other side, and realize this, there's just like an imaginary line drawn between these two things. Yeah, well, really unbelievable. Yeah, it's actually a pretty serious, very real line at DMZ. Well you know what I mean. I do know what you mean. Although I will tell you this, I was very surprised to hear this pot is not at all illegal in North Korea. Pot so they use it and smoke it. Yes, isn't that bizarre. I wonder if they do that to keep everyone just sort of but you think they'd be like, wait a minute, things are really messed up here. Oh I got all reflective. Yeah, look at Bob Marley or damn man, things aren't so bad. It's possible. It depends on what strain you're smoking. But look at Bob Marley. He was like get up and uh you know the other thing, Uh stand up? Yeah, but he was also like, let's go kick the soccer ball around. Yeah. Um pod also made him invincible when he was shot. Is Bob Marley shot. Oh yeah, he saw that documentary. It was really good. I just forgot that part. I don't remember why, but somebody tried to assassinateh he got shot with and managed to live. Yeah, yeah, would someone killed Bob Marley. I was just listening to uh, Talking Blues this past weekend and Emily was like, why is he talking so much in between the songs and what language is that? And I went, he's talking because these were studio sessions. It's called Talking Blues and he's speaking English. Is just very heavily excent it. Yeah, you know, like you need a subtitle almost we should do one on Bob Marley. I think you're right man. Have you ever heard his Dortmund Germany show from I think it's great. It's not just one of the greatest Bob Marley shows, not just one of the greatest reggae shows. It is one of the greatest live shows of all time. Yeah, check it out. Why that one? It just you know, when you see a live show every once in a while, everything they came together, just comes together. And it just happened to converge on Bob Marley and the Whalers and Dortmund, Germany in nineteen eighty. It was amazing. Yeah, I was at a show like that about a month ago. Should show, No, No, No, just Albert Hammond Jr. But it was just you catch someone on the right Friday night and the crowd, everything just kind of came together to where you could see the band look at each other going like, what is going on tonight? You know? It was just one of those things. I'm sorry I missed that show. I would like to see you. I interviewed him for movie Crush. Oh when is that coming out in the next couple of weeks. I can't wait to hear it. Yeah, he's an interesting eye, I'm sure. Yeah. Okay, So where were are we done here? Which do we need to know? We need to talk about what's going on today? That's right. I brought us up to today basically the idea that Kim Jong un, now that he has everything he wants, would just turn his back on it. It makes zero sense, dude, So what is going on? I don't know? Okay, Well, how about this? Um let's talk about Up till two days ago, there were there were basically four um ways of dealing with North Korea that had been discussed and bandied about. Did you read that Mark Bowden article? Yes, Okay, so you know these four four prongs basically, I guess that would be that'd be part of the last the last one. Yeah, but their prevention, turning the screws, decapitation and acceptance. Where where does patient what was obamas jam patients? Um? That could be conceivably part of turning the screws because it's sanctioned heavy. It's also in a way part of acceptance, depending on your take on it. But there were there were a couple that we need to talk about. Real quick. Prevention is a full on an attack on North Korea, a preemptive attack on North Korea. And here's why no one did that yet. No one's done that. It would be a devastating loss of life. There would be literally millions, if not tens of millions of people who died in the handful of hours the first day following that attack. They would be people who lived in Seoul, which is forty minutes south of the d m Z, and they would be people in Tokyo and elsewhere in Japan. They would just they would die. Because the North Koreans have not just nuclear warheads that are capable of hitting Soul in Tokyo, right, So right there, you've got fifty million people, more more than fifty million people, almost sixty if not more, UM, who are just vulnerable in two cities. They also had eight thousand what they call big guns, which could just rain our chillery down on Soul for as long as they were allowed to stay in intact. They also have nerve gas and chemical agents and biological agents enough to kill many, many millions of people just by releasing this gas. We don't really have any means of of defense against a gas attack, which is one of the reasons why chemical and biological agents are just internationally outlawed. But if you're a hermit kingdom, you don't have to play by those rules. So the fact that they have had all of the stock pilot at least since is the reason why no one has just gone in and taken out North Korea, because it would result in a huge loss of life that just could not be um morally defended. Yeah, I mean, geographically it's so unique, Um, like you said, with Soul being right there, there's just no way around it. The I mean, the the brightest military minds have tried to construct ways to do this, and it's just not possible. It's just not so. So prevention is basically like, we can't do that, which is one reason why Donald Trump's bellicosity really made a lot of people nervous, because it made some observers think, oh god, he might go for the prevention um choice, which is not okay. Right. There's also turning the screws, which is basically like a series of drawn out attacks with pauses in between to let North Korean know this is not the prevention. But um, we're still going to hurt you. But it would leave Kim Jong hoon in power on purpose to keep stability in the country. There's decapitation like assassination, yes, yeah, and that that's just tough to do. Um. Well, first of all, the U S supposedly doesn't sanction assassination like this. I think the rest of the world would kind of be like on this one. But at least the way this writer sees it is that any assassination attempt would require at least some kind of inner circle cooperation. Um. And that's just impossible, they say, right, They're they're so dedicated that they even one person wouldn't be a turn code no, and even if they could get them, these people are so surveiled and watched that they would be Yeah, it would be. And then the last one is acceptance, the idea that we would just have to live with the idea of North Korea being a member of the nuclear States, and that's just that. The idea with acceptance is that then you create a framework to de nuclearize them, um by continuing with sanctions, by using carrots and sticks, and and hope that they will end up behaving enough that you can keep them from using their nukes. So here we are today with a complete about face, and a lot of people say, okay, what's going on? And from what I understand, the talk is that South Korea is now headed by a president who's a liberal human rights lawyer, correct Moon jay En, and um the South Koreans and the North Koreans. We'd like to think of South Koreans as our allies, and they are, but they're also Koreans and North Koreans and South Koreans. They're Koreans, yeah, and they have family that are on the other side, right. So to be a Korean and say we want to just reunite, we want to end this this war first of all, but we want to reunite. To do that at the expense of the U. S having a post there, you could see South Korea being like, okay, let's figure this out. The problem is that leaves Japan extremely vulnerable because don't forget, Korea was a colony of Japan as recently. UM, and the US would very much like to have a presence on the Korean peninsula UM either way, and North Korea just wouldn't put up with that. So is that the case? Because I don't see any scenario where the US are just like, all right, well we're out of here. Then you guys, good, we're out of here. Right. I don't either, but I don't Also, I also don't see North Korea saying yeah, we'll unify and US you can stick around. It's going to be a very interesting few weeks. It certainly is. And we could talk about North Korea for ten more hours. But if you want to know more about it, just start looking into it. It's a fascinating country. Or go visit. Oh wait, you can't know, you can't not anymore. No, Uh, let's see you got anything else right now? Okay, Well, we said North Korea in there, I think once or twice, which means it's time for listener. Man, I'm gonna call this Walrus correction. Hey, guys a little behind recently listen to Walrus podcast. It's very exciting to hear some familiar places and names because I've just gotten back from the Arctic in the last month. I'm working towards my PhD studying Arctic sea ice, and I spent six weeks in Small Bard recently. Yeah, I know Chuck was excited to talk about as Alaska friend, but now you can say you have another Arctic friend, even if I technically live in Colorado. So, um, we got something a little wrong here emailing you because, um, you guys said Walruss can survive water down to negative four uh, and then Chuck said even down to negative fifty nine fahrenheit. I'm pretty sure you meant air, because water, even with a lot of salt, does not get that cold without freezing, certainly not below twenty degrees. I stand by negative anyway. I've been listening since two thousand nine, back when I was a baby scientist just working on my undergraduate degree. Still love the podcast. I wish your Denver shows didn't sell out so fast. That's from Erica Schreiber. That's it, that's it, all right, you left just hanging there. Have you ever been in a car where like you pressed the brakes, but the the it doesn't fully complete and you just kind of roll to a stop and it feels like you haven't really fully stopped, but you're not moving any longer. I have no idea what you mean. That means you have bad breaks? No, it just means like a weird twist of fate happened. It's it's possible. You don't lurch to a stop at all. That's what you just did with that listener mail. Thanks a lot, Erica, glad to hear that you made it back safe and thanks for listening.
