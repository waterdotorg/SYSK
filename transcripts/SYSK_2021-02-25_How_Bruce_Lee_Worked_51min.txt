Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry Roland, and this is Stuff you should Know. I couldn't think of any um, non problematic nicknames for us to use. Well, you could probably just go, yeah, that's what I'm talking about? Is that probably figure that? I'm sure yes, we would probably here about the man that's uh. You watch any great kung fu movie and they all make that great, great sound after a good death punch. Did you ever take kung fu when you were young or any kind of martial arts? No, I'm notoriously have zero interested in martial arts, and my biggest fears that my daughter is gonna want to do it. I oh really, well, I mean, will you tell her to sweep the leg at a tournament as she ever does? Yeah? Sure, I mean I wanted like to be able to protect herself, so that sounds like a very selfish thing. But as far as like going to martial arts tournaments kind of like uh, just you know, kill me. Now, what you should get her interested in, like, um, wielding a knife or something? It would be really cool or just being a good person, so people don't pick fights with her? Yeah, is that how things work? No, not at all. So I'll tell you somebody who liked to pick fights, not just would get into fights and accept the challenge, would actually pick fights. And it turns out that person also happens to be the person we're talking about today, one Mr Bruce Lee. Yeah, Bruce Lee. I mean, I'm sure, like me, you spent the past couple of days watching a lot of Bruce Lee stuff. But my question is were you into this? Did you watch kung fu movies and Bruce Lee movies only in so far as like the whole nineties like throwback thing. You know. I would have him on every once a while and watch him, but I was never super into my friends that were super into them. I remember, of course, I underwent extensive ninja training under since a Tommy Roper as a much younger person. This is in the eighties. Um, but I was never really into kung fu or or martial arts movies. Um. Outside of that, UM, I will say though, watching Fist of Fury last night, UM, I was just absolutely blown away like that. Yeah, the whole things I think black Belt Karate Dot com pirate of the movie and put it on YouTube, the whole thing, and it is just really good. Like the fighting in there is astounding and it gives you, like a really good like appreciation. It's hard not to appreciate what you're seeing with Bruce Lee when you when you watch it. Yeah, I have still not seen many of those movies. But for a movie Crush episode, one of my guests, um uh, Stuart Wellington of the flap House podcast, one of my favorite other podcast on movies, he had me watch his favorite movie, which is Ricky, Oh Colin the story of Ricky and Dude. You have to see this movie. It is the gory, over the top crazy martial arts movie to beat all over the top gory crazy martial arts movies. It is when was nuts? When was it made? Well ninety one, but it seems like seventy eight. Um it's it's amazing. Was there a shot where some guy jammed his fingers into his opponents testicles and then they cut to a view from inside his screwed them and you see the fingers wiggling. Did that happened? Because I saw a martial arts movie that had that and I was like, well, there it is. But that is the thing I've ever seen. It's got a lot of stuff like that. But I don't think that was from Ricky. Oh, but it's You're on the right track there, as far as you know. It's not for everybody. I gotta check it out, man, it's pretty fun. You had me. You're on the right track there. Um. So, Bruce lee movies were not nearly as violent, but for the time they were, they were exceedingly violent, it seems like, and Bruce Lee laid the foundation that people said, well, I want to top that. I want to top that. Um. And while maybe Gore there was plenty of like blood in in Fists of Fury, at least in other movies that he made, but um, it wasn't anything like what we just talked about. But the I think the larger point for Bruce Lee is that he laid this foundation, like he introduced the United States in the West to the idea of not just kung fu movie but of like Asians being heroes, like like protagonists, like like tough. You know, because up to that point, not necessarily exactly up to that point, but awfully close to it. Um, especially in the West. Uh, the people from China Japan seemed very docile, cerebral. I saw um not at all like Bruce Lee. And Bruce Lee changed all of that basically singlehandedly, especially as far as America is concerned with a single one inch punch. Basically. So let's talk a little bit about his early life, because he had a pretty interesting background, uh, pretty interesting genetic family tree. Um, because you know, we all think of him as Chinese, and he was certainly, he certainly was Chinese. But um, if you if you poke around his lineage and you will learn that his maternal great and father was Dutch Jewish, which is really interesting. He was a merchant, his name was Moses with a z hard dog Boseman, and he went to Hong Kong in the eighteen fifties as part of the Dutch East India Company. Became the Dutch ambassador to Hong Kong, had six kids with his concubine, and then one of those kids, one of his sons, Ho Kam Tong. He became a very rich man. He had a wife, thirteen concubines and a British mistress, and then he had a daughter with a British mistress, and that was Bruce Lee's mom. Yeah, that's it sounds more convenient. Yeah. Yeah. So Bruce Lee was part Jewish, part British, um and lots of Chinese mixed together. His father was Chinese Han Chinese um and his father was born poor. But he actually worked his way up to fairly sizeable celebrity in Hong Kong um or was it China? I don't remember if if Bruce Lee, if Bruce Lee, Bruce Lee's father lived in Hong Kong or China. Well, it was kind of both. He was a Cantonese opera star and an actor. Uh and then I think of visually they did settle in Hong Kong. Okay, all right, so um, but he was like very well known, like he was in movies, he was on TV, like he was a pretty famous guy. He was probably I would liken him to uh two, Jerry Orbach. He was the Jerry or Bach of his time and place. No, but he was like everywhere, he was in everything from dirty dancing to murder. She wrote, you know, like he was all over the place. And he was multi talented too. Don't try to tell me Jerry Orbach is not multi talented, because he is sure, but he was no opera star. Do you don't know that you're right? You're right. I could be I could be a martial arts expert. Jerry Orbot could be an opera star. Right, we could be whatever we want to be in our mind's eye. But so Bruce Lee's father was the Jerry Orbach of his time and place. That's right. So uh he was touring the US when Bruce was born. He was born in San Francisco in nineteen forty uh, and his parents named him Lee June Faun and apparently a nurse said you should call him Bruce for his English name. He said, what what did you say exactly? Did you hear what we named him? Originally? She's like, yeah, Bruce Len Bruce. Uh. They moved back to Hong Kong when he was a baby, and he grew up there, but he grew up with UM, going to English schools, English language private schools. Yeah. So um. He always kind of had this this UM I don't want to say split identity, but his his identity, a sense of self was deaf and divided between America and UM. I believe the UK to an extent, and also obviously Hong Kong UM and then of course his ancestry in China. Like he he he seemed to have UM not necessarily like felt spread all over the place, but in in a different sense, he was more open to influences wherever he found them. I saw somebody somebody say that Bruce Lee learned from everybody, everyone that he came in contact with, UM, including people who he had to fight, who fought of different styles. He he was always open to learning something he didn't. He was very cocky, he was very arrogant by a lot of people's estimations, but he also was humble enough to want to learn wherever he thought he could learn something new. Uh. And I think that that, according at least UM to again named Matthew Polly, who's known as one of his UM better biographers. Uh. That that really kind of underscored that that UM, that his personality just kind of being divided among different places around the world and having different influences. Yeah. So well, we'll take a little break here and we'll come back and talk about UM some of the early formative years of young Bruce Lee right after this and shock. Uh, alright, So little Bruce was born not only in the Year of the Dragon, but the Day of the Dragon, and his nickname was Little Dragon. When he became a child actor, if you only know Bruce Lee from his martial arts work, his kind of short career in martial arts films, he he was actually on screen as a baby. Um, but his real first kind of role was I think when he was like ten years old. Uh. Yeah, he was in a movie called The Kid, Yeah, which I watched some clips of this. I'm sure you did too. Um, it's you know, it's a cute little Bruce Lee. He does he kind of throw a lot of child abuse and was it really Yeah, He's like, he offers he has some money, so he offers to help his uncle out, and his uncle just basically deafens him in one ear. Well, yeah, I didn't see that clip. I would call that child abuse, chuck. No, two, I didn't see that clip. You're like, yeah, well, I guess if it's your definition of child No, No, not at all. I just didn't see that. When I just saw the one where he was kind of did that famous Bruce Lee sort of uh you know, thumb across the nose and throw his little shirt open. I know that's crazy that like he was that young ten years old and he's already like laying the groundwork for the things that we're going to make him famous in the future. Yeah, and he was a little guy. He um, I think, you know, as a as a full grown adult. He he reached five seven, about a hundred and thirty pounds. He was not very big when he was a kid. He was very small. He was fairly weak because of food rations because Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan at the time and they were rationing food out there was a cholera epidemic. He had one leg shorter than the other. He had an undescended testicle, which actually ended up keeping him out of Vietnam. So a little bit of a silver lining there. Uh. He had glasses, he had acne. I think his biographer said that he and this is the only person I really saw say that, but he said he'd probably be diagnosed with a d h D today. I looked for other places to find that, and no one. I don't think he's on record of saying that, but it did seem like that could be possible because he was very active, had trouble with focus, but could also hyper focus. Uh, and like he you know, like you said, he would kind of picked fights with people because he was a little kid, and that's a lot of times little kids will do that if they want to, you know, they want to prove that they're strong and have value, they'll pick fights and try and beat people up. Not not the way to do with their kids, no, but I mean, like, like, he was well known in Hong Kong as being like this kind of local tough who would start fights um and frequently won them, but sometimes would lose them too. Um. But there was one fight in particular that he lost around the age of fifteen or sixteen UM to a kid who had been studying h kung fu style called wing chun. Yeah, wing chun um, And that is where his famous um like one inch punch comes from. That style of fighting. It's really good for close quarters type fighting where your opponents right in front of you and coming at you. Wing chun is very good for that. So that was the kind of dude that Bruce Lee was, even back when he was a little hot shot fifteen year old, he lost a fight to somebody and he wanted to know how that person had beat him, So he went and learned it and that UM actually formed the basis for his UH. His formal education and martial arts was entering into the Wing Chun school UM at age fifteen. Yeah, and I looked a little more into Wing Chung to see what it was kind of all about. And apparently there's two sort of main tenants, which is the center line theory and then stand and guard UH. And the center line theory is basically, you draw a line from the center of your body to your opponent's body and that is the quickest route to strike. So if you've got someone coming at you, like you know, if you go throw a punch like American boxing style, like a haymaker, you're going up and around towards the jaw, to the side of the jaw. If you're practicing wing chun, you're standing right in front of that person, and as you're throwing your haymaker, you've gotten a very quick straight punch to your solar plexus and you're like, what just happened? That is basically the essence of Bruce Lee's as super lightning fast would take advantage of you while you thought you were about to strike him. He used that against you. Whatever flaw there was, and what you were doing to to hit or kick him or come at him, he would he would take advantage of it and hit you within that time. And and like if you watch any of his movies, you can see it quite clearly. But he'd been working on that. I didn't realize that was necessarily wing Chun. I thought that was his own style. Um, but it would make sense because again that was wing Chun. Is the is the foundation for his style of kung fu that he ended up coming up with. Right. So, Um, Like we said, his dad was fairly famous. Bruce's in the Jerry or box level famous. Don't forget Bruce's in this movie when he was ten years old, called the kid that was a big success. And then they said, hey, let's sign this kid up to do some sequels. And his dad said, no, no, no, no, no, My kid's not gonna be an actor. He's going to be a doctor or a lawyer or something like that. Um. And he's always in trouble in school, so I'm not gonna let him be in uh sign this contract. Uh. He ended up being in some movies kind of off and on. I think he ended up being in about twenty different movies that before his kung fu movie days, but it was never like he never turned into the big kids star that they were trying to get him to be with that first contract. I think, yeah, apparently he would have been had his father not directly intervened to make sure that didn't happen, which is pretty interesting. But he can't sign a contract without daddy saying so and mommy saying so. Well, yeah, you definitely need to have your parents support like that for sure. Um. But so his father like stepped in and said, no, you're gonna You're gonna do something else. And um that was at age ten, I don't know, I think at least eighteen at the latest. But at some point he um had kind of gotten like, like I said, he had a reputation as like local tough street fighter in Hong Kong. Um, and I guess he fought another kid and and beat him quite badly. And the kid turned out to be the son of a local mob boss. I don't know if he's a boss or a connected mob guy, but it's a member of the triad. It does sound like a movie. And um, that between that and the Hong Kong police basically saying like, look, your kid is totally on our radar and it's a real problem and he's going to end up in jail or dead if he keeps this stuff up. And by the way, the local the local mob now wants to kill him because he beat up one of the one of the boss's sons. Um his father was said, you're out of here. You're going to America. Um. Which again this wasn't like a complete out of the blue place to send Bruce Lee. This was the land that he was born. He was he had an American passport, he was an American by birth, and he also had family there too, But this is the first time that he was living on his own. From what I saw, his father gave him eight hundred dollars, which is pretty substantial back then, said here the addresses of some family in the Pacific Northwest. Head on out to San Francisco. And he started in San Francisco and ended up in Seattle pretty quickly, I believe, Yeah, Seattle in the um. In college, he went to you dub and he you know that money obviously would run out, so he had to get a job. He worked as a bus boy in a Chinese restaurant, actually lived in the restaurant, kind of a closet type of deal, and everyone started hearing about his his martial arts skills and the fact that he was pretty good at this stuff. So he started teaching a little bit on the side in that Wing chun style, and he met Linda there, who would go on to be his wife. She was a fellow student of his. Um, Linda got pregnant and they got married. They were very young, they were still in college, and they had little Brandon Lee. Uh well, we'll talk about him later on, and then a daughter named Shannon. Yeah. Um, so, all of a sudden, Bruce Lee, who is a bus boy at a Chinese restaurant and also teaching um kung fu on the side, has a family, a wife, kid, then kids, and um he's got He needs money now more than he ever did before. And he has a pretty good idea he's going to start opening of a franchise of martial arts studios. Because martial arts was already known in the United States, but typically it was kept within the whatever Asian community that practiced it. Right, so like if it was kung fu, you would find almost entirely Chinese people learning it UM that you know, immigrants to the country, or they're the children of immigrants. Um, it's taekwondo. It would be like Korean families. UM. And Bruce Lee said, you know what, I want to kind of explode that. There's a lot of talk about whether he was the first person in the United States to come along and open up martial arts to anybody who wanted to learn of any race, any ethnicity, women, men. From what I saw, that's not necessarily true, but they that is UM often credited as UH as evidence of just kind of how UM cocky and unconventional and and um disrespectful. I guess of norms and traditions just for the fact, you know, or just for norms and tradition's sake. UM. And And I don't know if he was the first person to teach just anybody who wanted to learn, UM, but it definitely fell within his UH persona, his outlook of martial arts, which is, you know, I'll take what I'll learn whatever I can and put it in to my fighting style so that I survive. And UM, that would make sense to kind of flip it on the on the other way and say, well, you know, I'm going to teach his fighting style to whoever wants to learn it. Yeah, and it turns out it was just as he ended up learning Wing Chung because of a fight he had early on. He also expanded his fighting style because of another fight. Um, which this sounds like it. I mean, I think there are a lot of legends and tall tales around Bruce Lee as well. This story. The story sounds a little dubious, but maybe it's true. It's it is. It's not dubious. It definitely happened, but there, it was close to the public, and there were only three eyewitnesses there and to one gives a conflicting report from the other two to a large degree. But it's been so thoroughly studied and researched by some people like that Matthew Pauly guy spent a year just researching this fight alone. There was another guy named m Charles Russo who wrote a book called Striking Distance. He spent a decade on that book and he interviewed a hundred people just for that to for that fight alone, because it's the one of the most legendary fights that's ever happened in the history of a world, and only three people were there to see it besides the fighters. Yet they interviewed a hundred people about what they heard what happened. Basically, yeah, I mean, that's as close as they could get, aside from the people who were there, who were again saying, you know, this is kind of conflicting. But overall, what seems to be the ultimate upshot of it is that it was at least a draw. It seems like it was a draw. Yeah, he thought a man named Wong jack Man, and apparently it was a pretty brutal fight, like you were saying, very legendary and uh yeah, conflicting reports. Let's just call it a draw. Let's be magnanimous here. But at the end of this, you know, the sort of upshot is it was that Bruce was like, I have limits now with Wing Chun, and I need to, uh like, I need to be able to best larger opponents because I'm a small guy. I need to I need to really kind of ramp up my study if especially if I'm a teacher, and and kind of get better. Basically, so he came up with his own jam and that's called Jeet Kun do the way of the intercepting fist, and this was a little bit. He was a really really good boxer. I don't think we've mentioned that yet. Um. If he had only boxed and dedicated himself to being a boxer, he probably could have been like a belt holding boxer, uh and like an Olympic champion. Um. So he incorporated elements of boxing. He incorporated all the wing chun that he had learned. Uh. And then fencing, which his older brother did, which is you know, when you're lunging at your opponent, but instead of a foil, he would use his fist. And if you, um, you know I mentioned that the one inch punch earlier. Uh, there was also the six inch punch. There's tons and tons of videos and breakdowns of what that is. But that's what he was really famous for, which is basically and then Tarantino kind of you know, borrowed for the uh kill Bill movies. Um. You know, you put your fingers on like the stern um of a of a human and that's how far you punch from. Like you don't rare back and swing or anything. You just use your hips and your legs and you focus your energy and all your momentum to just very very quickly punch and push somebody. And and even from one inch you can knock somebody backwards like seven feet so and that's super helpful if you can do that. But what that one fight UM with um Uh Wong jack Man taught him. Wong Jackman kept moving away from him. And if you're fighting style is entirely about fighting in close quarters with your opponent coming at you. If your opponent is getting away from you, you're just kind of up up the creek. And that's what really kind of opened his eyes that he needed to expand it. And so, like you said, he incorporated boxing and incorporated fencing. He also realized that he needed grappling too. He didn't have any grappling moves, and apparently that came um into focus when he was on set for a TV show that he would end up being on for a season called The Green Hornet. She'll talk about in a second, Um, And apparently on the set of The Green Hornet, he would he was He became quickly known for actually beating up the stunt doubles rather than you know, pulling his punch and just you know, not making contact or just barely making contact. He was punching these guys and kicking these guys and Um they apparently brought in a ringer named Judo Geen LaBelle, who was a very tough stunt man at two time Judoku champion UM and brought him and as a stuntman, and the first day on the set, he picked up Bruce Lee out of nowhere, put him in a fireman carry like on his shoulder, and Bruce Lee had he couldn't do anything. He was just so mad, but there was nothing he could do to get out of this. And he realized he needed to incorporate grappling, and he ended up training with Jean LaBelle for a year and expanded his fighting style even further. And that fireman carry, that meeting, that fight, basically on the set of The Green Hornet is what Quentin Tarantino was recreating in that movie Once upon a Time in Hollywood when Cliff Robertson Um Brad Pitt fights Bruce Lee on the sound stage in the in the parking lot. Um and a lot of people were very upset because he took tremendous liberties with that fight, but it was based on this kernel of history that had a much better outcome than than what UM what Quentin Tarantino showed. Yeah, Cliff Booth, by the way, Cliff Robertson was a real actor. Oh was he? Yeah? The way I thought it was the basis from Italica. No, that was close somebody else, I think, Okay, um, yeah, I mean Tarantino, we we should kind of talk about that for sect, because he was taken to task by a lot of people, um, certainly people from Bruce Lee's own family for that scene, and they were like, this is not what Bruce Lee was like, his daughter especially, It's like, this is not what my dad was like. He was not cocky, he was not arrogant. He was confident, and he was a good teacher. But you know, Tarantino then fired back in some interviews like he was arrogant and cocky, he was known as this guy, and apparently the people closest to him said he wasn't at all. This is a misconception by white people, and uh, Tarantino took a lot of grief and sort of argued back, and then she finally, in uh an interview in Variety magazine, was like, he should just kind of shut up about this and and say I'm making fictionalized movies and not purport to know what my dad was like. Yeah, when it's coming from the daughter, it seems like you should probably just shut up for sure. Probably so, and we'll probably get an email from her two because you said he was cocky and arrogant. Yeah right, yeah, I was thinking back to that flashing back, um. And one I guess one thing I saw too kind of that gives weight to the idea that he had a certain amount of arrogance or cockiness or I can understand how some people would take him that way or portray him that way. Um. Is he was well known for going around publicly insulting established martial arts schools. Like one of the first things he did where he made a name for himself among the martial arts community, especially in the Bay Area, that some people say led to that fight between him and Um Wong jack Man was to insult basically every established martial arts school in America and say that these were, um, they were taught by old tigers with no teeth, basically if they were misguided, um, and that they were, they were just wrong, and that his way was the right way. Um. And it wasn't that he had it out for like the old establishment just because they were the old establishment. But what he had decided, um with Jeekee Kundo is that it was it didn't make any sense to train and train and train to know exactly where your feet are going to go and exactly where to put your fists or that kind of thing, because all that stuff dissolved in a real fight. And so to Bruce Lee and his fighting style, the whole point is to survive the fight, and so you use whatever you can get your hands on, whatever technique, whatever style is going to work. And that that really doesn't jibe with the idea of us an established, rigid school. So he certainly ran a foul of, um, of some of the established martial art groups. Um. And I think that that has kind of contributed to this idea that he was cocky in real life. I'm not his daughter, so I certainly can't say, but you know, um, that's that's what I was basing my interpretation on. Yeah, my read is that he was a business person and that he was trying to make some money because his idea was that he wanted to open up a chain of kung fu schools. Um. He goes back to l A to give a demonstration at a karate tournament to try and you know, make a little headway there with maybe getting investors or getting people interested, and it worked. He met a TV producer there and that is how he got the role on The Green Hornet, which, like you said, ran for a single season. And he stayed in Hollywood though, and he really got the acting bug. I think he was in a few, um, kind of smaller parts over the next few years. He played Winslow Wong in the movie Marlo in nineteen nine, and then he like you mentioned, kind of at the beginning, it was he was trying to do something that didn't exist yet, which was become an Asian uh and at least an Asian American hero, because they just didn't do that. They were like, you can play this kind of role. Um, you're probably gonna come in as the bad guy or something. You're gonna show off some of your kung fu skills, but you're not going to be the star of the movie. And he said, all right, I'll hang around here. I'll start making a ton of money teaching the Hollywood elite uh my fighting style and ended up making making some really really close friends, uh, notably James Koburn and Steve McQueen ended up being two of his closest friends over the years until his death. Yeah, along with um Chuck Morris of course. Yeah, he was a ball bear. Also saw Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate were two of his students too. Yeah, Roman Polanski tried to sleep with him. No, he Bruce Lee lost his glasses. Roman Polanski found some glasses like his at the murder scene, and Roman Polanski was very suspicious of that, and apparently he went so far as to um take Bruce Lee to get a prescription made to replace the glasses that were broken, and then wanted to get his hands on that prescription and compare him, and apparently they didn't match, so he, you know, he backed off. He suspected Bruce Lee and the Manson family murders. He the TB. I don't wanna, I don't want to put any words in Roman Polanski's mouth, but I'm telling you what happened, which is that he found these glasses and had him checked out. Wow, that's a Hollywood nugget, Chuck, that you just put that jewel in your crown right there. Well, I didn't discover it. I mean, I just read it. Yeah, but I mean, I mean it's well known. Okay, well whatever, you can wear the crown around me and I'll just be like I totally earned. Uh. He got really into health and fitness. Um, this was the time in the nineteen sixties, kind of before the big exercise and weight lifting boom and stuff that happened. He was he was eating protein shakes and lifting weights kind of before a lot of people were. And you know, he wanted to get his body in the best shape possible. And if you've ever seen Bruce Lee's body, then he you know, he did exactly that. Yeah, Mischief accomplished for sure. And I mean again, he was a little guy, like he weighed a hundred and thirty pounds, but he was just as lean as they come and totally chiseled like he he was very very strong for his his size and stature. Um, and just lightning fast too. But none of this was amounting to anything as far as his film career was concerned. He was going quite far as a martial artist martial arts instructor for sure, but clearly he UM, I don't know if his he felt like his calling was always you know, the movies or TV or something like that. Okay, well, then that would explain it. I had the impression that, you know, he just knew that that was something he could do. Um, which he apparently was starting to accumulate some debt, and at one point, to keep his UH, to keep his his chain of um of martial arts studios open, he decided to go to Hong Kong and do some acting rather quickly and pick up some some fast money. So I didn't know if he considered that like a step towards stardom or if that was just he knew he could go make some money acting and come back and pour it back into the studios to keep them open. Do you know. I mean, I think the studios were making his living. But I think since he was ten years old, he was bitten by the acting bug, which is why he went on to be in twenty more movies over the next eight years. And I think that was his true like I think the Kung Fu studios, in my reading, was the means to get to where he wanted to be, which was a big Hollywood superstar. Well it actually it worked that trip Um Like I was saying, he was just going for some money to keep the studios or his his studios afloat Um or open Um. But it turned out to be the greatest move that any actor has ever undertaken, just going to Hong Kong and trying to pick up some parts and martial arts films, and that's exactly what he did, and he blew up as a result. That's right, So stake our final break here and then we'll come back and wrap it up and spanking on the bottom right after this shock shock Alright, So Bruce Lee goes to Hong Kong to make some movies, make a little dough and he goes to Hong Kong and signs a two picture movie deal with Golden Harvest Studios and signs on for his first movie, a little movie called The Big Boss, which originally in the United States was called Fist of Fury. A little confusing because then there was a movie called Fist of Fury that also had an alternate title, uh to Chinese, the Chinese connection, but the Big Boss a k A in America at first. The Fist se Fury or Fist of Fury was his first sort of foray into those movies, and it was a big, big hit. It was it's it's hard to explain what happened that that first movie, The Big Boss came out and basically made Bruce Lee an overnight sensation in Asia as far as martial arts is concerned, not just Hong Kong Asia. He just became an absolute superstar. The Big Boss shattered the box office record. The previous Hong Kong box office record was held by the Sound of Music, and it had made something like eight hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars um. The Big Boss made something like four times that in its box office run um. And then as more Bruce Lee movies came out over the next couple of years, each one shattered the record of the previous Bruce Lee movie. So when something like that happens, you know you have something once in a lifetime basically on your hands. And he was right smack dab in the in the middle of that once in a lifetime thing. Yeah, And not only were these movies making a lot of money, they were really cheap to make, which was like he was like the Golden Boy, because I think Fist of Fury, the second movie, cost about a hundred thousand dollars to make and made a hundred million I think the um The Way of the Dragon made a hundred and thirty million and cost about a hundred and thirty thousand, So he was making like huge, huge money. I mean not personally, but the studios were making huge, huge money on very little investment. And Um, the thing with Bruce Lee was he was, like you said, he was selling these fights better than anyone ever had. And his speed was really the key to it. Um and a lot of if you watch a lot of older kung fu movies and it looks like the action is sped up, it's because it is. They would speed at the camera or actually slow down the camera to make the action appear faster, to make it more exciting. But Bruce Lee was so naturally fast they had to tell him to slow down just so the camera could like record stuff accurately. So there were a few legends that grew up around his speed. One speed and strength. One that he could steal a dime off of your hand, like if you're holding it in the palm of your hand before you could just close your hand. Uh, he could catch a rice green that that he you would throw at him with chopsticks. And these are all, you know, maybe true or not, but I just love these legends. Wait, you would use chopsticks to throw a rice green at no, no no, no, you would throw a rice green at him and he would catch it with chopsticks. That's way more impressive. So and then the last one was that he could he could punch a hole through a can of coke with his finger. And I hope these are true because they're so great. Well, if they're not true, that's okay. Like you're not the first person to fall for some of the exaggerations, like I saw Matthew PAULI was kind of not called out, but somebody made mention the fact that this is one of those top biographers, like one of the best biographers of Bruce Lee still said, you know, somebody got punched and they flew back six ft in the air and it's almost certainly not correct, Like six ft is probably an exaggeration. But the fact that things like that get repeated and like like smart people like say like this, like this is what he was capable of, like it at the very least goes to underscore his abilities. That they were so mind boggling that this is it's possible that that's true. You know what I mean, it's not like, oh, that's ridiculous. It's like, no, this is Bruce Lee we're talking about. I think I can explain the six ft thing. If he's it might be an exaggeration that someone literally didn't touch the ground for six ft, But if you look at demonstrations of his of the one finger munch, he can knock someone back six to eight feet very easily until they can like regain their composure. Like people are flying back six ft but not necessarily not touching the ground in between, you know what I mean. I think this was quote flying through the air. It sounds like the air little writers flourish. Yeah. Maybe, but I mean again, it comes like people are like, oh that's cool. It's crazy because we're talking about Bruce Lee. If if like my biographer said that, everyone would be like, stop the pressus, whoa you got a biographer? I question every I will eventually, I assume. But if people would be like I questioned everything that's in this book now Bruce Lee, it's like, yeah, totally buy that. You know. So Bruce Lee is uh made a name for himself. Now. He is drive around sports cars, he's wearing for coats, he is a big, big pothead, which is something that yeah, I forgot about that you don't hear about a lot. But apparently after yeah, but after Bruce Lee's training sessions, he would uh. He apparently had this wooden box just full of joints, also smoked hash and got really into this sort of hippie lifestyle, kind of grew his hair along for a little while, and I think it was wrapped up in this Hollywood hippie thing of the time, understandable. Uh, and his careers go along great, and it all culminates with a movie called Enter the Dragon in nineteen three. Big movie. Yeah, it was a huge movie. I think he wrote and directed that one, and I think the first one he wrote and directed was Way of the Dragon. But like by this time on his third movie, he was now writing and directing it, and certainly by his fourth one he wrote and directed it. I saw that the Way of the Dragon, a quarter of the script was just a couple of like just a couple of fight scenes. Choreography took up like a quarter of the script. Um. And it was this was the one that put him on the map as an overnight sensation in the United States in the West. Like the other two, the first two or three. Um yea, his first three had made him an overnight sensation in Asia. This was the one that taught America what a kung fu movie was because we hadn't heard of it before, and now all of a sudden, we couldn't get enough of Bruce Lee. Unfortunately, Bruce Lee had died a month before in one of the great ironic tragedies as far as like Hollywood stardom goes. Yeah, only thirty two years old. Um, if you look up Bruce Lee death, there's a lot of different stories and theories out there. Um he was. He had a mistress at the time named Betty ting Pie, and apparently he had been on and this is the way Chuck Norris told it too. Apparently he had been on back medication for a while because of a back injury, so pain meds for his back. Came home to his apartment in Hong Kong with his mitress mistress, and complained of a headache. She gave him, I think a different kind of pain reliever, although Chuck Norris said it was Ah, what's I'm blanking? Now? What's the thing you take to fight an infection? And uh, antibiotic anty biotic, which I think he just must spoke because that wouldn't make any sense. But um, that's what Chuck North said. Uh. So it took another pain reliever, went down for a nap, and died never woke up. Uh he um. You know, there are all kinds of speculation about what happened. It seems like it was just a reaction of these medications. Uh. Some people say, including the biographer, it was also had to do with a heat stroke because because he'd had one ten weeks before, right, Yeah, and he also um a few months before he died, had he used to be very embarrassed about his under armed sweat, so he had the sweat glands removed from his underarms. What and so apparently they said that could have contributed to the You know, his body wasn't shedding sweat like it should and that could have led to a heat stroke. I had not heard that before that. That definitely crosses a couple of tease that I had anotherwise seen. May be, but I think it was like ten weeks before he died, he collapsed when he was dubbing a movie in an on an room without air conditioning. It was really hot got that heat stroke. Uh, and some people are saying this all contributed with these medications to a brain edema. Yeah, but again, I mean the fact that he died mysteriously. This guy who's like one of the fittest people on the planets just dies after saying he has a headache and lies down and wakes up. That's just conspiracy theory fodder for eon. Sure it's still going on today. Like apparently that he had a break with the director low Way, who directed the first two Bruce Lee films, um, the first two kung fu films he was in. He pulled a knife on him because the guy the director had been taunting him and Bruce Lee was Uh. There was a legend that like low Way had had him assassinated by ninja or something like that. But the upshot of it is, however he died. Um, he died like a month before he became extra like world famous, and he's still world famous today. Like everyone knows Bruce Lee. He's one of the most famous people to ever lived, and he died a month before that happened. Which is you know, you say that and you read it and you think it's it just doesn't quite sink in and when it does, you're like, that is astounding that that happened, just the timing of all that. Yeah, And then you know, many years later, his son, Brandon Lee would die very tragically on the set of a film because of an accident with a um, a blank bullet, um actually shooting a slug out of a gun on set of of The Crow, right yeah, um yeah. He think he was twenty eight, and his father had died when he was thirty two. So a lot of people are like, well, there's clearly the Lee family is cursed, right, which is nonsense. I think you should probably just shut up about that, probably so, but um, one of the things that it's hard to overstate like the cultural legacy that he left, Like he introduced the West to a completely different concept of Asian people, like like, oh, they can actually like stars, action heroes, like they're they're not like you know, valets or servants or whatever. Like it just completely altered americans understanding of Asian people. Like it's really hard to understate that. And then the other thing too is you know, we were kind of talking about whether he was um, you know, whether he was an actor or martial artist, and a lot of people are like, would is Bruce Lee? Would he actually was he really a good fighter? Or was he like a movie fighter like Jean Claude van Dam or Steven Seagal, who like in a real life fight that we would just be hopelessly lost, you know. And um, because Bruce Lee died at such a young age, like there's there's not this we don't know or a lot of people don't know. But if you talk to the people who trained with him, who worked with him, who were there who actually physically interacted with him, like it seems like completely understandable that he was as everything you saw in film, he could do for real in real life. And you would never have wanted to fight Bruce Lee. So he wasn't just a fake movie martial artists. He was the real deal, and in a lot of ways largely self taught, which makes them all the more impressive. That's right, You got anything else about Mr Bruce Lee? Chuck and got nothing else? And maybe watch the classic two farcical comedy they call Me Bruce. Oh yeah, okay, I will check that out. That one more thing, that his death is untimely death led to a whole genre of movies called Bruce Floitation, which was basically fake Bruce Lee movies. They're trying to cash in on his fame. Yeah. I think he had a movie, another movie released after his tattoo, didn't he That they compiled like footage and stuff for I believe they were filming it when he died, and they didn't release it for another five years. Game of Death, that's the one where he fights Kareem's actually, and Chuck Norris is in it too. Game of Death. Yeah, that that fight with Kareem was pretty awesome because to see a man that tall, be that lithe and that quick was pretty impressive. And he was one of Bruce Lee's like genuine students, one of his long time students. And he credits Bruce Lee with his his longevity and the n B a UM. Yeah. So if you want to more about Bruce Lee, just go out and start watching movies and videos and demonstrations of Bruce Lee. There's a lot worse things you can do with your time and thank us later. And since I said thank us later, it's time for listener mail. Yeah. I'm gonna call this return of Noah from Scotland. I'm pretty sure I read this on the air, but I told Noah to rite in once a year. Um, and here's the follow up. Because you know, Sarah, the amazing eleven year old fan is now probably in college and has long since forgotten about us. So we miss Sarah. We've we've been ghosted. We've have been ghosted years ago. But this is our new friend Noah. Hey, it's me Noah from Scotland. You told me to write in once a year, so this is my annual letter in case you don't remember me. I've been listening since I was four and writing you a letter every year since I was five. I still live in Scotland and for most of the last year my mom's been home schooling me because of the coronavirus. It's not always great, but when I'm doing my own topics, I can choose them based on your episodes. My favorite was space weather, because I didn't know there was weather in space. My favorite fact that I found out was the most powerful northern lights can generate over one trillion lots of power, which is I think about three million solar panels. Uh. It was a hard sum, but I think it's right. Uh. I don't you're if you're asking us about math, and no we're just gonna say yes, you got it right. You just ran a circle around this. I don't want to be an engineer anymore. By the way, I really like chemistry now. I think the periodic table is interesting and I want to find a way to stop global warming using science. I love it. I've asked for your book for my ninth birthday in May, and I hope to get it because I think it be interesting. I'm glad you're still podcasting. Love from Noah and this was sent through his mom's Rachel's email, of course as always, and she added a very sweet note as well, so much love to the to Noah's family there. Yeah, thank you very much Rachel and knowing the whole fam for writing to us from beloved Scotland. Keep us updated. Noah, We're pretty your progress is just fascinating.
