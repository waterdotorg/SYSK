Josh: Hey, March is tripod month, my friend, and you know what that means. Yes, that means it's time to let people know about your favorite podcasts, just to share the sheer joy of podcast listening. That's right, it's t r y pod. Still in nascent industry. A lot of people don't know what podcasts are and helps everybody out if you would go out and just say, hey, family member, who I see it? Thanksgiving once a year? Right, you should try out this thing called a podcast. Here's what they are. Here's a cool show you should try, and here's how to get it. Yeah, and it doesn't have to be our show, just any podcast you like in general that you think someone else would like, just share it. Yeah, So get on board the dry pod train. Welcome to Stuff you should know from how Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant and Jerry's here is always So it's stuff you should know. Stuff you should You should have said that in a British accent. It's stuff you should know. Hey, how was that? It was great? You're a regular rich little remember the arrest development little subplot where Charlie Starren. It was thought to be a British spy. Oh yeah, what was for British eyes only? Yeah? But what was um? The name of her character, mr F mr F. That's right, that's right. Anyw I had some like they said that every time. Right, it was pretty funny. She's great. Yeah, she was pretty lady, funny, smart, Yeah, good actor? What else? That's all I got on her? She can macrom Oh really, I don't know. I just assume. Okay, this is after a great start. Uh uh is it's unusual? Odd even you could say that. You suggested I say the intro in a British accent because we're talking about foreign accents today, Chuck, that's right, it was COI mm hmm. I see now that makes sense. Yes, and we're specifically not talking about um. There's a thing sometimes that certain people do when they meet someone with a an accent different than their own, where they accidentally or sometimes purposely, adopted momentarily. Yes, it's called code switching. My mom has done this before that I remember. It happened when I was a kid. My brother and I thought it was so funny. Yeah. Yeah, And it seems like it's usually apparent of an embarrassed child. Sure, um and is there an explanation behind it? Yeah? Yeah? So? Um so this is from what I understand, This is the point. Right. So, our accents are extremely personal. They're part of like us individually, but they also signal our membership in different groups. Right. So, like a farmer is gonna talk differently from a stockbroker, and a farmer from UH, Georgia is going to talk a lot differently than a stockbroker from UH Portland, Oregon, right because it's the other stock market seat. They thought I was gonna say New York. Nope. Um. So when we when we code switch, when we meet other people and take on their their way of talking, it's called code switching. And I think it's a way of signaling, hey, I we have something in comment. I don't want you to be distracted by Yeah my my overalls with no shirt on are distracting enough. I don't want you to be distracted by my accent too. So I think it is a way of saying, like, hey, I'm, i'm, I'm, we have something in common. The thing is, accents are such a part of group identity that if you do that in front of some other members of your group, whether it's your family or your friends or whatever, they're gonna tease you. They are going to tease you, guaranteed. And one of the reasons why is because what they're doing, consciously or otherwise is maintaining the borders of their own group's identity. They're saying, don't put on airs, don't think you're fancy, don't think you're just like that guy, You're one of us, and and making fun of somebody who adopts someone else's accent as a way of doing that, it's a way of maintaining group divisions and borders where really, when you do kind of adopt someone else's accent, I think one of the things that you are doing is trying to make the foreigner, the stranger feel more comfortable. And having met your mom, I guarantee that's what she was doing. Well. I just remember the only one I remember specifically, and you know, you just said these random eildhood moments that sort of stick with you, was we were in Florida and we were talking with uh, an Irish woman. I believe she may have been from England, but I think she was Irish. And the other thing too, is, you know, I don't. I don't think my mom had probably talked to a lot of Irish people at that point. You know, she's from West Tennessee and moved to Georgia. We didn't have Irish people all over the place. She wasn't super well traveled back then, although she is much more now. Um so it was probably a bit novel to her. And I remember very specifically, the woman said something about going to Disney, uh instead of Disney World, and my mom said, she got kind of proper and she says, you know, we haven't been to Disney yet. And I remember my brother and I just thought that was so funny instead of saying Disney World. Did you guys make fun of her of the woman? No, I don't think so. We may have laughed a little um under our breath, but I mean, I don't think we. I don't think we even teased her. I'm teasing her now a bit, but um, I don't think like we made fun of her. Really. I think we just kind of, like my brother and I want to do, very quietly, looked at each other and in that way that brothers do, right, and then talk to each other like the kids and escape from which mountain? Yeah, or they telepathic? Uh, but it's funny. I was listening to um the Great Judge John Hodgman podcast with our pal John in Class Jesse Thorne Bailiff Jesse, and they had an actual case a few weeks ago that was very funny where this this mom um does this on purpose. She's a trained actor and loves to put on accents when she goes to places, and the daughter was just she took her to the uh Internet court and was just like stop doing this, like you've got to stop doing this. And the mom's whole thing, she was very just fun and whimsical and having a lot of fun with it. So it was really hard to to rule against her. But I think Jaman ultimately did rule against her. He's tough, but well, I think his whole thing was, like, you know, I think he ruled partially in her favor, like you gotta let him know where you're from. And you can't do it to like waiters and service people because their job is to like take your dumb jokes and and have a stiff upper lip about it, and it just kind of makes their job harder if they think maybe you're making fun of them, and you know, like you may not realize the unintended consequence of this is somebody may feel uncomfortable that they have to put up with this. Wow, that was It was a really serious turn at the end there, you know it did? I mean, you know that what's great about that show is it's they're funny cases, but he adjudicates seriously. I think, well, yeah, and then Jesse always shoots his gun off at the end. Yeah. Yeah. Uh So, anyway, I just thought it was pretty weird that this article came up and then that episode had just aired. But that's different than what we were talking about totally. Like I started saying, this is not that at all. This is a legitimate, super rare. This reminded me of alien hand syndrome and its rarity, um because I've seen different numbers, but the most I've seen is about a hundred and fifty um described official cases of foreign accent syndrome. Right, That's that's super rare for sure. And what makes it different from somebody taking on the affect or dialect or accident of somebody else. Someone's taking the piss, right, this is this is where you you can't stop. It's involuntary. Yeah, and you know it sounds weird. It's an ecdotic, and you just wanted to like poke the person who's doing that in the next to be like what are you doing there? But if you really started to dig into the actual cases, it's sad and a lot of a lot of cases. Yeah, Because again, your accent, what you sound like, makes up a part of your personality. So if you are if it, if it changes on you involuntarily, it can be quite traumatic for some people. You could have an identity crisis of sorts. Yeah. So, um, I guess we should just go ahead and talk about a couple of cases so people know what we're talking about. Um. The first one mentioned in our own article is really interesting for a few reasons. Uh. And it's the most recent case that's documented. Um. I'm sorry it's not the most recent, but it is fairly recent. Woman named Lisa Ala mia Um. She had jaw surgery because of an overbite, and then when she came out of surgery, even though she was from Texas and had never been to England, she spoke with a British accent and she's like, right, bloody hell and h any way, I I need our British listeners right in and tell me how how good my British accented. Okay, well, I'm known on the show for doing the bad accent, so I'm glad you're taking up now. Yours are good. I don't know minor. They verge on decent at times. Well there's carto iss and stereotypical, but really really good continuous stereotypical versions of accents. Uh. So she woke up had that accent in her husband and three kids. I thought it was a joke. Um, she had only been outside the country to go to Mexico and it was a real thing called foreign exit syndrome. Yeah, she'd never been to England. She apparently probably had seen British people on TV kind of thing. But her case actually is the opposite of what I was saying. She was apparently, um, quite shy before, and now she has something to talk about a conversation opener. I guess she's a little more chatty than before. Yeah, it is. It's it's the opposite of of some other people who have really experienced a crisis. As a results, she's like, well I saw him British. Now I guess I should talk more than before. So she sounds like a drunk cockney chimney sweep pretty much. And she does sound cockney to me. Really, I didn't hear I didn't see this one on YouTube, so yeah, we should say. You know, this is kind of like optical illusions. It's one thing to talk about it, you need to actually go see and hear these people talking. Um. If you just look up Lisa Alamia A l A M I A and you will find plenty of interviews with her. Um, she's she's, like you said, fairly recent. There's one that's a quite a famous case, maybe the most famous because it was the one that put foreign accent syndrome on the map, even though it was before the term was coined. Yeah, this one had had a much darker turn, um because it was during World War Two. A Norwegian woman named Astrid suffered injury. Um. And the ironies here are really sad. She suffered a brain injury from shrapnel from a German bomb and a bombing raid, and then when she came to she had a German accent. Right, very not fun for her, No, because the Germans were occupying Norway at the time, right, so people she didn't really know, we're like, oh, hey German spy, Yeah you want some milk? No milk for you? Yeah, she was shunned. Um. She couldn't even speak German, but she had that accent and was obviously very distraught by this, and she went to a neurologist. Name your Erman, Monrad Crohne. Nice job, it's a great name. And um he coined the first term uh for this, which is uh this prosody, which is a prosody is like the tone and rhythm of your speech, and the prefixed discs obviously is like abnormal or ill um And that didn't catch on too well. It didn't, but as we'll see, he kind of nailed what the problem was because you know, the the the non grammatical parts of speech, the prosody or what is affected. When you have foreign accent syndrome. You you have what appears to be a foreign accent, but you're usually your vocabulary, your syntax, your grammar remains unchanged. It's all the little nuances that make up your accent or your intonation or the rhythm of your speech that are affected and has changed. So this prosody is actually like the perfect name for the syndrome. Yeah, but foreign accent syndrome is way more catchy and that it's sexy in uh, neurologist named Harry Whittaker came up with that um so A Whittaker coined it in the eighties. Uh, I think two was when he coined that official term, right, and he he was a neuro linguist who did some pretty serious research into foreign accent syndrome. He actually came up with a four point criteria for diagnosing it. And the number one is that the accent has to be considered by the patient, the people the patient knows, and the researcher the doctor to be to sound like a foreign accent, right for pretty straightfor from what they are. Yeah, well that's number number Two. It has to be different from the patient's former prosody, noticeably different. Number three it has to be related to central nervous system damage and this one has come under fire under the last few years. And then four it can't be related to a patient's ability to speak a foreign language already. Right, So there's actually a condition, it's astounding to me. It's called bilingual aphasia, or there's also polyglott aphasia. And apparently if you suffer a stroke or brain injury or some other trauma insult to your central nervous system, and you know, more than one language. You may completely lose the ability to speak one language and completely retain the ability to speak the other. That's how decentralized our language processes in the brain. Well, yeah, because that's one of the factors in for UH accent syndrome is you could it's not like UH in a case where you might have a stroke and lose the ability to speak like, you still can speak in perfect dialect whatever that dialect is as far as being you know, articulate and coherent. Oh right, right, yeah, yeah, so you're you're yeah, exactly, You're not like slurring your speech. You just sound different and like a foreign person saying the same words would. Right, Oh, gotcha. Okay, So there's this four point diagnosis criteria that's kind of been deconstructed over the years. Um. But the problem with foreign accent syndrome it's, like you said, Um, there's been a hundred, maybe a hundred and fifty cases, So it's just totally up in the air as to like how did diagnose it, what qualifies as that? And we'll talk a little bit about how scientists have dug into it thus far after this break, so chuck forign accent syndrome. It's kind of all over the place right now. Right You've got um Lisa Lamia Um who woke up from jawl surgery with it. Apparently people who have strokes can um can suffer from foreign accent syndrome. Uh. And I actually saw one case where your foreign accent syndrome and one patient who suffered a stroke was cured by a second stroke elsewhere in the brain. So we have like it's very tough to predict what's going to happen when foreign accent syndrome does come about. And you know, there's been people from Japan who developed Korean act sense, or there have been people from Scotland who developed South African accents. Um. It's it's kind of everywhere and all over. Yeah, you can. One of the other causes. It can be from the onset of MS from multiple sclerosis. UM. This one woman that we'll talk about in more details suffered from chronic migraines but had a migraine attack so severe that it it's spurred this and we'll get to her. But all of these in a bucket from some sort of trauma or an event are called uh neurogenic type. And for a long time they used to think that was the only way that you could get for an excellent syndrome, right, because I remember that Harry Whittaker two criteria specifically says it has to be related to central nervous system damage. Yeah. So there's another kind called psychogenic, also non organic or functional or psychosomatic. But um, one of the leading experts said that they prefer psychogenic. Uh. He said because quote this term has the advantage of stating positively based on an exploration of its causes, that the disorder is a manifestation of psychic psychological dis equilibrium like anxiety depression, personality disorder, or conversion reaction in quote um, and you know we're talking about could be bipolar disorder, it could be some other form of mental illness. And UM, this really kind of rocked. I mean, it's not a huge community studying this, but the people that do are obviously super fascinated by it, and it kind of rocked their world when they found out that someone that had no head injury, no stroke, or anything like that would could have something like this. Yeah. So they developed UM first was neurogenic, then they developed psychogenic, and then there's actually a third one now it's mixed. So apparently it can actually be from a psychological issue that possibly could arise from, say a brain lesion. So it's both of them together working to create this foreign accent syndrome and definitely psychogenic. The psychogenic version of foreign accent syndrome differs tremendously from the neurogenic in a lot of ways, and number one is the psychogenic tends to clear up and accompanies say like a psychotic break or a manic episode or something like that UM, And as the episode wanes or goes away or clears up, so too does the foreign accent syndrome. That is not the case with neurogenic. With neurogenic, they have no cure whatsoever, and basically the only treatment that they can come up with is UM through speech therapy, where speech language pathologists basically retrained you to talk the way you did before. Yeah, it's also, uh, the neurogenic is also much more common out of the cases I think it's about are from some sort of neurological damage, right, So what does that leave for to percent or unless I guess you're accounting for the new super odd one that is could be both. Um. One of the more famous cases that kind of demonstrated that psychogenic f A S was an actual thing. UM happened here in America. There's a woman in her mid thirties who had a history of schizophrenia and her family and she was brought to the e R after attacking her mom's landlady. Yeah, this one's the most recent case actually, and she um. She she believed the landlady was practicing voodoo on her against her, and she attacked the woman. UM and throughout all this, during this episode, she had taken on a British accent and taking a family history, they found that number one, she had schizophrenia or family She was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a result of this incident, but that she had had similar instances before and during these she had spoken with the British accent. Yeah. I wonder, I didn't see anything in there about her if she like had a I mean that another personality. Is that multiple personality disorder? I don't believe. So that's not what I took from it, because that would make sense, you know, if you have a just a British personality that came out that's violent maybe or something. Yeah, well, I mean we remember we I think we've done one on schizophrenia before, haven't we. I don't know, haven't we. We definitely did one on dissociative personality disorder UM, which was just absolutely fascinating. But I was I like you, I kind of noticed, like, hey, what about multiple personality? So it doesn't it seems like something that would be right up that alley. I'm sure they've looked into that, but apparently apparently that's not part of it. Yeah. Um, another case that I said we were going to get to those, This one is really weird um and super sad. This woman named Sarah Calwill in England. She is the one that had the migraine that set it off. And uh, this one is super odd because she's an English woman who now has a Chinese accent. I mean just straight up sounds Chinese and like broken English Chinese right right, So she sounds like a native UM. I think Man Mandarin speaker is probably what we're thinking of. Who um is speaking English? And if you weren't looking like you would expect to see, say maybe like a middle aged Chinese woman. Uh when you looked at the at the video and no, it's like I don't know, late late to mid thirties. Um, Caucasian woman, native born English speaker. Who. Um, and she's who I was thinking of when I was saying for some people, is is a really big problem because it's presented a big crisis for her identity. She said that she can't look in the mirror while she's speaking any longer. She just doesn't feel like herself anymore. It's really hit her hard. Yeah, I mean she her case is really sad. It was I think two thousand and ten when she was diagnosed after this migraine incident and in um she couldn't work anymore. Uh, and she she has she has a lot and more issues going on than just the speech with these uh migraines that have come on. She's um got a whole range of physical problems that she's had to stop work. She's in a wheelchair. Even though her limbs completely work, her brain basically can't tell her limbs to do what they should do. So um from migraines. Yeah, from I think these really extreme migraines. I think they even likened it to like having a stroke. They were so severe. Um. So she's had to sell her house, and I think her husband is afflicted with something too. It's just a really really sad case. But um, you know, you can there's all kinds of interviews with her, and it's just so strange to hear that accent coming out of uh, this white lady. It is from what I gather, she'd be like, yeah, well, imagine how strange it feels coming out of you. Oh yeah, you know. And you know, I saw videos where they would sit down and play her. Uh and before I looked up further that she was having even more troubled times, it seemed like she was getting a little better throughout the interview through therapy because they were playing her. One of the things they do is they play old recordings of herself and she would sit down and listen to them and try and mimic it, and um, which kind of brought up one of my questions is can you even mimic an accent? Like you know people can fake an accent, Like can you even do that? Uh? And I didn't get an answer on that, but um, then you're just mimicking an accent your entire life too, even if you could you know. So that's problematic on its own. But um, it seemed like she was getting a little bit better in that interview, but apparently not. It's really sad, Yeah it is. I mean, like it's bad enough you've got migraines and then to have a crisis of identity. Yeah, it's yeah, not fair. So one of the other things it's, um really troubling is you can't just just go to a neurologist and get it cleared up. Um. They're a whole range of doctors that you'll probably see along the way, including a neurologist. Um you talked about a speech language pathologist. You might go to a clinical psychologist to deal with the fallout from everything. Uh, maybe a neuro psychologist, maybe a radiologist. You might see you know, six and eight doctors and still not get anywhere, right because I can't do a lot for you. We don't know how to treat strokes very well. And once damage has has occurred in the brain, it can be pretty tough, if not impossible, to reverse that damage. Right, it's permanently damaged. Um. So yeah, the the idea that you're you've now gotten a foreign accent. They're probably like, that's kind of the least of your words. You just had a massive stroke or a huge head injury or something like that. But what it's revealed to them is not that there's this huge mystery, and we we have kind of played into it a little bit by not revealing this from the outset. But you you, as a patient with foreign accent syndrome, it didn't hit your head and wake up with the foreign accent. It's all in the ear of the beholder. The whole idea that there is a foreign accent syndrome is as the way that it stated is false, and we'll talk about that after this break. Okay, Chuck, we're back. So I thought I heard you draw in a breath right before we bro That might have been did you have something to say? Yeah, I think I have a little trouble wrapping my head around this whole idea that it's only in the ear of the person, because if you know that lady clearly has a Chinese accent, it's not oh, I'm just hearing it that way. So they've actually been studies where they've played a video clip of her, audio clip of a person with foreign accent syndrome to different people and said, you know, where do you think this person is from? And the same person will get tens of different answers out of tens of different people. Yeah, I don't know. I mean that makes sense in some cases, I think, But I don't see how anyone could hear this woman and say she sounds British to me, right, well, no, no, no, she she definitely doesn't sound Bridge. But that's the point. She sounds Chinese, but she's not actually speaking in a Chinese accent. She didn't hit her head and wake up with a Chinese accent. What happened was she got these series of migraines, probably had some sort of stroke, and a region of her brain that controls the really intricate process of prosody, of making your tongue do certain things to intonate an accent, certain words in certain ways that make up your accent and your dialect. Overall that got damaged, and so now she can't control it in the way she used to before. It comes out sounding differently. And to you, somebody who has heard people speak in a Chinese accent before, it sounds like a Chinese accent. That's the difference. Yeah, so they don't get that. What I do get though, is we take second nature just when we open our mouth we talk. We don't realize the complex series of events that's going on to make your voice come out the way it does. So you know you're you're well in the brain, they think, um, and again the mysteries of the brain, they're there. What how you create speeches really complex and involves all kind of areas of the brain, but UH specifically damaged in the left hemisphere and the cerebral artery they know a lot of times can cause foreign accent syndrome. But when you're speaking, you're using your tongue, you're using your lips, your jaw, uh, your larynx, and the way all these things combine and who you are UH is gonna make you have and we should do one on accents period. But um, it's gonna control how your speech comes out. So and the you know, the one example they use in here is if you know you have a little too much to drink those you know, you might lose some of that muscle control and you might slow your words or talk funny or differently. So that's a pretty pretty basic way of understanding it. But um, I know, vowels are are sort of a big deal when it comes to foreign accent syndrome. Yeah, if you if you say ad and stay a um, or you substitute consonants like R for L. Right, so you're um, you know, uh, what's that? What were they singing jingle bells on? Um? Oh? No? Deck the halls on a Christmas story? Ra. Right. So if you were a Caucasian English speaker and that you damaged your brain in a way that the the part of your brain responsible for forming l's now formed ours instead. To other English speakers who had heard um native Chinese speakers, you would sound like you had a Chinese accent, because that's what people who speak Chinese do when they're speaking English. So you didn't actually adopt a Chinese accent. You're just creating sounds in the same way that somebody who was a native Chinese speaker would. Yeah, I mean, I see what they're getting at with all this. To me, it's a little bit splitting hairs. I think that's what I'm trying to say. I think the difference is this chuck with your your accent, your native accent, your native dialect is the result of your exposure to your environment right lifelong, all the people around you, all the stuff you've learned, all the things you've heard. It creates your dialect. Right when you suffer foreign accent syndrome, your dialect, your brain is damage so that you can't produce that anymore, and you just kind of haphazardly producing something else you don't actually follow. So, like if you took uh Sarah cal Calwill's language and had her read a passage from a book, and then you had a native Chinese speaker, typical accented Mandarin speaker read that same passage, it would not be the exact same thing. There'd be all sorts of derivations and deviations from that normal Mandarin accent because Sarah Colwell's brain was damaged in a certain way that makes it a totally unique accent. Yeah, I get that, but that happens within the Mandarin accent between people too. You're not letting this one. Just don't get it. One thing I do get is that there's no like. And this is probably what's so frustrating, or one of the things so frustrating is it's not like they wake up with a new cultural identity either, I mean, this woman still wants to have her tea and biscuits every afternoon, but when she says that, she says it with Chuck would call it a Chinese accent. A neurologist would say, well, you're just hearing that right, Uh So you know, it's like you said, people suffer a bit from uh their own like sense of self, you know, because see here's what I wonder, isn't in there Do they hear it in their head as their own regular accent? I don't think so. No. I think it sounds off to them, and I think it's probably distressing because they're like, wait, let me say that again, and they still say it the what they perceive is the wrong way, because apparently one of the hallmarks of for an accent syndrome is the errors or the differences that they make, uh pro in their prosody is predictable, which makes it like an accent. I mean, that's what an accent as is. You're going to drop your ta s or replace the T with the th, h with the D just about every time I add that are when you say wash um yeah exactly, Like that's it's a predictable thing, and that's part of foreign accent syndroma. It starts to happen in predictable ways too, so I would guess, yeah, it sounds off to them as well well. Because the reason I say that is because when um, like, and I think I've talked about this, when my grandfather had a stroke, he still talked, but it just came as gibberish. But in his head he was saying the things that he was trying to say, which is, you know, one of the most frustrating things I think after a stroke victim is I remember seeing him talk and getting so frustrated. He would just you know, say things out loud and it would come out as gibberish to us, but in his head he's still saying, you know, his English words, they's gotta make you feel trapped in your body. Yeah. Um. However, f A S is a little all over the map because there have been other weird cases. Because we've been saying this whole time, there's not un new identity. It's the same, Uh, You're saying the same words and everything. But there have been cases where people do substitute outwards, like you would say lift instead of an elevator, right, That's like the psychogenic version. I know, it's just so confusing. Well it almost makes me think, like, so before there was nothing but neurogenic foreign accent syndrome, right, everything else was you're just crazy. Now they they recognize that they're psychogenic f A S as well. I think what's gonna happen with more and more study, They're gonna just diverge into two totally different syndromes. Now, Yeah, that makes sense, you know. I think they're gonna be like, that's actually not the same thing. That's something totally different. Neurogenic for an extent syndrome is its own thing, and psychogenic is is something else entirely. I'll just make up a new name. Yeah. Uh. This one other case I thought was interesting about the Dutch woman, which one she was Dutch is Dutch and she developed a French accent, but she spoke Dutch using French syntax and occasionally for in French words as if she was a French person learning Dutch. And it turns out that she was a Dutch language teacher who taught French people to speak Dutch. And I don't know it's her psychogenic or neurogenic. It would have to be psychogenic because neurogenic has basically that original um Harry Whittaker criteria use different words and things. Well, well it was it has to not be related to the patient's ability to speak a foreign language. So like that she would be technically canceled out from neurogenic for that one, and um it would also it didn't have anything to do with with central nervous system damage, which is again that's why I think it's gonna end up being its own thing. Man. So interesting it is? Uh, that's all I've got. Man, isn't that enough? Man? Any language stuff? Anytime we talk about language in the brain, I guess neural linguistics. I just turned to Google. It's so interesting to me. Yeah, that's what happens when something interests me. I turned to Google. If you want to turn to Goo and learn are about foreign accent syndrome. You can type those words in the search bar at how stuff works dot com. And since I said that, it's time for Chuck administrated details. How was that? That was great? Man?
