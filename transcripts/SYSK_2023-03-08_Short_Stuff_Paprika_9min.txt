Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, and this is short stuff. Do you like paprika? I don't think I've ever tasted paprika enough to determine whether I like it or not. Really, all right, that surprises me. I've had goulash. I guess I've eaten Hungarian food, so I'm sure I have, but I've never been like, Yeah, I love paprika, you know, well, I love paprika. I love smoked paprika specifically. And this show is about paprika. And you mentioned Hungary and we'll get to why Hungary is known for paprika in a second. But it's actually the Hungarian word for pepper. It is from the and by the way, thanks to Patty Rasmuss in it how stuff works for this. Yeah, but it comes from the Capsicum annum variety from the long hum family, and it's a it's a pepper. It's a long, bright red pepper. And the flavor can be super hot or not that hot, hottish, it can be sweet, it can be smokey if it is indeed, you know, smoked over a fire, and a lot of the paprika. You'll see this is what you see. If you see the orangey red sprinkles on a deviled egg, that's paprika. Yes, for sure, it's huge in Central Europe, but Hungary is like you know, the you know, Studio fifty four of the paprika world. But it's also big in Spain and Portugal as well. And since you like it smoked, you would like the Spanish and Portuguese paprika, because they take for granted that paprika smoke so much so that a woman named Nancy Waldeck, who's a chef and cookbook author that the House of Works interviewed for this says that, like they don't even put it's smoked on the label. It's you just know what's smoked. Basically, Yeah, that's how smoked it is. It's so smoked. The reason that Hungary is known for it is because they really adopted it. It's not native to there, which is really surprising to me. It's actually native where you think it would be is Mexico and Central America. But it found its way to Hungary through the Balkans apparently, and it grew really really well there in abundance, and so it became sort of the national spice because it was so abundant. That was it obviously made it less expensive because there was so much of it, and at a time when spices were sometimes reserved for people that had more wealth, you could get paprika even if you didn't have a lot of money. And so Hungary said, we are going to base everything we make almost off this stuff. Yeah. What's funny though, is like that the Nancy Waldeck points out that still it's even if you go to Hungary, it's basically pepri cash and goulosh or peprikosh and gulosh are the two main dishes that paprikas used it, although in the countryside they'll use it in like mushroom soup and some other stuff too, but it's still like the two main dishes anyone thinks of for paprika outside of deviled eggs. Yeah. Emily went to Hungary this year or late last year. Yeah, she went to Budapest. Her friend was working over there, so she had a kind of a free place to stay and she was up for an adventure and I was like, go have your adventure. She said, I wasn't asking, and I said fine, be that way, go to Hungary. Uh. And she had a great time and had tons of paprika. That's one of the coolest towns I've ever been to. You me and I went for New Year's one year was awesome. Yeah, I've been there too. Uh. And our good friend Raymond the puppeteer is puppeting in Hungary right now. Oh man, a Raymond move. That's awesome. I hope, Emily says, because that's how you're supposed to. I wanted to and I was like, Josh, don't do it. Don't do it, just say Budapest. I came back from it saying that, and I got enough, like come on that. I'm just finally back to Budapest. All right. Should we take a break? Yeshack, chuck. I'm still laughing from one minute ago. Thank you too. I think it's very funny. It's very funny, so thank you. So um. I love this article says Paprika pride runs high and hungry again. Remember this is the national spice and there's a Paprika museum in the village of Roski and you can get basically if you go to Hungry h Nancy Waldeck says expect to see maybe twenty different kinds of paprika, not brands, like varieties of paprika on the shelves in any given grocery store. But despite there being so many, there's actually just four official grades. At least. There's plenty of different kinds, but there's grades as far as paprik is concerned. There's Special, Gourmet, Noble, and Rows, and those don't really give you any kind of indication of what paprika you're getting at all. Now. I think they just sort of break it up into how fine or course it is, and maybe whether it's sort of a milder win or a sweeter one or a hotter one. Yes, that's pretty much it. But so you've got special, which is very fine, sweet and mild. I think that's pretty much the paprika that you would get here in the United States, or that people would put on like their deviled eggs. Yeah, it's it's pretty mild. You don't want to blast people with the heat. So Gourmet is slightly course. I've never had course paprika, have you, No, I'd be very interested, and it can be hot or mild. Noble is a course grind, so not even slightly. Course, this is course, it's just basically a lump of paprika, I guess, and it tends to be light red. I'm not sure what the taste can be, but then the rows is dark red and that one can be very hot. So if you see a dark red paprika and it says rose on the label before warned, yeah, it's um. It's got kind of a bell pepper taste. It is like a chili pepper in that it can be hot, but it's not a substitute and a recipe necessarily for chili powder. No, that's good. Like if you get a chili pepper powder, which is not chili powder. But if you get let's say, like a chipulta powder or a you know, any other specific pepper powder, than the paprika may be kind of similar. But if you just get chili powder, and I'm not sure if a lot of people know this, there's a variety of chilis and coumin and garlic a lot of times in it. That's like a powdered mix. Yeah, it's like seasoned salt basically, but the chili version of it. Sure, chili powder is right, Yeah, paprika's paprika. You can't even really compare it to chipole or anything like that. Is it's own thing, and so they how stuff works writers go to great pains to point out that if you have a recipe that calls for paprika, you have to use paprika for it. Don't don't try anything else, don't try anything funny, or the people from a house stuff works will come to your house and take all of your spices. And apparently it's the kind of spice you don't want to buy a ton of because it goes bad quicker than other spices because of these natural oils, and it's just gonna go bad sooner. So don't keep it near heat, keep it in a dark jar, in a cool place. And if you go to use paprika, if you don't use it much, and you go to use it like six months later and it is brown, then it's no longer paprika, and don't use it, right. But luckily it's so cheap you can just replace it pretty easily. It's not a big tragedy if it goes bad. The thing is is it's such a such a in the United States, especially such an innocuous, overlooked spice that I think this should be one of those impetuses where people go out and buy paprika and then start looking for recipes to use it in. Just try something new. This is a great opportunity to do that everybody totally. So you can try paprikash Goo losh. And then Nancy Waldeck says, try Romesco sauce, which is an old world sauce from Spain and Portugal. And we say, go forth, try something new, and I think, Chuck, that means that short stuff is out.
