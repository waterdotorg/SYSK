Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from How Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w Chuck Bryant. There's a guest producer, Dylan Again. You know, Dylan got a job here because he heard of How Stuff Works, because he was a Stuff you Should Know fan. This might be the most thrilling moment of Dylan's life, the most thrilling two hours. Either that or the most illusion shattering two hours. I think that since Dylan started working here, it's just been a slow anti climax, down, down, down, leading to this moment of rock bottom. We're like that guy, rag him out. Oh how's it going. It's going terrifically. How are you Dylan good? He said, I see, he knows he's a fan. He didn't even try to speak. Noel will be like, well let me tell you, yeah, let me see if I can find a microphone. It just shows one of us out of the way, knows what he's doing. Uh. You know what. I couldn't help. But when I was researching this, probably because we just did this is think about Genghis Khan and if you go on the internet and type in Attil of the Hun or Genghis Khan. There are so many nerdy websites where people pitt uh fictional battles against historic leaders really yeah, like who would have won in a cage match until of the Hunter Genghis Khan? Right? But there's like actual thought put behind it? Or is it just like no genghas cool? There's a range from that to like the people who really put too much effort into it and um, but those are interesting to read, you know, like you've got to remember guys like Genghis Khan had a thousand years of weaponry development to his advantage. And when it comes to personal fighting tactics as opposed to leadership, those are two different things to talk about. And then their voice changes until they've become Toby from American Splendor. Genghis Khan was what a thousand years after at Till of the Hunt? Is that correct? Well? Because I thought the opposite. I thought he was BC And again, we just did a show on him, and I already forgot since here leven sixty two for Chingas and four oh six for a Till of the Hunt. That is fascinating, So okay, yeah, I mean ching has had a lot of advancements in that thousand years for sure. Yeah, And I don't know, I couldn't help but compare these guys. So I might just sort of pepper that in here and there and and comparing these because our own article starts out by mentioning Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Chingis khan uh as some of the most brutal conquerors and antiquity. I really appreciate you moving to Chingas might as well. So until of the Hun, he was around between he was in the fifth century CE, right, four oh six. You know, they don't know exactly about his birth dates, but they're they're putting it around four or six. No, we should do this, Um, we should do this chronologically. But I think we should say out of the gate that there is a lot of um debate in the in the historical field of just how much we could say about um Attil of the Hun's early life. Yeah, I mean over that period between him and Chingas, like, there was a lot more record keeping. Two. Right, that's a that's a great point. We don't even know what language the Huns spoke necessarily, No, we debate on that. No idea um. Apparently, one of the things you can kind of glean what language people spoke is UM from their names, and a lot of the names associated with Attila, the Hunt and the Huns in general are Germanic, so they say, well, they spoke Germanic. The other people say well no. By the time until of the Hun came around in the fifth century UM, the Germanic tongue had spread far and wide, so that's probably not what their native tongue originally was. It's just lost the time. One of the reasons it was lost the time is because these were, in the parliance of the day, total barbarians. They were nomadic horse people who lacked virtually any anything resembling a government, um, anything like an economy, anything like the trappings of what you would call a civilization. They were by definition barbarians, right, But all that aside, it's not to say that that that civilization is just everything's perfect. Definitely has its own flaws, and barbarianism has its own amazements, right. But the thing that made the Huns definitive barbarians is because they would come through sack your town, burn it down, kill you and your family, and then just move on. They would take your gold. They had no desire to subjugate you, to to rule you, to extract taxes, to maybe make you grow crops for them. Nothing. It was basically pillaging, raping, and murdering is what the Huns were known for, because that's what they did. Yeah, and I think the main difference that I found, well, plenty of differences, but the main one between he and Khan was sort of, like you said, like Genghis, Khan wanted to rule the world and spread his empire as as ruler of people's and Attila the Hun, by all accounts, wanted to collect gold right um, but was also for all his ferocity. There are also scholars and historians who believe that uh Man I might get these names mixed up. Now that I'm all in my head about it, I'm I've been just hanging on by my fingernail. There are a lot of scholars and historians who believe that until of the hun Is was also uh sort of a fair person and generally a man of his word, and maybe rustled up a lot of these stories to drive himself to drive fear into his enemies, and was not as brutal as maybe history believes in some cases. Yeah, but I I so. You remember when we did the chinaskon episode, like, there was a lot of um, a lot of examples and things you could point to and be like they improved the world in these ways. There you can count the ones about until of the hun like basically on your fingers, and when when it was an example of him being like uncharacteristically magnanimous by sparing somebody's life, it was totally out of character for him, and like, um. One of the things about Chengiz Khan as well is that if you surrendered without a fight, if you just said, we surrender, take our town, you would live. And you would live now under the rule of the Mongols the till of the Hun he and the Huns would kill you, kill your whole town. Offering no resistance whatsoever, did not guarantee in any way, shape or form survival when you encountered the Hunts. They terrified people for hundreds of years in Europe. But at the same time, if you paid your your uh what what do you call it, like the gangster movies tribute? Yeah, but like you know when you pay someone to protect your money, Yeah, sort of like that, Yeah, protection from you. Basically, Uh, generally, and again there are examples even in this article of ours where he he went back on that. But generally if you paid that gold, he would also leave you alone. Um, because he didn't want to lose. Like I said, he wasn't trying to just conquer the world. So he seemed like he would only undertake a mission or a or a war if he if there was something in it for him other than just like expanding his kingdom, which on a modern map eventually was it say here large portions of eastern and western Roman Empires, from Germany in the west, to Romania in the south, to the Netherlands and the north, and Russia and Kazakhstan in the east. And uh, that was generally a till of the Huns area over about a ten year span, well nine I think nine years, well nineteen years period. But in that ten year span is when he really liked did a lot of his damage, which is that's impressive, and put a big dent in the Roman Empire. That was another thing too, Like you can you can say what you want about the guy, and I think it's worth pointing out there's all of this is to say, like nobody is bad. And when you get this far are away, almost two thousand years away, years away from somebody like, their character just becomes cartoonish. So there is not a lot we can say, especially about the nuances of this guy's character, but you can point to what he did and say, this man change the course of history, and he definitely did, especially by basically hastening the fall of the Roman Empire. Right, this is pretty impressive stuff. I feel like we should almost stick a break. That was a nice preamble. All right, we'll get back to his birth and start over right after this. Alright, So four oh sixes when they think Attila the Hunt was born in uh Pannonia, which what you would now say is Hungary. Yeah, because by this time the Hunts, well they first appear in the Western record, and I think ce Tacitus, the historian Roman historian says, oh, yeah, by the way, there's these people out there called the Hunts. There are barbarian tribe who cares watch you're back. Well, he didn't even say that. He just basically said there's a barbarian tribe out there. But by the time Attila was was born, the Hunts had made a name for themselves is being fierce, fearsome warriors that just basically could overtake anybody, and they had. Yeah, he was not born. His story is very different from Chingis Khans, and that he was born already into I guess what you would consider royalty, uh and and privilege. And that they think the Huns came from Kazakhstan, I think you said, or their their empire stretched all the way kash Central Asia. They think that's where they probably originated. But by the time Untila was born, Um, he was born on the Danube in Hungary, which is like became the capital of the area they settled. Yeah, and you mentioned that the Huns were known as fierce warriors. Um, much like Khan's army. They really made their hay on horses. I don't even know if that counts as a pun, It doesn't, all right, It was just delightful though. They were excellent horsemen. UM. I don't know if they rode those little squatty horses like uh, like Khan's army did. But they were great on horseback, apparently so great that they kind of didn't get off their horses to do much when it when in terms of battle. But even beyond battle. I saw that they held negotiations on their horses. Um that they were characterized as being one with their horse. That was one thing, right, right, in the true sense that was I hope not mainly for the horses, say yeah, but um they they they were. The fact that they were amazing horsemen. That's check one, and why they were basically impossible to feat Check two was they had a special kind of bow called the hun bow, right, and these things are beautiful. It was a recursive bow where the bow itself been curve back onto itself, which meant you have more torque, which meant you could shoot an arrow through armor at a hundred yards. Yeah, they're all kinds of recurve bows, but this one was especially squatty and kind of short. So it's recurved. It's not recursive, yeah recurve. Um. Oh yeah, it was short, which meant it was mobile. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So if you picture just like a U shaped bow, that's just a bow, but a recurve bends back around to face the other way at both ends and both points. And this one was, like I said, especially squatty, and it just it's cool looking like bow enthusiasts collect these things. I can imagine hun bows. You say, this is a till of the huns areo boat. Everybody says that. So so wait a minute, So we've got two things. Now we've got they were basically one with their horse. They were so good on a horse, they could shoot arrows through your armor a hundred yards away, almost a hundred meters away. Um, while on these horses. That's check two. And then number three is that they didn't fight in any sort of coherent battle formation. It was just show up out of nowhere, right around, start picking people off, scatter, regroup out of nowhere, show up again, pick more people off, scatter, regroup and like you just you had no idea that they were coming at any point in time, and they would just come and basically waste your army. And there was no formation that you could form against. It was just chaos. Yeah, and and fast, like before you knew what was going on, You're you're getting arrows slung your way. And like you said, from any direction, wasn't like here they come from the north, Like they were all over the place. Uh. It said here in this one article you sent that the soldiers they wore these heavy leather greased uh outfits greased with animal fat, which is good, which just said made them both supple and rain resistant. Maybe that was for the horses and steel line helmets chain mail. They're very nimble. They also used swords, of course, and their leather boots. They rode horses so much they didn't even worry about hiking, so they would wear these leather boots. Had very thin soles that I guess major feet, more responsive to stirrup action. I don't know, they were just more comfortable. They're like, isoton boots? Did they make shoes? Oh? No, you're talking about the gloves. They make slippers? I think, Oh really, I think so. I don't think it was Damn Marina, want to hear that isotoneer gloves and uh ace ventura. All right, So these are the huns. They're nomadic there chaotic and battle, their fierce, Their their stories precede them, their legend precedes them. So when you are getting attacked like that's got to do a mental number on you, especially like when they came upon towns and cities, like sometimes entire cities, they would level them, just utterly destroy They would take everything they wanted kill everybody that they wanted. They would take hostages and slaves and prisoners, um. But then they would just destroy the town. And there was one town in Italy um called Aquileia. Aquileia, I believe um. No one knows where it was, they know it existed, but then the Huns got They Huns sacked it and now no one has any idea what it was because they just utterly destroyed the tip. That was like the kind of thing they would do, almost just out of spite, just maliciously, you know, because apparently Attila the Hun was known for um using his fierce reputation at an advantage and he didn't want to fight or thought that fighting was unwise. He could use his reputation to get you to to surrender and then maybe you would survive, maybe you wouldn't. UM. But they didn't necessarily need that because they backed up the fierce reputation actually did these things that people feared them for. And they had a name for the Huns, and apparently specifically Attila the Hun in the Holy Roman or the Roman Empires pre Holy Roman, they called them the flagellum day the scourge of God. And this is what these Christians thought, that that God had sent this horrible, almost devil figure to come and wipe their towns from the earth because they weren't living upright enough. Yeah, and I saw some historians think that he might have even made that name up. Oh really, it seems like he was a big promoter of his of his wicked ways, just to scare people. Well, it's still working on me, like he would because I'm passing all this stuff off. He was often drawn with like goats horns and things like that, And I don't I think he encouraged this stuff. Well, he did famously say that wherever he's trod or past, grass will never grow again. So yeah, he definitely, he definitely would play it up. But it didn't hurt his feelings that people said these things about him, right, so he I don't think we mentioned yet. He uh took over along with his brother Blada b L E. D A when they were young their uncles actually, um, that's there was a lot of biarchy going on at the time with the Huns, which is a little bit unusual for a couple of people to split ruling duties, and their uncles jointly ruled the Hunt empire. Eventually the brothers took over as co rulers in four thirty four, and I think they even had their own territories that they were in charge of. It's not like they were together. Uh. And then eventually Attila was like, yeah, I think I'd rather just really operate this show by myself. And he killed his brother, killed his own brother. That's that's harsh. I didn't see. How did you see? I didn't. I couldn't find it. I couldn't either, as I saw once a story about a night I think, who killed his own brother. But his brother was a priest saying mass, and the night came in and cut his own brother's head off while he was saying mass. Like, if there is a god, that really upset I'm unsure. So he and his brother uh co rule and they settled down a little bit on the great what was known as the Great Hungarian Plains, a little less nomadic at this point were the Huns. Yeah, because they were weighed down with so much golden plunder. Yeah, they just they couldn't ride around like they did. So have we reached the point where he's the single ruler? Now, yeah, let's go ahead and get rid of his brother, so we should a. I don't know if this name came upon him ascending to um being the co ruler with his brother or the single ruler. But Attila means little father. They do not think that this is his birth name, because that's just no matter what age or period of history we're talking about, it'd be weird to name your son little father. Um. They think it was a name of respect and affection, is how I saw it put and that they think that this was basically his His king name was Attila. They have no idea what his real name was, but they think that Attila was not it. No, but by the time he became ruler, like you said, he was born into a privileged household. Um, he he knew what to do from a very early age. His uncle's as rulers brought him and his brother Bleda up to speak Latin. So maybe he did come up with Flagellum Davey Goth which was another Germanic tribe who figure into this picture later on. Um and to to understand diplomacy, military strategy, horsemanship obviously, UM all of this stuff. So it was brought up to lead, so it was kind of natural that he would kill his brother and take over the entire hunt empire. Yeah, and the other another thing I thought was interesting was even though he was sort of on a conquest for gold and riches, he lived sort of simply as a ruler. Like all of his his upper uh subordinates. Apparently they did live the high life, and they drank from silver and gold chalices and had fancy clothes and big you know, make mansions, platform shoes, platform shoes with goldfish in the heel. And Attila lived in a log house with animal skins on the walls and drank from a wooden cup. And even though he wanted to get all this gold, it doesn't look like he lived that way, which is pretty interesting. Yeah. That really kind of opens up the guy for interpretation. You know, like says a couple of things. One, he's surrounded by all these material goods, but his tastes are extraordinarily simple, and he stuck to it. He didn't try to show off at any point. He just was who he was as far as his taste point. And then secondly, he also didn't demand that the people subordinate to him live like he lived. That says an enormous amount you know, like, there's so many people at the top who want the people below them to act like them, to live like them, to behave like them. So for him to to have like there was a cult of personality around this guy, and for him to allow and maybe even encourage people to live their own way totally counter to how he lived. I don't know. He's a complex figure for sure. Um. Should we talk about the Treaty of Marcus. Yeah, this is a big turning point in history. Yeah. So this was in four thirty four. Uh, and he I believe that what we're going back to when Bledah was still alive. Um, they worked up a peace treaty called the Treaty of Marcus with what is this the Eastern Roman Empire. Yes, and they basically said, hey, if you return all these hunt refugees, basically people that fled my rule, return these people to us. How many were there? At least of fourteen, but I think maybe seventeen Yeah, like not seventeen thousand, but seventeen people. But that's how much he prized loyalty, is how I saw it. Put. Yeah, like I want these people back, and he also didn't want them going off into the Roman Empire and stirring up rebellion to come take over the Hunting Empire. Yeah, exactly. So if you return, these people will establish some trading rights that are fair. You guys pay us about seven hundred pounds of gold every year directly to me and my bro and we'll, like, we'll lay off and you can just kind of do your thing here in the Eastern Roman Empire. Yeah, it's extortion. Yeah, I saw that that Attila was. He plundered in war and extorted in peacetime. That's what he did. So yeah, he said, we won't invade you if you pay a seven hundred pounds of goal of a year, and he didn't. But then he said, um, there was another part of this too. He said that that he wanted not just the traitorous Huns who left or escaped his rule to be returned to him. He also wanted um, a Roman bishop who he believed had come into the Hunting Empire and desecrated some graves and stolen grave goods from the graves, to be handed over to him. And apparently the Eastern Empire uh Emperor Theodosius the second said, hey, man I gave, I gave all of the Huns I could find in the empire over to you and this bishop. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't think this is actually true. Um, they didn't give over the bishop. And so Attila actually said, um, you guys just broke the treaty, were invading, And he did invade, and they actually invaded through Marguts. And the guy who opened the gates of Marguts too for them to the Huns was the bishop who stole the grave goods. So had the emperor handed over this guy, the the invasion of Italy by the Huns would have never happened. And that's the sound that played when he opened the gate. Apparently they got within about twenty miles of Constantinople. And Theodosius too said, whoa, you're getting a little too close. How about pounds of gold per year three times as much cold? And I believe that that quelled Attila's desires for temporarily, at least temporarily. So that just meant with Attila that he just turned his sight somewhere else. Yeah, you want to take a break, Yeah, let's do it. Okay, okay, man, we're back. So, um, the Eastern Roman Empire has said all right, here here take some more gold. Um leave us alone, and he did for a little while. But one of the things that um Attila the hunt did was he created like a domino effect, there were other Germanic tribes of barbarians and making air quotes everybody um who were in the area that got pushed out of the area and into the Roman Empire by the Hunts. So the Hunts pushed out the Allan's, the Alan's pushed out the Goths. The Goths pushed out some other tribes, and as a result, you now had other Germanic tribes living in the Roman Empire. It's a big seed that got planted by the Hunts because the Hunts pushed everybody out and took over their empire. Right, This actually led to the downfall of the Roman Empire later on. It was that the Great migration, yeah, or the wandering of the nations. Now is this when people split and just fractured the Roman Empire, So hopefully get that. So what happened was the um the these different tribes got pushed into the Roman Empire started and the Vandals that so um, the the Visigoths in particular got pushed into there and they were living as Roman subjects under Roman rule, but they were not being treated very well by the Roman governors of the territories they lived in. And they eventually rose up against Rome, against a Roman empire in the areas where they lived. And these little battles and skirmishes that that that Rome was having, or the Roman Empire was having with these groups that would have otherwise not been in their borders started to weaken the empire enough that it actually felt the the I think it was the Goths that actually sacked Rome and and crumbled the Roman Empire. And the whole reason they could make it to Rome was because they were in the Roman Empire already, because the Huns had pushed them in their years before and set off this chain of events that led to maybe the most powerful empire in the history of the world. Tell of the Hun did that? It wasn't Susie in her banshees no leading the Goths. Did you like them? Oh? Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, me too, they were great. I generally wasn't into that, though, yes, I don't even know what counts. She You didn't like the cure or the smiths, or I guess the smiths weren't weren't goth, but the cure definitely was. You don't like the cure. I love the cure, but chuck your golf. Really, my friend, you're GoF all right, I'll get my mass era. Okay, uh yeah, I mean some of those terms, I don't even know, like what the dividing line is. I don't you know. You know, people are still hung up on that kind of thing. Do you like the cure? Yes? Good, you're smart for liking the cure. They're great and you're a god. Should we talk about his weird marriage situation? Yes, so this was odd. He had well, obviously he had a bunch of wives, because that's just the way it was back then. No one knows how many wives. I don't think it's like anything like Chingis Khan, where they think he fathered like half the world's uh people or anything like that. But he had a share of wives. And this was an interesting thing. Here. In the spring of fourteen fifty, there was a woman named Honorrhea, and she was the sister of uh Valentinian, the third Emperor of Western Room. He was trying to marry her off to an aristocrat, as you do, like you're my sister here, take this husband out of my hair. I'm sorready hearing about it. Uh. And she was like, I don't really like this guy who you're trying to hook me up with, so I'm gonna do a weird thing. He's got no hair growing out of his nose, and he's like everybody has hair growing out of their nose. It's the fifth century. Uh. So she sends her engagement ring to Attila, said, Hey, I don't want to marry this guy. Can you help me out? This is a very bizarre act. It's a bizarre act because Attila basically sees this as, oh, she wants to marry me because I've got this little wedding ring. Now I put on my pinky toe and uh, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go claim this bride. And I also want half of your empire as dowry, half of the Western Roman empire. He demanded his dowry, and he was coming to get Did you call her Honoria? And it seems to me like a Noria was kind of like immediately like, what, yeah, I didn't really I didn't What I didn't? How is this woman not more famous? I don't know like, what a blunder it This is a crazy blunder that led to a huge sacking of Rome. And why, Like, I feel like there's part of the story missing. Why wet out to Antille of the Hunt. From what I saw, there was no they'd never met before. There was no interaction whatsoever. She just basically said, here, servant, take this ring to Attil of the Hunt. I don't know where he is, go find him. He wasn't like met her years ago and it's like, Hey, if you need remember me from high school, give me a call. I'll sack whatever needs sacking. None of that happened. From what I understand, I guess this dude was just the baddest, fiercest guy that a Noria could think of, and she said help. She really really made a missed up and including the engagement ring or maybe even reaching out at all. But the engagement ring was it gave at Till of the Hun just enough entree to say, oh, this is this is a pretty good reason to to invade the Western Roman Empire, which he did. That's right, looking for an Aria and that was the pretense. Yeah, but on his way he took another wife, uh name Bildico I think so, all right, And on their wedding night he actually died. He was not known, especially for the time, to be like a great like drinker. I mean, he wasn't a teetotal or no, but he was very moderate, temperate person as far as that stuff goes. Yeah, for the most part, he wasn't like the rest of the Huns that were just you know, getting wasted everything, or the rest of the Western Roman or Eastern Roman Empire like. But he was basically the one large area ruler who wasn't like just getting wasted and eating like five turkey legs at a time. Right, he was different in that sense for sure. Yeah, he was the only one that didn't have gout. Yeah, I guess as far as I know. Uh, so he marries this lady. Apparently he did drink a little bit too much on his wedding night and supposedly was prone to nose bleeds, and as the story goes, in the middle of the night, had some sort of massive nosebleed, also saw something about an artery bursting, uh and choked on his blood in his sleep and died. Yeah, that's supposedly how I tell of the Hun died. Weird story, but believable, I guess. For yeah, I mean, the alternative explanation is that Il Deco murdered him or um abedded an assassination um that was carried out by I think one of the one either the Eastern or Western Roman emperors. Either way, like they think I said, I got the impression that that's the generally accepted ideas that he choked on his own blood. He basically died out of natural causes, which I mean, it's like, Gosh, you overindulge one night and you pay for it with your life, you know. But throughout throughout his reign we left out a huge chunk of of his history. At some point he turned his attention to Gaul France modern day France Belgium area, and that's where he suffered as one defeat. So out of the entire nineteen years, this guy was running around Eurasia terrorizing it. Um he suffered one defeat, and even then it was really a draw. But he uh, he attacked Gaul and I think troops and the Western Roman emperor got with the Goths and said, you guys, we gotta do something about this, and they managed to basically enter into a draw with the Huns, so much so that the Huns had to withdraw to their camp and eventually left Gaul after this, but it was supposedly one of the bloodiest battles in the history of of the world. Yeah, they managed to fight him back after and this is after the beginning was definitely going in the favor of the Huns. Uh, So it looked like the riding was on the wall and that was that was a big comeback. But imagine basically spending every day of your life engaged in conquest, in battle and you got one lost to your name. Yeah, you gotta have one. Everybody's got to have the ups with the downs, right. Yeah. Well, let's talk about his his his burial after his death. Yeah, this is pretty interesting. After he died, his his horsemen, his followers, they cut off their hair, they smeared blood all over their face, and they slowly circled him on their horses. Um, I guess just I don't know if that was a uh sign of respect that normally happens, or if they were just reacting instinctively, or if it was some old ritual, But at any rate, they just slowly rode around his body that was the tent. Eventually he went in three coffins. Yeah, which makes me think that he could still be found, Yes, because he was in a coffin of gold, silver and iron, apparently, like, ah, was it a Matrushka nesk? I don't know, Matroishka. What is that? You know? The little Russian dolls that nest inside one another Russian nesting dolls. Let's just call him that. Yeah, I didn't know they had to. I think it's Maroika. Yeah, I think so. I love those. And show me a child that's not delighted by one of those, yeah, little things inside of other things. Show you a dollard. Uh. So they put him in three coffins. According to legend, they divert a river um like fully damn up a river and bury him in the river bed and then release the river once again, so that his grave would never be found. They also killed the people who buried him so that they couldn't tell anybody who were slaves. So there's there's actually so that sounds like a total like Paul Bunyan esque tall tale. Right, there's actually historical evidence that this had been done at least two other times. The emperor Gilgamesh, you know, the Epic of Gilgamesh. They believed that they found his resting place under the Euphrates, and legend has it that they diverted the Euphrates to bury him in the river bed for the same exact reason. They think they've actually found gilgamesh Is burying place. And then um, I think the Doocious the first Yeah, the Goth king who was killed in one of those battles in Gaul, the one that that repelled Um until of the hunt. Um kind of he was buried in a diverted river as well. So they're saying like they think this actually may have happened, which means that you if you search bet it was the Danube that they buried him in. But if you search a river, I would I would start with the Danube because that's where the capital of the Huns was. Could they divert the Danube? Though I don't know, maybe a part of it. Who knows that that maybe one day a till of the huns um grave will be found, especially as archaeological technology advances. I guarantee you in fifty years we're going to have found Until of the Huns gray Man, and it will be under a riverbed in three coffins. Yes, I really think that that's for real. I believe it. Believe it. Oh wait, you said you did? Ah, you go anything else? No, I mean that which there's a lot of the till of the hun stuff that we did not get to. Can I add one more thing? I want to defend my use of barbarian one of the I think contemporary historians described the Huns as not making no use of fire. They even use fire. Supposedly they didn't cook their food. They would eat roots from the ground and then raw meat that they would put between their thighs in the saddle to tenderize it, I guess, and then they would eat that. They're barbarians. Okay, I saw that article. It said, uh, something like half raw, and they said, we say half raw because they would hold it between their thighs to cook it. Yeah, you got some beef thighs there. You got some red stained thighs. That sounds like, uh, I don't need what that sounds like on the menu something it's been cooked from the thighs of a hun. Right, It's kind of like it's one hipster step above su vied cooking. Really, if you think about. Okay, now we're done. Nothing like the warm glow of a hunt testicle against the stake it man, Oh boy, who's going on the rails here? Yeah? So if you want to know more about the huns, you can type that word in the search bar how stuff works dot com. And since I said that, it's time for a listener maw, I'm gonna call this follow up to we got a surprising amount of email from that goofy show we did on the Jobs. Yeah, I know, it's like a high, high volume episode. Yeah, I was surprised. You never know. Uh. And by the way, we had a lot of people right in and say, by the way, there is still chariot racing. It's called harness racing pin setters, and I take issue with that. Harness racing is harness racing. Those are not chariots. Oh yeah, okay, what if I gets the same thing. There are pin setters and lamp lighters too. Basically, it was a fraudulent episode. Now I'm with you. Harness racing is not cherry. Like standing up in a in a wooden box being pulled by eight horses is not the same thing as a harness race. I've been to a harness race. I have to. My dad used to take us to those, let us bet like a dollar on him. I don't think I ever won, Yeah, which is probably good for my gambling bug. It never took off at a young age. Yeah, just the skittles and poker. Yeah. I'm not a big gamper either. Uh okay, alright, So anyway, this is about lamp lighters. This from Carlos in Mexico. Hey, guys, have found the stuff you talk about about lamp lighting fascinating. Like to add some extra info, Back in the day, people used to tip and or threaten the lamplighters to leave the lamp near a park bench or something turned off so couples could have more privacy. You know what I'm saying, Like, Hey, don't like that lamp. I gotta cure some meat over here, you know, the hunway. In fact, there is a Spanish folk song by the Cherumbellas suggestion on how to pronounce it h jerum bellas. Is it a d J? It's a c H pronounced like a ju. He says jerom Bellas about a lamp lighter being harassed by couples every night to leave the lamp off. The chorus loosely translates as follows, lamp lighter, go a little over there and leave this lamp off. In love affairs the lamp, the light of lamp always gets in the way. And this song is from the song Farrelero by the Chambarillas. How about that. I think you made it through quite nicely. Uh. And this is from Carlos from Guadalajara, and he also wants to suggest a topic, how capture work? Oh nice? Did we not cover that? No, we could do a whole one on like caption the Turing test and all that would be cool because capture stands for something, right, stands for computer automated pap tests PEP, something test to tell computers and humans apart. And now that's the end. Yeah. Maybe I think we did something about that on our dump TV show. That's what it was. You're absolutely right, yeah, uh yeah.
