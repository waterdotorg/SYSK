Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuffworks dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's no which makes us a very special edition of Stuff you Should Know, harrier than Jerry. Yeah, edition much harrier. No, let's see your hair man that has a lot of hair hairsuite. He's like the original Kings of Leon. I used to love those guys back when they were like Tennessee hill Billy's. Yeah, and then they got their glam makeover and I was like, it's like Metallica after the Black album. Yeah, what happened? What happened Metallica Lars. I think they enjoyed making loads of money, truckloads of money. Didn't think more than being like heavy metal parking lot guys. Yeah exactly. Um, hey Chuck. Before we get started, we want to tell everybody you can follow us on Twitter. That's why sk podcast. You can hang out with us on Facebook, dot com, slash stuff. You should know our YouTube channel search Josh and Chuck. It's pretty awesome, and as always we have a wonderful website. Stuff you Should Know dot com. That's right, you can hang out with us outside of the podcast if you want, if you want, no pressure. So how are you doing? I'm great. I'm super excited about this topic because A we're pairing it with our Charles Darwin show, Yeah, which I guess came out last episode, right, aren't we pairing the two? Yeah? I think we're doing Darwin first. Let's do Darwin first, because I think in the Darwin episode we say we should do natural selection. It's here we are. But I'm just excited because to me, and I gushed a little at Darwin's feet, this is my own personal statement. I think natural selection is the most exciting and like beautiful thing that exists. It's it's just it really turns my crank. You know, you're like an old timey car. Yeah, yeah, you know. I grew up this is again my personal story. I grew up in churches most listeners now, uh, which was heavy doses of of creation, the creation story. And I remember, as a kid, even fully involved in in church, thinking like I just this doesn't make sense to me. I just it didn't add up. So natural selection it just makes sense to you. Yeah. When I finally learned about natural selection, like really really understood and learned it. It just it made total sense because I can like see it, it was tangible. I could make sense of it. And again that's my own story. We don't poo poo anyone or saying anyone should feel anyway, but we just explain how things work exactly. You know. But I have a personal attachment to this just because I think it's like the grooviest thing going. Yeah, no, I know what you mean. Like it it makes uttering complete sense. It's almost um in capable of being appropriated to serve some agenda. It just is what it is, you know, It's just there. It's beautiful. I agree with you entirely. It's an elegant theory. Its just super neat. Yeah. Um. And the wonderful thing is is like there's even squabbles in the scientific community over exactly how evolution works and processes, and regardless, everyone's still like, yep, natural selection pretty much perfect. Yeah, it just makes sense. I'm gonna have a t shirt natural selection. It just makes sense. I have a feeling we'll be getting an email with something like that eventually, So let's talk about natural selection. I think a lot of people, including myself, um, kind of had an idea of what it was, pretty good idea, but not necessarily understanding the ins and outs of it. And well, that's what we're here for, is to explain the ins and outs of natural selection. So, um, basically, a lot of people interchange evolution and natural selection. That's incorrect. Um. Evolution is this huge process by which species adapt and change to survive in their environments, and the way that that moves along. The mechanism that drives that is natural selection. So they're not one and the same. Natural selection drives evolution. Yeah, and who wrote this one? Was this? Uh? Grabowski? The grabster I should have known. Uh, just very simply puts it very early on the article. Organisms best suited to survive in their particular circumstance have a greater chance of passing their traits onto the next generation. That's right, it just makes sense. I'm gonna try not to say that every ten minutes, but just now that that's going on in my head. Yeah, and and and um do you want that on a T shirt? And natural selection is like it's this ongoing, basically never ending process even when organisms really kind of seemingly stopped developing, like they figured it out. Yeah, but it's it isn't. It doesn't have its own sentience. It isn't its own thing. Like you can't. You can't attribute it to some sort of creator or creation necessarily unless you believe that kind of thing. But like if you're if you, it's very easy to give it a personality, but it's not. It's the byproduct of how organisms exist, and we exist by our genes and by the fact that those genes change frequently within the lifetime of a person thanks to what we understand now is of the genetics, but also through reproduction. And from these these moments, these periods where genes are up for a change, they can completely or even just partially change part of an organism, and that change may or may not help the organism survive in the environment, like you just quoted Grabanowski. And if it does, bay a natural selection will root that out and it will propagate that. Yeah, and uh. It also points out Darwin um he did coin term natural selection and survival of the fittest. And I do think that many people hear survival of the fittest and they think of the lion eating the gazelle. But it's also, like he says, the tree that can disperse its seed where it needs to for those seeds to grow or the bacteria that uh survives. It's not you know, animal eating animal, although it can, right, And so since we're on it, Chuck, fitness is basically um like you say, like a tree's ability to spread seeds and for those seeds to take rud because its grabs. Her points out, it's not enough for a tree to produce a bunch of seeds, which is its ability to reproduce, Yeah, and its ability to survive long enough to even get to the point to it where it reproduces. Right. That's step one is to live long enough to be able to reproduce. Step two, or the second part of it is that that reproduction is as successful as it possibly can be. Yeah, Like it says, not only you gotta do it, you gotta do it well. So that tree, it spreads tons and tons of seeds. If those seeds um happen to um catch fire and sunlight, that's not going to be a very good trait. But if they have like a really hard husk that can survive the elements but then disintegrates when it's digested by a raccoon and then pooped out. You know, then all of a sudden you've got that step two covered. Yeah, or if it you know, if it's just dumb luck, if that tree exists in a place where it's super windy and can disperse the seeds better, uh, then it will propagate. If not, then you may not even know that that tree existed exactly unless you consult the fossil record. That's right. Um, Okay, So I guess the whole point to natural selection is that it is an agent of change, but it's also a byproduct of change, and we kind of have to take a step backward to figure out where this change is happening. I already said it a little bit, but it's in it's our DNA. It's in the DNA of all living things to change. Yeah, well, traits were all born with traits, and we inherent those traits from you know who who made us our folks and um. But it's not necessarily that's not necessarily natural selection at work over like one generation to the next. Right, there can be differences in traits. Like Darwin, as we'll see, points that out himself. He's like, let's just get it out of the way, Like just because you have brown eyes and somebody else has blue eyes, that's not evolution. No, and he uses a good example here of tall versus short folks. Uh, tall people might be basketball players, people might be jockeyscus the grabs are not Darwin. Yeah yeah, yeah, Um did they have basketball? When was that advented? When did the name sent in mid basketball? I want to say eighteen forty eight, but it's probably eighteen seventy, not too far off. So he makes the point that you know, if something happened to where like jockeys could reproduce better or basketball players could not reproduce anymore. Yeah, I was trying to imagine, just make up anything, I know, I was trying to and like I couldn't come up with it. Well, just make make up something like being able to uh dribble and dunk lowers your sperm count. Oh that's a good one. See, that's what I'm saying. I think my brain was in understand natural selection modes of my My imagination grew less fertile, so it didn't survive, No, it didn't. Um, And over time, basically basketball players don't reproduce as much jockey's do, and over several generations, people are going to be shorter on average. It sounds almost dumb, it's so simple, but that's really the basis of it. It is, and it's one of those things. It's like economics where it's so simple that it's hard to wrap your mind around it because you make it more complex necessarily than it is. It's it's very similar for me. Um. And with that basketball example which just happened, was humanity evolved to be shorter. That was the end result. And that evolution took place because there was a shift in the distribution of traits. So before lots of basketball players, lots of jockeys, tallness and shortness, which are traits or variations on the trade of height in humans, Like we have height, we're not too dimensional inherited by who bore you, right, not us, your parents. We bore you in a different way. Um. So the variations on the trade eventually gave rise to evolution. So within just like our generation or even a couple of generations, the differences in eye color, height or something like that, it doesn't represent evolution, but changes like that can lead to evolution over time. Yeah, if they are changes that either aid or prevent your survival, right, Like if something happens and all of a sudden human women were all like, we're not gonna mate with anybody but blue eyes. You can bet your bippy that within two generations there's gonna be nothing but blue eyed kids. Yeah, or grown adults getting blue contacts. That's a good idea because they're tired of not having sex. But then maybe our eyes would adapt to um the context and just absorb them. Something has to happen. Your imagination is plenty fertill, my friend, I guess so. Uh, and this all goes back if we can go back a little further to something called DNA um that is a chemical structure that is the basis for everything that is. Is that a good way to say it? And Uh? Within DNA are sequences of traits, sets of traits, and those are the genes. And then there's something called the LLL, which is really where it all comes together. Is it all? Or allele? Does I say ll adele? No? Adele allele? Okay? So it's like a gene is like a specific sequence of DNA that produces some trade. So height, like you have a height gene like and when that gene is working like you will grow. Yeah, the expression of the gene is the allele. Yeah, that's the variation of that trait. So imagine like as just a stretch of genes is like a few boxes, say five of them, and three are off the three that will encode to make brown eyes, uh, and two are on the two that will encode to make blue eyes. So each one's an allele, but the one that's functioning gives you blue eyes. So in allal is just a variation on a trade. And a trade is produced by a gene, which is a sequence of DNA. That variation is produced by an allele, which is a sequence of the gene. And how often that allele shows up in a population is the allele frequency. And it's really simple. You hear alleal frequency and it sounds like, oh that's science, but it's really pretty easy. That's what they go to school force to learn the jargon. Yeah, and uh, we did a really good episode on population and uh, we're gonna be talking about here again though, So we should just say that a population is a group uh in one place that have sex with each other. Yeah. Um, so like a zebra in Africa. He makes up he should have used real examples because he said, let's say there were zebras in South America. But I see his point, that would be a different population because they can't have sex with the zebras in Africa, because zebras can't swim across the ocean. And a lion in Africa is in a different population than a zebra in Africa because they don't do it right. They can't. It's an abomination. It is. You come up with a zion, that'd be kind of cool. I guess, sort of like a tiger. Probably maybe that's what a tiger. I think. It's So you were talking about populations and you're in a little frequency. So, um, you could conceivably quantify the alleal frequency of blue eyes and the human population because we transcended, like the difference between Africa and South America. Like we have planes now, so we we all have access to sex with one another as a population, as long as you have a passport and some money for a plane ticket. Um. So speaking about a lieal frequency, Um, the point of that whole thing is that with evolution, I guess another way to put it, the way it grabs or puts it is evolution is just a shift or a change in alleal frequency. And the reason that that change takes places because those alleles that become more and more widespread and distributed it across the population, UM have made that organism more likely to survive, to reproduce, and more likely to successfully reproduce. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's the evolution driven by natural selection. Do you want to quit? I don't think we could top at this point. Now it does get more interesting. Um Alile's create are created in a few different ways. UM. One is called a mutation, which you probably heard of. Uh. These are random changes. Uh. They are pretty rare, like the X men. Yeah, very rare, very rare mutants are. That's why they got to hang out with the president a lot. Yeah, but the president was also a mutant, wouldn't he. Oh yeah, eventually Kelsey Grammer. No, no, no, the president was the guy with the son with the wings. I thought, ye, his son was the mutant and the president the president. But I think Kelsey Grammer eventually was elected president Blue president, Blue Harry President. So to me, the cool thing about mutations is is they can be completely new traits that are introduced that are completely different than anything you've ever seen in that species, which is pretty radical. Another way is just like we've been talking about sex a lot reproduction just with animals humans. That is the way that an aile can express itself. Right. It's the mixing together when when your mom and your dad love each other very much and they copulate. Um, there sperm and egg mixed together, break down their DNA and it's glorious, fantastic um little mini explosion inside the womb and uh, and then it really it recombines into a totally new form that shares part of the dad's DNA and part of the mom's UNICH to make a new human. Yeah, and you get all the bad traits from each of them, right, hopefully you get all the best traits. But that's the point of sexual reproduction, which was itself naturally selected, because it increases the potential that you're going to inherit uh, good traits that will let you survive. That's right, there's just more traits out there. It's like um. I think it was the Sense of Smell episode we did where we talked about pheromones, the idea that pheromones among humans, we we can still detect them even though we don't know it. And the whole reason we can is to smell out other people's immune system and we want somebody with an opposite immune system of RS. So when you put the two together, it produces a little mini superhuman who can't be killed. There was an interesting study I think where they just had people smelling things, but the gauging attraction levels right. But it's based on the premise of sexual reproduction, which is the combining as many good traits as possible make somebody with a lot of them. Uh. And then the final way that um alile's are created is um genetic recombination, and that would be in the case of like a bacteria who obviously don't go out and have sex with each other um, but they do absorb DNA that they get from other bacteria and basically make it part of them. Yeah, they think that's where the ukaryotes came from. Yeah, the mitochondria was its own thing and it became absorbed by some ancient cell to serve as like the power center of the of the cell, and from that like gave rise to everything with the backbone, everything that's not a bacteria basically, so fish at first, I guess yeah, but eventually, like it all, it all just came to that and it's still going on today. It's just two organisms in one neat yeah that's super neat, and then one other thing. Like there are three ways that this could happen. That um that new alliles could be introduced. But um, I wonder if epigenetics will eventually be added to that. Yeah, because think about it. I mean, it's a change in gene expression, right, So yeah, I could see that leading to I guess I guess it could be classified as a spontaneous mutation. I guess it would fall under that umbrella. Yeah, but so much leads up to it. I don't know. I'm with you. What's out of fourth? Okay, et the genetics is officially added as a change to Allele's I'm sure we'll get an email from someone that's super smart that will explain exactly why that won't happen there. Like, first of all, Chuck was right, it's allows so Chuck we um. You know we said that all of this starts at DNA and the fact that it changes, we actually should go back even further, um than that, uh, into the backdrop of nature, the environment, the reason that DNA changes, that traits change over time is because of a little thing called death. Yeah, we all die and how to avoid it exactly. It's it's the combination of the two things. We're all going to die, and all organisms appear to be driven by a desire to put off that moment as long as possible, So we have an instinct to survive. Right. The problem is is the processes of nature are trying to put us down all the time, so there is a inherent struggle to survive. So when you combine our desire to live with nature trying to kill us all the time, it forms that struggle. The struggles have survived gives rise to the changes in genes, which eventually are selected and convert to evolution. So it all begins with the struggle to survive and the desire to survive. Right, And this is spelled out by Darwin himself. Yeah, should we read some of his quotes, Uh this is These are from the on the Origin of the Species, which if you just listen to the Charles Starwin, you know, that was his most famous work that he put up, one of many, but that's his uh you know, warrant Peace. It's close second was my travels with Timmy about his pet rabbit and he going around the county bothering neighbors. So he here are you with the Here a few of the basic tenants in on the origin of the species and with some quotes from Darwin himself. One is the organisms show variations of a variation of traits. Yeah, that's him just getting it out of the way, like, don't be dumb. If you think that your your dad's blue eyes and your brow and eyes are revolution, you're wrong. Okay, I like that better than his quote. Actually, let's do that. Let's do Josh's take on his quote. I'll do what I can, all right. Uh. Number two is more organisms are born that could ever possibly be supported by the resources here on the planet. That's right. Uh, stop being such an idiot. There's such a thing as scarcity, don't you know that. I mean this is great. Um, I feel the birth of the new podcast coming. Number three. Therefore, in conclusion, all organisms must struggle to live. You already kind of covered that, okay. Um. Number four, some traits offer advantages in the struggle. That's right. Uh, those are mutations, and as Josh will eventually predict, epigenetics, not always mutations though right changes to Allele's um. Organisms that have those traits are the ones that will help you survive, are more likely to be successful and reproduce and pass them on. And then finally successful variations the ones that we have just talked about that allow you to survive and reproduce more. They accumulate over the years and the generations as they are exposed to something we'll talk about in a minute called population pressure. Right. And he points out too that this is essentially specific and local. Like UM, if humans had a right where you cooled extremely easily all the time, UM, under under all conditions, it wouldn't play very well. When you move to the northern latitudes, you die, so it would be selected out of populations in the northern latitudes. But if you lived in the tropics, it would probably be selected um and propagated over time because you probably have a lot more energy. You wouldn't just be laying around fanning yourself with palm fronds. Well you do that too, but you wouldn't need to. Yeah, but it's just it's a nice experience. UM. So I mentioned population pressure, and that's a key here to understanding this whole bowl of soup. And we'll talk about that right after this message. All right, So here we are in the stew I called it soup. It's really a stew of evolution and that section. So we need to talk about population pressure, which is basically anything in a population that makes it tough for your species. Are you, as an individual plant or animal to survive it? Yeah? Again, because there's such things scarcity that means you compete with people in your species or people outside of your species, right, like a lion wants to eat you. Yeah, there's always it's always going on, yes, um. And then even if you lived in total harmony with all the plants and animals around you and vice versa, nature is still shooting lightning bolts at you, train your floods, droughts, famine, all that stuff there is always in and is Darwin put it like every organism struggles to survive one way or another. Yeah, And that can really speed things up as far as alleal frequency change, Like if you flood it out an entire country, you're gonna see some big changes within a generation or two. It's not necessarily over hundreds of years, that's right, um. And that's because Uh. When you have something especially like uh, a flood or drought or just some severe increase sudden increase in population pressure, it goes from just background population pressure to something very acute and pronounced. I got a lot of the population dies off. Yeah, Like his example is pretty great. Actually about the fire. Let's say a fire killed all the vegetation under fifteen feet and a population of giraffes, anything under fifteen feet is gonna have a hard time reaching food, and so they're gonna start reproducing and making taller giraffes pretty much as fast as they can write. The ones that can't reach food will die off, a lot of them before they can reproduce. The ones that can reach food will live to reproduce, which will produce those taller giraffes. Um, And what just happened then in that giraffe example is called a population bottleneck. Something happened that took a large population, reduced it down to a smaller amount. And then usually in that smaller group, there's going to be some traits or whatever that used to be evenly distributed among the population that are now really concentrated and clustered. And like it could be something super rare that is now the trade right exactly. So if you have a super rare trait spread out very evenly among a large population, that trait may or may not ever be selected, and if it is selected, it may take a very long time to be selected because there's so many other competing traits. Well, when a lot of those other competing traits are narrow we weeded out, and you have that population bottlenecked, those traits are going to be very pronounced and they they're going to be selected very quickly. So you have a very quick change in evolution as a result of sudden acute population bottlenecks. Yeah, it basically becomes the norm. So in that area of where the fire ended up killing shorter giraffes, the norm will now be super tall giraffes exactly. And don't say chuck. All giraffes are super tall, super super tall, super super tall. And this is apparently happened to humans. Um there's a population bottleneck. Supposedly around seventy tho years ago. Um uh, there was something called the Toba eruption, huge supervolcano created like a six to ten year long winner and dropped the number of humans Homo sapiens down to something as low as possibly three thousand people. Yeah, so, uh, the planet on the whole planet, and they're not quite sure like what what um variations were selected out of that, but you can bet there was an enormous change within years of that event. Boy, I wonder what it was like before that, right, it's pretty interesting. So let's say the giraffes, like everything was hunky dory, no fires, no nothing, but just some of them decided that they wanted to see if there really are no such thing as zebras in South America. So they hop on a boat and they sailed to South America and they establish a new little giraffe colony there. Yeah, well we'll result from that is called the founder effect. And there is a band, by the way, I already looked, no, yeah, I thought there's gotta be one, and it is h and I listen to their song. How is it? It was pretty good? What kind of music, you know, sort of uh, giraffe in the Giraffe shoegazy. Okay, not bad? Um so anyway, Yeah, the founder effect is when you quite literally, when a population founds a new area and don't have sex with that other population anymore. Right, So, and you can have very different traits from even if it's a giraffe, from the ones in Africa, because they set up camp in a new place, right, and it's almost like an unforced bottleneck. Yeah, you know they have voluntary bottleneck. Yeah. Nature didn't kill off a bunch of the population. The population just broke off from from a larger group to a smaller group. And that smaller groups probably going to have some weird trader too that are going to be select and and push evolution along faster than usual. Yeah, alright, let's talk about this then. Okay, let me pose a question to you, sir, that I know the answer to. Uh, what about things that don't evolve anymore? Buddy? What about like the shark that's been about the same for millions of years? Show me your natural selection? There? I got this, Okay. So sharks are a great example, um, because they haven't changed in millions of years because they don't need to. Well, because basically they became apex predators a long time ago in their environments, and their environments went unchanged enough so that sharks didn't need to change. They are basically as far as natural selection goes perfect. Yeah, they early on figured it out. It's like, all right, I've got my my teeth and are great. My my gills are working. I can send electrical impulses from can swim super fast, I can kill everything I see. As long as something doesn't punch me in the nose, I'm pretty much good. Or kill me for my sharks, then well that's yeah. It makes you wonder how sharks you are gonna evolve now. But let's say pre human fishing, so, uh, two hundred years ago up to from several million, maybe tens, I don't remember how long sharks have been around virtually unchanged. Yeah, so uh, let's say from millions and millions, millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of years ago up to two hundred years ago. Sharks are virtually unchanged because they hit their peak and they're fine. But that doesn't mean that they have gone unchanged or that natural selection hasn't exerted an effect on them. Basically, what happens is they're still undergoing mutations through reproduction. There's new allele's showing up, but none of them are holding it. Can hold a candle to the perfection. That's been achieved by the shark, so they get selected out. They don't get a chance to um to reproduce in the population or become distributed amongst the population. So if you still have natural selection weeding out, but rather than changing the shark population or the shark species um our family family you have, you have a natural selection as an agent of stability. Yeah, or I guess if let's do a hypothetical, if we were going to use shark finn shark finning as an example, Let's say only sharks with you know, perfectly triangular gray fins were selected out right to be finned and cut off for shark fin soup. So that means sharks that have like weird spots on their fins would not get killed. So theoretically, hypothetically, over generations, we might see sharks with only spotted fins, and that probably will happen because of the sudden and acute population pressure being exerted on sharks by humans. There has to be some sort of forced adaptation that's gonna occur. Yeah. I don't know what the criteria for a good fin though is, or if they just take them all like whatever they can catch, but I mean it could be as simple as something like UM figuring out that they like just swimming deeper and not coming up and like within the humans grass like just yeah just stay. Yeah, we should say that that's a really good point. UM. A trait isn't necessarily something that is um visibly apparent, like it like height or something like that. It can be an ability or a proclivity like grabster uses the example of UM dogs have evolved UM the trait of UM hanging out with humans and chuck, UM tell them about the elephants because that's a pretty good example of what we're talking about. Sharks. Yeah. Yeah, Well, elephants, as we know, are killed many times for their ivory tusks. And it's sort of a no, it's a good news bad news scenario. You would think, hey, good news, there's some elephants that were being born without tusks at all, so they're not being hunted. And over the years, now there it went from like like close, now are not born with tusks, So you think that's awesome because now they're not being hunted, but they need those tusks for digging in defense and things like that, so they're they're losing a valuable trait which is going to put stress on the population as a whole, I would think over time. But in the near term it's been selected out because it's keeping the elephants alive because the ones that were naturally without tusks weren't being killed by poachers, so they were allowed to reproduce more frequently than ones with tusks that were being killed. So, yeah, you have a within a human lifetime, within seventy years or so, the population has evolved. Yeah, that's what I mean by like you can see it happening in front of us, right, And this is where the debate comes from. Where I was saying, like, scientists even debate on how evolution changes or happens um. And there's basically the difference between um gradualism or punctuated equilibrium and gradualism is just over time, very slowly new ah lials appear, and some of them tend to make organisms fitter, and so they'll eventually, over very long stretches of time, be selected out and then uh, punctuated equilibrium is like we're talking about with the African elephants, where there's a sudden population pressure and all of a sudden, this organism or species is forced to evolve, and they do, and then after that everything evens out for a little while and stays the same until the next catastrophic event. Yeah, I don't get it. There A it says there's an ongoing debate about that. Can't they both exist? I don't understand why they don't both exist. It seems like one is just constant background evolution and the other one is um like evolution as a result of you know, sudden acute crises. Why wouldn't they both think? I don't understand it either, if the looking at them. Okay, Chuck, So let's go a little further and well, I guess we'll go back to jeans. But um, remember you know a guy named Richard Dawkins, Right, He wrote a book in the seventies called The Selfish Gene, and it basically we were talking about, you know, the debate between gradualism and equilibrium punctuated equilibrium. Well, Dawkins came along and said, you guys, shut up for a little bit, let's talk about this the Selfish Gene, And he just basically reframed the entire way that people look at evolution. Yeah, I thought, I think it's pretty interesting. Uh. The essence of it is that as long as you reproduce, then natural selection doesn't care about you after that, right after you've passed on your genes. That's the important part. Uh. In the case of spiders is one great example. Sometimes the male gets eaten right afterward. Yeah, or like praying manness. This didn't the female eat the the male's head, like bite the male's head off, And we're talking about praying mannesses, So it's okay to say female um in that case. Though both those cases, natural selection doesn't care. The male has done his job. He is propagated and passed down the allele and it doesn't matter if he dies or not. Right afterward. It doesn't put any stress on the population. No. And that's like a really there was a tricky thing before Dawkins came along. It was like, wait a minute, there's a real problem with natural selection if if the whole point is for something to be able to reproduce and reproduce successfully, like, why would there be um adaptations that kills Yeah, where like the organism is killed like as a result of reproduction. That doesn't make any sense. And Dawkins came along and said, it doesn't make sense if you stop look king at organism and start looking at the genes. Basically, like none of that matters, right, So he he made his point so well that it actually got a little bit out of hand. Um and it came to be known as well. It was the selfish team before, but basically it was. He characterized it so well that it became a character. Jeans became a character almost like they had hijacked organisms and we're using them as husks to pass along themselves, like a virus or something like that. Um and Dawkins came out a number of times and it's like, no, that's the wrong interpretation, that's not what I mean. But it's still essentially the same thing. It's just m yeah, yeah, we are we we we are a means of passing along our genes. And if you look at it through the lens of natural selection, the the as long as the genes are able to be passed along, the vessel is no longer necessary. So therefore the head can be bitten off by the woman. That's right. But like we said, this isn't widespread, but it does help explain things like spiders, right, you know, But there's a big flaw in this selfish gene theory right, well, and Dawkins theories as a whole. Right, there's the flaw is is that there's such a thing as altruism. Yeah, and this is you know, humans and animals that, for no reasons based on natural selection, desire to help each other doesn't benefit you in the least at all. Know it. As a matter of fact, it can harm you before you're able to reproduce. So even from the genetic level of the selfish gene um, it doesn't make any sense because you're the genes are allowing the organism to be harmed before it could possibly reproduce. What why Why does someone have an instinct to jump in an icy river to save somebody? And they have found that it is instinctual and that it happens in infants with like zero cultural training. It's like part of us. Yeah, and it's not a human it's either. There are plenty of animals that um that display altruism as well, like mere cats are big on altruism. Yeah, and I like the explanation. It makes again total sense to me. Something called kinship. If you've got a couple of different families, took Tuk's family and and Bartok's family. Well, Bartok is a composer. But what's another good cave man name. Uh, yeah, that's a great one. So Mango's family is very selfish. They don't like to share their their stuff. They're all competing for the same food. Tuktok's family is very generous. They like to share things. So over time they will be a more successful family because they have been altruistic and shown that kinship and they're they're improving their chances of success by combining their their efforts into a group effort um, which is kind of like that Paleolithic warlessness we talked about in the Cave Dwellers episode. Oh yeah, where everybody just kind of figured out that, like they could be more successful if they stopped fighting and started harvesting together. Um, and if you kind of look at it like that, like everybody coming together as a group for a common goal. You're also looking at super organisms. Yeah, have we done one on ants specifically? No? I think we should. I agree, because they are about the best example of a super organism. It's basically the little worker ants aren't doing the reproducing. They can't even reproduce their that goes to the top dogs. They only get to do that. So all those little worker ants aren't even passing on their genes, but they're still busting their little aunt butts for the colony. And um a super organism basically then is to step back and say, let's not look at ants, but let's look at the ant colony as an organism, as one organism, And that explains the altruism in that ant sacrificing its own ability to pass along its genes in order to serve the colony as a whole. Then it makes sense like Papa aunt is going to pass down the jenes. I just need to make sure Papa aunt has food and water, right, And you can also use that same um argument to explain why, Like it would make sense if um, you know, you jumped in to save your son from a river. That kinship explains that. But why would you jump in to save someone else's son. Well, if you look at it like, well, this kid's part of the same species and shares a lot of the same genes as you, you're ensuring that your species genes are passed along. Yeah, and you get to humble brag on Facebook Yeah, how bad big time? Oh pretty boring day. Just saved the kid from the river and the icy river. No, biggie, just helped ensure as jeans get passed along. I guess a humble brag that would be, um, well, it looks like my shoes are ruined that I just bought, jumped into an icy river, and saved the kid. Yeah, that'd be good one. We should start this doing fake humble brags on Twitter, Facebook. Oh, this brand new BMW I got has the windshield wipers are busted. Not a day for it. It's raining. That's just being a jerk, Okay, all right, So now we should talk about something that also excites me. Vestigial and attavistic traits. Um. All organisms carry some trait that is really no benefit and really is no longer expressing itself as a means to help you survive. But it's not harming you either, so it hasn't been selected out, so it's just there. And UM, I've got some pretty good examples in the human body. UM one summer behavioral summer actual organs like the appendix. Many people think the appendix is of this vestigial organ I heard that it might fight cancer. Well now that now scientists are starting to say, we think it might fight cancer, or it might house um like bacteria that helps you aid in digestion. So everybody who's a pendics we took out get inline. We're gonna put them back in. But for many years, and I think the debate is still out whether or not it is a remnant from primate ancestors when um we had to digest like plants like super rich in cellulose or something. Yeah, I got that. We don't anymore. So that's why the appendix really does nothing. Back when we were giant termite men, scary time sinuses, that was what we were like. On the other side of the population bottleneck, giant termite people. Sinuses supposedly may um there. It's also debated. But their pockets of air in your face, and no one really knows if they serve any kind of biological function or not. Yeah, and they kind of suck too, because they get infected. They can't get infected the coxics. It's pretty exciting because it's a tailbone that used to be a tail, and some people are still born with them. Yeah, and the people who are born with tails are atavistic because they're out of atavisms. It's it's a vestigial remnant that UM expresses itself very closely to the way it actually used to be. It's not just a trace of it anymonger. It is like it's like that Alleale saying, hey, maybe we should go back to tails again. What do you think? But yeah, it's not um. Just so you don't picture like a human with a big four ft long monkey tail, it's usually like a bumper or something. Didn't George Costanza have a tail? And uh what was that one? Jack Black Fairly brothers? Oh yeah, yeah, shallow, yeah, yeah, I think you're right, and you could wag it. I don't remember that. Uh what else? Um? Oh, here's a behavior um of this digital behavior of the palmer grasp reflex. Oh yeah, I thought this is cool. It's pretty neat. When you go up to a little uh stinky, dirty human baby and you put your finger in their hand or their foot even it's gonna grab it like super hard and super strong. Yeah, like Popeye basically, or like a little baby monkey trying to hang onto mama, cruising through the jungle through the grabbing onto the coat their mom's coat. Yeah, so basically that's a behavior they think is is like a human baby now doesn't need to grasp hold of something that hard at six weeks old, So it's a behavior. Maybe. So we we played tennis thanks to a vestigial behavior and ability, I don't oh got it being able to grip that racket? Yeah? What's what article is this from? Is it? Um? Was it? Ion nine? Yeah? I think so. It was kind of silly, But these are some pretty decent examples. We we've talked about in male nipples before, you know, we did. We did a whole episode on um goose bumps, the erector pilly. I've never heard of this? Oh I did it? Dump be dumb on it? You want to explain what it is real quick? There you go ahead, okay, Um, everyone has had goose bumps. The erector pilly are those muscle fibers that give you goose bumps when you don't even necessarily want them or need them. Right, there's little musts that are attached to your hair follicles, whether you have hair there or not any longer, and they press it up so that your hair stands on end, either to make yourself look bigger, so you're scary, or because you're cold, to make your coat fluff out, as in when we used to have coats because we were animals. Another vestigial trait, and uh, my favorite one aside from tonsils, is the like a similar nearus. Did you like how you asked me if I wanted to do it? And I was like no, And then I did it anyway. I knew it. I knew that was coming. If you look in your mirror and you look at your eyeball, and you look in the little inside corner of your eyeball, um, you're gonna see a little fold of tissue and it's not the little bump, but it's that little thing in the inside corner of your eye that is a remnant of a third eyelid. What's it called? What kind of eyelid? The p L I C A plica or like a similar nearis And uh, apparently we had third eyelids that would that were clear, so you could like wash your eye and still keep an eye out for predators. And they would come from the side rather than up and down. They moved horizontally. Yeah, like a snake or a reptile, yeah, or a bird. They still have them, Man, we do not, but we still have that in the corner of our eye even though it does nothing. So here's the thing. We have the jenes then to make that. Yeah, if we needed it again, so that Allele could possibly come back, like we could have people who were born with that, and like if it ended up helping us, Um, like if we could sleep with our eyes upen to watch the zombie invasion or to watch TV better twenty four hours a day. Uh. Just the fact that we can wiggle our ears, that's a vestigial trait. There's no reason why we should be able to wiggle our ears. I can wiggle, mind, can you do them one at a time, you're wiggling you're eyebrows. I'm gonna go in my whole face, I know. Can you do one at a time? Like that's pretty Actually, well that means like human's going bananas right now. So, uh, that means that maybe Josh's ancestors, Uh, we're a little closer than mine. And as far as uh, monkeys directing their ears to listen out for predators. Yeah, no, it means I'm less evolved as a human being. I have, like the ability to move ears, so I can hear things that I don't need to anymore. And I'm fairly harry, So this has been a depressing episode for me in that respect. I didn't want to mention any of that stuff. So, Chuck, we talked about um African elephants. You want to give a couple more examples of uh natural selection and action. The ball worm. Sometimes it happens super fast. In the case of the ball worm, it's happening faster than we can create toxins to kill them. Yeah, like they treat now with no the genetically engineered so cotton produces it itself. Yeah, I guess it's not treating I guess it is originally treated cotton. But now cotton is growing with this toxin that is supposed to kill bullworms. But enough bulworms h were immune to that that they were the ones that went on to do the most reproducing to eat the cotton. I'm sure that that first generation of bullworms were like, I'm so wasted off this cotton, but I'm alive. Uh. And then the clovers. Some species of clover have mutation that made poison cyanide leak from its cells, causing it to be bitter. Therefore it wouldn't be eaten. Isn't that weird? Yeah, just that the clovers like don't eat me. Yeah. I make cyanide somehow. Yeah, but unfortunately, when the temperature drops blow freezing that sells rupture releases that cyanide into the plant and it kills itself. However, in warm climates that doesn't happen. So what you end up with is clover in warmer climates that's completely different structurally cellularly than the one in the colder climate. Yeah, the warmer ones produced sanide, the ones in the colder climates don't same clover. It's very much like that example of Um, you know the humans that can cool constantly playing well in the tropics but not in north Pretty cool stuff. Yea, man, I love this. You got anything else? I got nothing else? Oh well, let's talk about ourselves a little bit real quick. Really, Yes, what's your sign from the Pisces? I can't wiggle my ears? Um? No, humans like we have, like I was saying, we have jets now, so like we're one large population right. Um. That's just one example of how we've essentially taken ourselves out of the evolution game. We even more to the point, we have such thing as birth control, artificial birth control. UM, we have a lot of different things that we do inadvertently or advert only to UM, to adapt, to change ourselves, to change our ability to reproduce whatever. So I wonder, then, are we UM out of the evolution game already forever? Will we ever be able to if we're not? Yeah? And I mean is that the case? Like I know, it's the goal of trans humanism is to say so long, suckers the evolution and just be totally in charge. But I also wonder, like UM with birth control, birth control is an artificial it's it's unnatural selection. Yeah, it's artificial black aide to reproducing, right, which flies in the face of natural selection. My question is is natural selection enough of a UM powerful process that eventually UM women are going to start evolving an immunity to birth control, or is human ingenuity so strong that it's like we've got natural selection beaten. It's just gone now, it's done for us aside from fires and floods and famines and droughts and all that. But I mean, like on that graduated or gradual background natural selection, or we have we taken ourselves out of that I wonder or is it enough of a population pressure to have the effect to begin with? Yeah, just from the fact that there's so many humans that that that there's scarcity exists. So I guess not. I guess we just answered my question. Man. I really didn't think it was going to get answered, but it just did. We're still under the effects and influence of natural selection. It's a podcast miracle bow before natural selection humans. I want to take a second to say hi to all the sixth through ninth grade science classes who are listening to this right now. I assume there's at least one or two Hi. Okay, so natural selection right, all right? Uh, if you want to learn more about natural selection, you can type those words into the search par at how stuff works dot com. It will bring up a world class article by the Grabster. Uh. And since I said search part, it means it's time for a listener mail. I'm gonna call this We're curing people of disease. Nice, Hi, guys and Jerry, you have a very large in a very large way to help cure my six year old niece Eva of lyme disease. For several months, he experienced a series of strange symptoms that didn't seem to relate to one another, including infection, muscle weakness, double vision. After months of testing, her doctors were at a complete loss as to what to do and what was wrong. Because the once cheerful, enthusiastic little girl began to withdraw. She was unable to go to school for periods of time and quit all her beloved after school activities. Um one day, she said to my sister, Mommy, there are two of you. One is up here, one is down there. Which one is the real you? Another alarming and creeping creepy statement was, my legs don't work anymore. Enter Uncle Josh and Uncle Chuck. After listening to the podcast on how ticks Work, I encourage my sister to have my niece tested for lime disease. Despite not having any evidence of being bitten or being in a region known for dear ticks. She was tested and indeed did have lime disease. That is awesome, Uncle Josh and Uncle Chuck really saved the day on this one. Ava was in pain, confused, and very afraid because she didn't understand what was happening. None of the doctors suspected lime disease. And I never would have pushed for it without or even tested for it in the first place, if your podcast hadn't tipped me off to the possibility. That is so cool that the girl owas like her well being to us, uh and to the doctors that have helped her to a lesser extent. After the treatment, she's back to her old, happy, studious and energetic self. She's a brilliant young girl and we'll have a bright future thanks to you guys having her back and making her full recovery possible. Much love, Michelle Marianni. That's awesome. Thanks for letting us know that, Michelle. Ava. Right, Yeah, it's really neat way to go Ava, way to beat that Lime disease. Stupid ticks hate ticks, even hate the episode. That was a great one. We need to do aligned disease episode when they're supposedly it is very controversial and I've never really looked into it. Okay, I've heard you could make money selling your blood. I don't know if that's true. Oh it is okay. Uh. You have to do on the black market though, because they don't pay on the regular market. It's all like, well, I'm a do gooder. Um, So if you want to get in touch with Chuck and I to let us know how we helped you or a relative out, we love hearing that kind of stuff, or you can just get in touch to say hi or whatever you want.
