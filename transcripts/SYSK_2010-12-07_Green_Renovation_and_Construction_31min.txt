Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready, are you hey? And welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Dressed like me today, all right? You can even get like a little food stained right there, just like, Yeah, I'm wearing like a plaid collar shirt with a sweater over it. And Josh came up and it's like, what's up with that? You're stealing my look? And you are, but you wear it well, Chuck. Well, if you came in with a T shirt with a hole in it and a half beard and a baseball cap, you would yell at me too, flip flops. I would say the same thing. You get out the car radio antenna again, wouldn't you? Yeah, all right, what's your set up here? Well? Okay, you ready for my set up? This is all business, isn't it. Let's do it all right, Chuck? You're heard of J. B. McKinnon. No, have you ever heard of the hundred Mile Food Movement? Yes? Okay, so J. B. McKinnon and uh I think his girlfriend were the people who originated this and wrote that book. Plenty that's the idea that you try to not eat any food that's more than a hundred miles from your home, right, right, And that kind of lends itself to seasonal leading. Yeah, um, he said, apparently good luck finding a beer that was produced within a hundred miles like grown produced all within a hundred miles. Right. But yea, it's the local basis of the local war movement, or at least the mouthpiece of it. Right. So he's become kind of this boy wonder and environmentalism as a whole since that book was released, people look to him for advice and he puts on his glasses and clears his throat and gives it to him sometimes. Um. But McKinnon uh had this pretty awesome article um that was republished in the October September October e Reader Uh and it was about basically not getting paralyzed by having so many problems presented to us like we do, right, And he cites the sociologists paralyzed into not taking action there's nothing I can do, or into taking too much action, which is equally problematic. Right. Um. There's a uh famous sociologist named Stanley Cohen, and Cohen that j b. McKinnon sites this isn't me, I'm just a fan. Um. McKinnon cites Cohen's book States of Denial, and basically in it, Cohen's like he talks about how we delude ourselves into inaction right largely because it's just too much or you know, we're trying to do too much. And he says, you know, there's only so much we can do, and we can't waste our energy on every single problem that we face. So what mckinnons McKinnon suggests is um called vertical agitation, where you pick one topic and you give it everything you've got. If you want to save the dolphins, you save those dolphins, you know, if you want to um, make sure every single person in America follows through on this compact fluorescent bulb thing. That's your thing to make that your movement. If you are interested in reducing the waste stream, that's your thing. And this is your podcast. Thanks straight, this is your podcast. I think I like the outtake better. Nope, Okay, well, let's plug ahead, chuckers Chuck. Specifically, we're gonna start out with the problem that well, let's talk about this one of the biggest sectors of municipal waste. That waste stream huge. Right. One of the big way, one of the big areas of thought today is figuring out how to reduce to the wast stream. And there's all sorts of ideas. There's a carpet company and I can't remember what it's called, but it's headed by this great idealist visionary um and they least carpeting. You never own the carpeting in your house. You lease it, which is you're paying all the same price or whatever. But you when you have it taken out, you can't take it to dump because it's not yours. That company takes it back and they recycle it it is, so it's being diverted from the waste stream, right. So uh. One of the biggest um, one of the biggest sectors of municipal waste that accounts for I think are accounting for of all the waste generated and taken to the dumps in the United States is called construction and demolition waste. One big way of converting or diverting i'm sorry, waste from this waste stream away from the municipal dump and back into reuse is demolition over recyc remodeling, I'm sorry over full demolition, right, if you're renovating your your old home, yes, tearing it down starting over. The problem is is with with being green. I'm making air quotes. It's gonna I'm gonna do that every time I say that word. Okay, okay, it's been so co opted. But being green is a matter of details and context, right, right, So like recycling, recycling is good, right, just just putting your bottles and cans out by the curb. That's just a good idea, isn't it not in every case? Buddy? Like what, Well, wouldn't you be better off simply reusing a bottle rather than throwing it out and and having it picked up by what is actually a garbage truck, is just taking it to a different place. Well yeah, I mean that's and we mentioned this before. I can't remember which one it was in, but we need to point out again that's why the reduce, reuse, recycle, it's in an order for a reason. Reduces the best thing you can do. Don't even use that bottle, use your little aluminum bottle to get your water. Fill it up with your little filtered water at home, and just use that reuse if you happen to have a bottle, and we do a lot of this. Just keep filling that thing up, and then at PCB and then at the very last resort you can recycle. And if you're not doing any of those three things, then you're just a jerk pretty much. That's what I say. Yeah, recycle, you're right there. I mean, you gotta have those big trucks that smashing anything together and deliver it to places and plants, and there's a lot of a lot of greenhouse gases admitted when you do that, there's a lot of waste, there's a lot of fuel spent. Yes, and the recycling process the same. But recycling generally is good. The same thing can be said for renovating. Renovating is generally better than demolition, but it is on a case by case basis, and it has to do with how you do it. There's actually, like, you know, a green our way to to renovate. But if you're looking at a house, an old house, and you say, I'm either gonna tear this down or I'm gonna totally remodel it, but I want to go green, which when should I do? The rule of thumb generally is to renovate simply because it produces less less waste, yes, right, and plus all the materials it takes to build something from the ground up is obviously going to be more. Even if you took the house down to the foundation and the studs, right, You're still gonna be saving on the foundation and the studs as far as buying new and manufacturing new materials. You've got a stat here, josh, um about a hundred and thirty six million tons of waste every year, which is about of what's filling up our city dumps is construction, demolition waste. Now I have something surprising for you. I have. I've got a little surprised chuck. Oh good, that was two thousand seven, man, what's it now in two ten if a hundred and forty two million tons were generated, which they were, And this is all construction and demolition, which includes highway construction and repair, which accounts for a lot of it. Um, guess how much is estimated to be recycled this year? To be recycled, I don't know. Out of a hundred forty two million tons recycled, that's fantastic. So a lot of this is it's being diverted away from it. Right, So there's success. Right. People are fine, are learning how to do this, and that's a big part of it is is not just um, not demolishing your house, but even if you do demolish it, recycling the parts that are demolished, reusing parts. Like you mentioned the Seattle based store restore, they got one this here in Atlanta to do they Yeah, it's great. Man. Is there a restore store like officially restore? I think it's called a restore. And Emily and I are renovating a house very slowly. Yeah. I was gonna say, are you still doing that? When I first met you, You're like, yeah, I renovate every weekend. Yeah, that's not every weekend now, it's it's very slowly. What's the last thing you did? Uh? We did some yards stuff, yard stuff like fences and stairs and things like that. You're still squatting, huh. It's it's slow. Yeah, we're squatting. Um. So far, so good. Um. But restore is awesome because instead of going too like your big box retailer to buy your new door, go to one of these restore places and they'll have like sixty doors that have been taken from houses and in great shape and maybe even cooler and more you know, a period looking than than the ones you can get at the big box place. So and they have not only that, I mean it's not just doors. They have like windows and window frames, they have would they have all kinds of things that have been removed from houses for re sale. So that's a very good way to go if you're restoring your home. It is and restore in any outfit like this. They tend to be nonprofit, is right. They get their their supplies by people bringing them in and selling them to them, and then they mark it up YadA YadA, or else they donate it and sell it. Right, it's donated to restore, or at least in Seattle, Restore will actually undertake demolition projects, so they'll charge you to demolish your house, but they do it by hand. They keep the nails, like down to the nails. Everything is recycled. Everything that could possibly be recycled is recycled. One of the cool things is um since they're nonprofit and since they're taking the stuff that can be salvage to resell in their store, you get a tax deduction. So it may be slightly more than like what the guy with the bulldozers going to charge you, But ultimately, with the tax deduction, it may it may come out to be less and you get that good conscience thing, good karma come in your way. Yeah, well you mentioned the projects they do by hand. Um the e p A rated four of these um from restore and they rated between seventy and nine reuse ratings. That's amazing reuse and one of the other big benefits of um demolishing your house by hand. I mean it's slow, it's way way slower, but um, you know, the trees in your yard have roots, and a bulldozer with tracks, even a bobcat can conceivably do it. Depending on how shallow the roots system is. Running over it can kill your tree. It's not good. It's a lot worse than running over your foot. And you've all I've heard of nightmares from friends of mine where you know, accidents happen when you get those big machines in there, like oops, I accidentally dug into your sewer line or oops, I accidentally cracked your gas line. I mean, these things are supposed to be well marked, but you got a hundred in your house. You never know what's going on underground and so and then once that happens, it's not only more money, but it's not good for what's going on in your environment local environment. If you are demolishing your house and you are not paying to you resorted do it. Let's say you're doing it yourself. You've got some time, just feel like beating the tar out of some drywall with a sledge hammer. Um, there is there. You can put your stuff on Craigslist. Um. In addition to not having to pay to dump it, people will actually at the very least come take it away for free for their own use. Yeah. Right, So you can say, hey, I've got a really great door, here's a picture of it. Who wants it? You can get away with getting rid of anything on Craigslist and this is the free section. Like troll it any day and you will see I've got a pile of bricks. I got a pile of this, And people will come and get it because they need that pile of bricks, because bricks ain't cheap. That's right. And you might even be able to charge them if you're a savvy demolisher for taking away your stuff. Yes, there's also I wish I knew the name of the company, but I saw one of the home rena shows a few years ago. Right, what home reno show is that? Really? Are you going like an abbreviated name basis home renovation television program? Am Uh, This company will come out and take all of your demolition let's say you are demolishing it. They will take your demolition waste on site, put it into this machine that pulverizes it into little bits of nothingness and separates the nails at the same time, like you see it shaking, the nails are coming out the side. And then what they do then is they've got like half of your house and little pebble sized chunks, and then they'll lay it under your driveway and then pave on top of that. So right there, it's all on site, and it's probably not the cheapest thing in the world, but you get to have a clear conscience that you didn't go to the city dump and put your house on it. Essentially, this is what you're doing. We should probably also say that if you are going to save a few bucks, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of ten grand and demolish your house yourself, Um, you should watch some videos on it, talk to some people who have done it before. It can actually be kind of dangerous. You're deconstructing your house and it could fall on top of you. Demolition is very dangerous. You need to know what you're doing. You need to have the right gear. Don't be a dummy. Don't be a dummy. You want to talk a little bit more about green building. Yeah, So let's say you've gutted your house and you're in the market to maybe make some greener improvements, right, right, So let's talk green building. Dude. Well, there's green materials. And you may not know this, but pretty much any material that you need to build your house, you can find a recycled version of that if you look hard enough. So that's where you should start. Well, you're looking at well, there's two different ways that something can come to be recycled post industrial, so like um fly ash in your concrete could be recycled. It could be captured from you know, an industrial as industrial waste um and that's actually good. I think fly ashes is particularly bad to just bury. It's good to use it up from what I understand, Or it could be post in sumer, meaning like somebody took their toilet paper roll, put it in the recycling stream, and now it's part of your wood floor. Because that does happen sometimes. The laminate floors you can get is recycled things pressed together with a wood vineer on top. Right, easy to install, cheap, cheap, cheap. Yes. And if you have a playground, have you been to the Piedmont Park playground? No? But does it have one of those rubber floors? It is so much fun to walk on, Josh. Another thing too, is you can they have this wood now quote unquote wood that you can use for decking. That's not wood, it's actually recycled bottles. Yeah, but it looks like wood pet bottles, not glass bottles. Yeah. And then speaking of quote unquote wood, bamboo flooring is huge. It's actually a grass draw of bamboo. Is that it grows back in five to six years, like takes a twenty years, I think to to mature filly again. You know you know what that's called? Then a sustainable product. Really, that's what sustainable means. I have not heard that phrase before. Uh, you can recycle steel, you can melt it down, reform it, reshape it. The World Trade Center was largely recycled. I don't know if you knew that I did, And in fact, there was a big breuhaha afterward because a lot of the families of victims from the Twin Towers following said that's evidence. You should study it. And then Bloomberg, who was an engineer, another engineer, said, you know, it's should be recycled. There's not a lot you can learn about the structural integrity of the building from actually looking at the collapse steel. You need to look at like computer programs that show how it was built. So we appreciate you saying that, but we're going to recycle it. Bloomberg was an engineer. I don't know, I said that, so I hope so I thought. I thought I read that he was an engineer at one point. He's a sharp attack maybe not. Cork floor is another um option if you want to go green. Besides, it's sustainable as well. Yeah, because bamboo a crly um. It's susceptible the spottiness from exposure to UV well both oh corcus to corcus too. But you need to know this going in. If you don't, uh, if you live in a house where you have a room that's not like the sun beating down on it at all times. Maybe that's a good option. Like bathroom, Yeah, exactly, the bathroom that's windowless. You know that doctor's office we went to the day was bamboo before. Had you seen that? Unmistakable? You can tell people you have grass floor, you can you can tell people you have a grass floor. Bamboo is grass? Yeah, okay, I don't. I don't know. Um. Tankless water heaters obviously, I think we might have talked about this before. Do you have one? Are you just a fan? No, I'm just a fan. It's called on demand heating. And the idea here is if you don't know about these, is that your your water heater in your basement. If it's a tank, water heater is just a big tank full of water and it's always being kept hot. So if if you need a shower or it's gonna be hot. If you're out of town for a week, you know, they say turn it down, but if you don't, it's still gonna be eating that water for nothing. On demand heating means they heat the water at the source, then it flows into your faucet and uh is hot upon demand instead of keeping it all hot you can. You can have one for the whole house, or if you just want to have one by like just for your dishwasher, you can do that, have like a smaller one, and they're a little bit more expensive, but you get that money back. You'll save it eventually, so they will pay for themselves. Yeah. Well, most of the stuff like solar heating and all that kind of thing, and wind energy, that's all. You know, there's a payoff eventually. So you just gotta look at how long you're gonna be living there, how much the investment is, what kind of tax breaks you're gonna get, and figure out if it makes sense for you, or if you've just got the dough and you want to do a really green thing, then just do it anyway. That's what I say. Insulation, Yeah, I like this one. Go ahead. Then, so you've got I think heating and cooling is about thirty of your the average bill, right, average utility. I don't know, while insulation can save fifteen, right, but you're heating and cooling is about thirty percent of like all the money you put out a month on the utilities, So you proper insulations save fift That not too shabby. The problem is this fiberglass, and fiberglass can be well, not so good for the lungs. This is a kid from Liby Owen's corning Forward right down. They've gotten better with it, but you still when you see the dudes come in, they've got on like the hazmat suit, and you think, what am I lining my home with? If these guys can't touch it or breathe it, how about this line your home instead with old jeans, old blue jeans and newspaper. Yeah, it's pretty cool. And they spray this stuff in. They've you ever seen it? I have, and it's fascinating it. And not only that, so it's a double doozy. So not only are you getting they say it rates better as insulation, you're not using the harmful, potentially toxic fiberglass, and you're taking all this newspaper and blue jeans and saving it from the landfill. So it's like a triple whammy right there. So what else do we have? Chuck? You got countertops, recycled paper and glass, and aluminum concrete is really popular these days. Don't forget to use that post industrial fly ash concrete. That's right, But that's all the rage very trendy, and of course the compact fluorescent light bulb controversial. Yeah, it's it's become a source of um. Well, it's become a poster boy for cynics of um the ability of one person to make any kind of change all they can you want to stat Yeah, well, a lot of people don't use them because they complain that it's not a warm uh bulb and it's very cold. Yeah, they've gotten a little bit better, they've gotten warmer. But let's say you're not a fan of it, don't necessarily think that you have to go all or nothing. If everyone in the country, if every household swapped out one bulb in their home, that would save enough energy to power three million homes for a year, prevent nine billion pounds of greenhouse gasses, which is the equivalent of eight hundred thousand cars running for a full year. If everyone did one one one bulbs alright, not bad, and they last a lot longer. They cost a little bit more, but you save about forty dollars per bulb over its lifetime because they last ten thousand hours compared to about eight hundred two thousand hours. And like I said, if you don't like the the white hue of the compact fluorescent. Just put one in a place in your house that you don't spend a ton of time in and pat yourself on the back that you did a little bit of good. Can you imagine being the poor sap West to stand there in time the fluorescent bulb? See how long it lasts? And for quality assurance, we're in a lab coach just staring at your watch for ten thousand straight hours? I wonder how ten hours? What does that break down to? How many days is that? Several? Several days? So that's all I got. It's greener to to renovate, it seems, as a rule, but within that there are things you can do to be even greener. Yeah, Or if you're gonna build from the ground up, there are ways to go about that to make it greener as well. Because again, technically, if you demolish your house and recycle all of it, yeah, or if or if you renovate and don't recycle anything, demolishing was a better choice. There was greener Chuck, what else you got? I got nothing? I got nothing either. Um diverting waste of the landfill. Yeah, we don't do the green thing alive. It's been a while. We like to touch these every now and then, and so we just touched it. It's been touched, and it touched us right there. If you want to learn more about all things green, Um, how stuff works had a an entire channel dedicated to green. It's a sub channel under science. Right, darn skippy. You can just type green into the handy search bar and that will bring up about fifteen thousand returns. Right since I said search far, it's time now for listener mail. Alright, listener mail, Josh. I got a couple of things here. I want a quick listener mail, and then another list of movies that you called for, um, little known or underappreciated movies. Yeah, some were quite as little known as yeah. I got a problem with a few of these. But first from Rachel um Hi, Chuck, Josh, and Jerry huge fan. You mentioned the snuggy inventor, and I wanted to share a little gossip. This is good. Actually, are you gonna read this? Really? I asked her, and she said go ahead, yeah, But are you gonna ask the snuggy inventor? I'm gonna say, allegedly through the whole thing, allegedly last weekend, my friend catered the Snuggy inventor's daughters bought mitzvah. Allegedly it was it some Trump country club, and Vanna was there, allegedly allegedly, it wasn't an Avana look alike. It was paid to be there. That's right. The event was Broadway themed and the daughter's face was photoshopped onto a bunch of Broadway banners like cats and Billy Elliott. I've been to a New York Broadway theme. Bought mitzvah before two really people with some dough Sure? Yeah, my friend worked to the martini bar and allegedly did not get a single tip. And that's the scoop from Rachel allegedly. And now little known movies are underappreciated movies. What was the exact call for overlooked, overlooked um attack Attack the gas station as a Korean film? I have not seen that. You have not seen that. We had like three or four people sending the movie being there, which I've heard it sounds familiar. Oh it's great, Peter Seller's how ask But it was not overlooked because it made thirty million dollars in nineteen seventy nine just pretty, and it was nominated for two Academy Awards, one of which one Best Supporting Actor. Maybe they mean like by the average person. I think that they kind of. I was specifically asking for movie suggestions for me, well being there. I saw Capturing the Freedman's Last Night. Have you seen that? Ye Oh my god, that movie. Man. The whole time, I was like, they did it, they didn't do it, they did it, they didn't do it. I just kicked back and watched and it was like, Wow, this is crazy. What do you think at the end? Did you think they did it or didn't do it? I don't think the Sun did it. I don't think either of them did it. I don't need I think the dad had. We should probably not spoil it for people. Yeah, I think the dad had definite issues, and he admitted as such. But I don't think he did it. And that he got caught for stuff you didn't get caught for. I meant he got what a great movie that? Yeah? It was documentary. UM one nice lady sent in the movie office space, not too terribly overlooked. It depends on the crowd you run with. I would imagine if you hang out, um, with both who play shuff shuffle board regularly. Yes, office Space may have been overlooked. It was overlooked in the theaters. It became a big hit on video, so you know what was overlooked at the in the theater. So um, that shouldn't have been looked at. It was Extract, his third movie. Yeah, that wasn't very good, terrible, but Idiocracy was awesome. I thought it was okay. It started to get a little old to me, didn't. Yeah, the premise sort of was like, all right, it's a one joke premise, and it got old. No, I thought he did well with a one joke premise. One thumbs up, one thumbs medium. The Last Waltz. Someone sent that in the excellent Martin Scorsese film about the band's last performance, which, how dare you? I've seen it like a hundred times. Um Alien Apocalypse starring the great great Bruce Campbell. Yeah, I've never heard of this one quack ser Fortune has a cousin in the Bronx. I looked this up and it sounds pretty good. Gene Wilder, Gene Wilder, you can't go wrong, Never can go Jean wild in nineteen seventy have you seen the Original Producers. I've only seemed like the first twenty minutes and it's hilarious. Yeah, it's great. Gene Wilder was the man the Proposition, which was an awesome, gritty western written by Nick Cave. Did you see that? Yeah? I did. That's the that's this one and only right the Guy Piers. Yeah, it's pretty Australian western. Yeah. I don't know if awesome is the right word. Like, it's pretty good. I liked it too, but I mean I was expecting more from it. I must say. Well, and since we're on the western thing, I'm gonna recommend um the the Jesse James movie that Brad Pitt was in The Assassination. Just yes, I have not seen that. Man, it is awesome. Um my western pick, Yes, ravenous. Yeah, Rabbins was great. Yeah, it was another Guy Piers movie. Jerry's like, hey, guys are going on and um, people like to hear this though. Um, someone recommended the movie Senecto Key, New York's Connectady. Yeah it's senecto key. Jerry said, true. Oh, well, it's a Greek word and it means I can't remember what it means, but it has to do with the play on the words Schenectady. So the Greek word means a play on words. Now, but I was gonna say that. I can't remember exactly what it means. But it's a really, really weird movie by Charlie Kaufman. And I thought it was Schenectady, okay. And Philip si Moore Hoffman, the great Phil Hoffman. Yeah, I saw him beside me in a car one time in l A. I think you've told that story. I don't have it. Well, let's hear that one. I just saw him at the car next meeting Christ little le Baron. You have told that story. No, I told the story about seeing uh John c Riley. Oh, and I'm confusing John Voight because of the Christ wrestle there. Um. Someone recommended Danny Boyle's sci fi movie Sunshine with that was awesome until it fell apart. Ah my god, I've never seen a movie unraveled more decidedly than that, And I've never been more disappointed and like into a movie and then disappointed by how it ended, because it was really great up to a point. Um. And then a movie called forty four inch Chest with the great Ray Winstone and the greater Ian McShane who was swear Engine on Deadwood and actually see the owner of the hotel. McShane was like the just the big dog in town or swearr Engine was. But Ray Winstone and McShane were also in Sexy Beast, which was yeah, yeah, and so when also sent in and I didn't write this down, but I'm glad I thought of it in Bruges with Colin Ferrell, Colin Farrell and Ray Winstone, which is an awesome, awesome movie. And then finally this was at the last minute, like right before we recorded a German film called Downfall, and I don't know anything about it, so I can't not recommend nor dissuade you from seeing that. You know what I want to see as soon as the Human Sun apede I've not seen. I've heard I saw a trailer for it. I really want to see it. It's awful And I guess, uh, if you have never seen Cats Live, go go all right, Chuck, that's it. Huh. Yeah, I mean that was a good ten minutes of movie.
