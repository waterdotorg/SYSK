I'm welcome to the podcast on Josh Clark is staff writer here at how Stuff Works dot Com. With me is my fellow staff writer, Charles W. Bryant. How are you, Chuck. I'm here, Josh. I'm feeling good. I'm glad to be here with you. I'm glad to hear to Chuck in Uh. I don't know if you know this or not, but as a special treat we are trying something new here on Stuff you should Know. What's that? We're actually running a language module, recorded language module subliminally for our listeners. So you out there in podcast language, just kick back, relax and prepared to learn Russian without lifting a finger. While Chuck and I talked about the topic of knife hunting, do you know anything about that? Yeah? No, good? See it's working already. Well, let me tell you about knife hunting, chuck. Okay, Arguably it's the fairest way to hunt. And this is based on an article I wrote is knife Hunting the Fairest Way to Hunt, which is pretty subjective, and I was a little worried about, you know, me bringing my own opinions into it because I don't hunt. True, but it's kind of an open and chuck cakes, if you asked me, well, maybe so. And luckily, though, there is a there's a principle out there among hunters and wildlife managers. It's called the principle of fair chase, right, that there needs to be a balance between um, the hunter and the prey. Yeah. I mean like you can go out and spend tens of thousands of dollars. You've got your a t V, You've got your really super duper camo, you've got your incredible scope in a deer exactly. There's you know, you can there there's a launder detergent that's that removes any odor whatsoever from you. You can put buck lur around, there's feeding says, There's all sorts of things you can do to an unsuspecting and well to raise your advantage to where it's it's not even sport any longer. It's just blood sport or target practice live animals. Right. Um, Now, the principle of fair chases you were saying, it's basically trying to strike a balance between the deer or whatever you're hunting. I guess it doesn't matter what you're hunting, you know. Um, so yeah, it applies across the board. And you can't give a deer gun, So no, you can't. And frankly, I think that would be a really bad idea. All we've done to them with our cars and with the hunters, right, don't give them cars or guns and we'll be fine. Right, What what fairer way to hunt is there than hunting with the knife? Right? I think that would be the only fair way to hunt that? Or bare hands? Yes, yeah, obviously bare hands going toe to toe with like a bear. Dude. Actually, you're at a disadvantage, you know, there's fair hair chase should be balanced in your favor at that point. And frankly, I mean probably all you're wearing is a loincloth, so everything's gonna hurt extra back a soiled loinecloth at that definitely. Um, so do you know much about knife hunting? Uh? Not personally from experience, but you know, I know you and I were talking about this a lot when you wrote the article. Um. One thing I did want to talk about first, though, was this thing you found about internet hunting, which thankfully was shut down soon after it started. But this is like the opposite spectrum, complete opposite. This guy in Texas launched a website where you could hunt remotely from your computer, and it was literally attached to a gun. You could you had a camera and you could look out on the wild range and see something, pan over to it with your mouse, click it, and the gun with fire. And lawmakers shut that down, you know too. It's sweet, thankfully, Yeah, which is I frankly applaud that. I mean, apparently it wasn't just animal rights people, hunters as well, like sportsmen's groups were like this has to go away, this can't be good, which is good to know. Yeah. So, so we've got internet hunting band. I don't think you're gonna see any any bands on knife hunting based on questions of fairness. No, it's mostly used for wild boar, yeah, which is kind of I mean, I don't. I'm no hunter, but I think that kind of cool. First, Yeah, well, I mean they're they're about they get up to fifty pounds six feet long. There was there was one that went around um on the internet and I actually went onto Snopes and it was verified there was one that was, um, I think eleven feet long, right, what that? What's the name of that one? They called it like, um Jurassic pork or something like that, and so I was like, obviously this is a fake. I went on the steps. They're like, no, we verified it was part of an a p article. Was a knife it wasn't. It was shot with a pistol, and it turned out that it had been a family pet that was sold to this hunting preserve like two days before the guy shot. But so we've got a knife hunting. And basically what it is is you you send dogs out to go run after some some hogs who hide in the brush and they are startled. They're generally tranquil and they're not aggressive towards humans, but if you started them, they will run, and when they start running, you want to kind of get in between them and wherever they think they're going. And when they get close and if you actually push this, you know, seven hundred pound board to the ground and stab it and stab it to death, and it still results in the death of an animal. But if we're talking about whether or not knife hunting is fair, then arguably it's a lot fairer than being up in that tree. Yeah. I would say, if you have the fortitude to leap from a bush on top of a seven hundred pound pig and stab it to death, then I'm not gonna get in your way, right. And there was this one hunt who actually uh and it happened in nineteen six with this guy in Florida who not only knife hunted, he used throwing knots. That was crazy. Yeah, it was crazy. I'll have to af forward you the link. It's pretty interesting. And while I'm forwarding to Chuck, you guys should go read is knife hunting the Fairest Way to Hunt?
