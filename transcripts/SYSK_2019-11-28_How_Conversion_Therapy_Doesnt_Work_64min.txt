Josh: Do do Do Do Do do do Well. You know what that bad trumpet means? We mean bad, I mean, you know, bad as in Miles Davis was bad. Oh yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, thank you. Uh. We're announcing our live show at our annual trip to San Francisco Sketch Fest. We're gonna be where We're going to be at the Castro Theater, are home away from home in San Francisco on Saturday, January that's right. And I'm doing my third ever movie Crush at Sketch Fest. And this is gonna be a nighttime usually do a mattinee, but this is the following day on Sunday, January nine, at eight pm. Uh, and it is going to be at Piano Fight on Taylor Street. And for all these you can get tickets at the sketch Fest website or you can learn about tickets at our home touring home on the web that is s y s K live dot com. Right, that's right, we'll see you guys there. Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck. Bryant. There's guest producer Josh over there. Don't be confused, everybody, there are more than one Josh in the world. It's nice to hear you finally admit that it's taking a long time, a lot of therapy. Hey, nice segue. It's like a short stuff. I'm like, let's get to it. Let's get going. Well, I have a c A to issue. You know what cracks me up as people who are still like, what does that mean? You figure it out? You can email eventually some people will uh yeah, So my c A is just a personal c A that I'm going to try and just disguise my disdain for this entire topic. But I might not do a great job about it. Well you've already shown your hands, all right, good, that's my c o A. Yeah, yeah, I don't think there's too many stuff. You should know listeners who are probably into this, yeah what. But part of the problem is, we'll see later in this episode. It's part of the problem with conversion therapies coverage in the media is that it has largely been fairly even handed and described as like this controversial therapy and not said, uh, this scam and this junk science fraud perpetrated by zealots super harmful. Yeah, yeah, so that's where that's where I am. You know. That stuck out to me too, that in the late nineties we'll talk about it, especially when it was treated even handedly, and it made me think like we should do an episode on that, like the like, should the media treat all sides of an issue equally? And if it does, does that just like perpetuate ignorance or if it doesn't, does that like support fascism? Like that's a hornessness. I really think we should do it sometimes it is. That's a good good call, Thank you, Charles. I don't know how we I mean, I guess I could be researched. Yeah, surely somebody's done a think piece on it and we can springboard off of you know, I think piece. That's right, that's what we do most of our research. Uh. This is from one of our great writers, Julia Layton, and she put this a lot of this stuff together for us. Yeah, she did a good job on this. So like the additional histories you found out though, Yeah, because this this so we will define it first and then we'll talk about some histories. But this stuff, um, goes back way further than you would think. But that what we're talking about today is called conversion therapy reperative therapy ex gay therapy, where um, reperative therapy is trademarked by the way we should say, well, you couldn't hear it, but under my breath and said more like t s it was. Yeah, it was trademarked by a psychologist named Joseph Gelosi. Yes sor um. So uh what conversion therapy is probably what we're gonna mostly call it though what it's what it is is it's an alleged psychological theory and practice that is based on the idea that all people are born heterosexual and because of certain um, certain events past traumas usually traumas typically but also um the family dynamics play a huge role. Um, people who would otherwise are meant to be heterosexual can be accidentally steered into homosexuality and therefore can be ex or purposefully steered back cured, yes, cured being gay, right back to the righteous land of heterosexuality. And as you can imagine that this is a very popular with the fundamentalist Christian and um, I mean like that's not even like a guess like it overtly is they've adopted and taken on X gay, the X gay movement as UM as basically one of the the what's it called in a temp pole A temp post, sure one of the planks and there in the Christian Rights Platform for Social Change. Oh, it is a and it was officially part of the two thousand sixteen Republican Party platform. Even what that's right, Well, the whole RNC, yeah, which has been called the platform has been called by far the most anti l g t b Q platform in the nation's history. I mean, yeah, that's a plank in the party's platform. That's pretty significant. Like they don't throw just anything in there. So um with the with with um the X gay movement and conversion therapy um. I saw it described at least back in the late nineties as a front in the culture war that's as strong and as significant as abortion. Like the the the Christian right in particular is has basically dedicated itself to stamping out gayness and by do by converting gay people to to straighten us. The problem is is there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that that is even possible, right, And the problem is when you try and stamp out gayness. That creates a good beat that you can dance to. It makes that sound, and they're like, no, no, no, no, no, stop stamping. I had actually I went to well should I say this? I don't sure? Why not? Because this is the truth. I went to a church camp once when I was a youth. Well I figured a story or two like that. They talked about, uh, stomping your feet to the music or whatever they're playing, and they literally said, don't alternate feet because that's too close to dancing. Wow right, Yeah, And these weren't like, uh, I mean, these are pretty mainstream Baptist church camps. It wasn't like I went to some snake handling thing. No, but I had a really good episode on that. Yeah, that was a good one. Said anyway, stomp your feet, everybody, just don't alternate so you stomp them both at once, because that's not just stomp one foot, just on your right foot. I was gonna say, that's just jumping lightly. Okay, So that's what we're talking about. Conversion therapy. And like I said it, um became part of the Christian rights kind of philosophy and part of their their culture war, their culture war they're fighting. Um. But it goes back way further than that then. I think it was the late nineties when the right kind of adopted it um. As a matter of fact, like into the nineteenth century, there were people who subscribed to this, but they were all psychologists. This is back of the time when you could be a ghost investigator and say I'm a psychologist. This is the times when you could say, you know, this cigar reminds you of your mother, you know what I'm saying. Uh, And you could be a psychologist. You could be a father of psychology at that point. Yeah, you dug up a great article from history dot com called k Conversion Therapy is Disturbing nineteenth century Origins by Aaron Blakemore and uh attribution check. Yeah, Well, Aaron wrote a great article and in it, um she talks about in eighteen nine this hypnosis. Well again in the days where you could be a hypnotist and be a legitimate scientist at the same time getting a stage shows or psychology. That's right, where's the money. But he was German, of course, and he claimed to have turned a gay man straight after forty five hypnosis sessions and some other therapies, and that's sort of the first evidence of what we would later call conversion therapy starting up, although I'm sure even before that people they probably didn't call it conversion therapy. But if you were an effeminate man, you are no doubt probably beaten by your parents and shunned by your community. Right. Um. I think one of the other things it's kind of a hallmark of this long tradition of converting people in from being gay to straight or trying to, is this idea that there's something wrong with you if you're gay, and that that idea can actually become hung up on the individual, the gay person, so that they actually do seek out help in becoming straight. But the problem is in seeking that help, they're going to be frustrated and they're ultimately probably going to be um, they're gonna have feelings of shame, guilt, inadequacy, that they're not capable of helping themselves, or something wrong with them why can't they just be straight? Kind of thing. And then if you're a minor and your parents are forcing this on you, that then that raises it a whole other um can of worm of ethical dilemmas. But even from the outset, there were probably people who sought out hypnotists and other psychologists for help. It wasn't just people walking around kidnapping gay people and taking him off the street and trying to convert them, right, It could have very well been some man that's like, wait a minute, I don't feel normal feelings because I'm looking at Joe out there in the field and things are happening, if you know what I mean. Doc, And they're like, well, come on in watching him swing that scythe take his sweaty shirt off, ring it over his face, that kind of thing, right, So just sit down and follow the wrist watch with your eyes or I guess the pocket watch would be a weird uh technique. But from that same history dot com article there uh she she talks about some of the early attempts, like with electro convulsive therapy Lobotomyes, I think we even talked about some of the lobotomy's episode and they would give you a lobotomy for anything. Oh sure, what about testicular transplantation, right, because that was a theory from a doctor, an interochronologist name Eugene Steinach who thought that your testicles were the root of the problem, Well a lot of people did. There was like you could have gay testicles literally and they would swap them out for straight ones, right, And there's no I could not find any evidence one way or the other that any of these testicular transplants worked or were successful. I don't think they were. But I didn't see anything that said like all failed or whatever. But like what happened and they just shrivel up and fall off or something? So what do you mean if it actually like medically took to the body or Yeah, that's what I mean. Okay, saying like did it convert them? Did it work? Yeah, that's the answer. But yeah, I didn't know that you could in the nineteen twenties testical transplant successfully. That's what I'm saying, Like, I surely, I mean at some point and we must have talked about this in the Michael Um Dylan episode. Um we talked about the I don't think it was but it wasn't a transplant. It was just a straight up removal an orchiact to me, I believe castration. So but at some point testicles have been transplanted onto a person successfully. When did that happens? My question? He probably did to a dog first. But I mean think about it, like, if it didn't work, well, sorry you're castrated now. Yeah. They probably didn't say sorry though, but we took your gay testicles. The heterosexual testicles just didn't pan out. But now you don't have any testicles, gay or otherwise. That's right. Some of the other awful techniques that they would use back in the day, um were chemicals that they might have to make you wretch and vomit when you look at, you know, pictures of people of the same sex. It's called covert sensitization. Yeah, or if you're cross dressing, maybe same thing, or look in a mirror and be discussed it with yourself and wretch and vomit. Yeah, I'm very sadly. If you have, say like a UM as someone you're in a relationship with that you love, they might show you a picture of that person and um carry out aversive therapy or aversive conditioning. Um, what's weird, As you said, these are these are things they used to carry out. From what I've seen, this stuff still goes on today, some of it. So what we're talking about though, back in the nineteenth and most of the first half or so of the twentieth century this was all like the domain of psychology. And then eventually gay psychologists and and other straight psychologists too. We're basically like, this is wrong, Like the science is not adding up. Um, this is just this is just incorrect. Yeah, there were medical doctors too though, wasn't just psychologists. So eventually, in nineteen seventy three, the American Psychological Association said, hey, big news, We're no longer going to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder. Right, And a certain part of the population went, yeah, it's nineteen seventy two. Why did it take this long? Right? Exactly? But that was a big deal, and at that point a psychology mostly abandoned the idea that being gay was a disorder of any kind, and therefore there was no point in researching how to cure someone of being gay, and so it turned its back on this whole history of um conversion conversion. But it didn't fully die away, and I believe starting in like the eighties, the Christian rights started to kind of pick up on it and kind of breathe new life into it again. That's right, I think we should take a break. Yeah, that's a robust and a half set up? Is that? Oh I thought we were already into it. Oh my gosh, it wasn't just a setup. You're right, we'll be right back shock alright. So let's talk a little bit about because there's a couple of a couple of schools of thought here, um, and I hesitate to one to call the one more bona fide. But you know, there's conversion therapy that can happen at a licensed therapist office. And there's conversion therapy that can happen in you know, somebody's basement or the basement of a church. I was going to see basement to yeah, or a room. Couldn't have to be a base, I know, but a basement makes it seem surely sinister. That's probably why I said it. Uh. So there are two sort of ways that can happen. We're gonna talk a little bit about the first way. Uh the patented way Reparative Therapy trademark by Joseph Nicolosi SR. That guy doesn't even get the Italian accent, man, And I don't blame me, he doesn't, which we should say, by the way. In July this year, Amazon stopped carrying his works on their website. Yeah, because they they considered them, um that they promoted fraud, that's right, which we'll get to. Yeah, which is interesting. But this guy is like a psychologist. Yeah, he's He's a trained psychologist who basically said I'm gonna take everything I learned and directed towards curing gay people of being gay. Yeah. I don't know much about do you know much about his religiosity or I think he was Jewish okay and born in Brooklyn from what I understand. I wrote a really really great um article, not a think piece, but a memoir in the American prospect Um from the American Prospector two twelve. Yeah, it's different by Gabriel Urana. Okay. Um, it's called my so called ex gay Life. It's definitely worth reading, but it's it's a great look at um conversion therapy, but also is like overlaid with his like personal experience with it. Okay. At any rate, his contention was that, like we said, um, you develop homosexuality or homosexual feelings at least because of a result of environmental conditions childhood traumash and they call it same sex attraction s s A, and that could stem in his opinion from a few different things. Desire for adventure, pure acceptance, uh, loneliness or boredom or curiosity, um approval or affection from males. And a lot of this is centered on men, although it's certainly women are have been involved in this as well. Yeah, we'll get to that. Yeah, but a lot of them are a lot of this over the years is making gay men straight. Oh, yeah, I see what you mean. Yeah, it's but it's not exclusive to that. Uh, general rebellion, which is pretty funny. And then uh, sexual molestation by another male, And I think that is a very like I think that the idea that that leads to being gay is very widespread in culture, well beyond the Christian rioter people who believe in conversion therapy, the idea that if you're sexually abused by a man or somebody of your same sex, you become gay, which is just wrong, but I think a lot of people still believe that. I know, that's what I thought when I was a kid. Yeah, that's right. I mean, it's not real, it's utterly wrong, but yeah, uh. And the whole basis of Nicolosi's theory, he takes back to a study from n called Demography of Sexual Orientation and Adolescence. And this was an actual study from the Journal Pediatrics that looked at patterns of sexual orientation high school students in Minnesota. And what they found out was that younger teens and Minnesota in this study, uh, we're more likely to express sexual confusion about their orientation when they were younger, and as they grew older, they were less confused about their sexual identity and orientation. Right. And that's a legit study. And I think that probably anyone who's ever been an early teenager in a late teenager can be like, that sounds about right, exactly you. But the extrapolation that Nicolosi did was what the problem is, right, So Nicolosi was saying, like, yes, that shows that like you're you're, you're in a dangerous place earlier on, and that if a couple of things happen in a certain way, you can be veered off of this natural path towards heterosexuality into homosexuality, right and also more dangerously that means we gotta get them while they're young. Right. So um. One of the other things that he's he really based his practice on was this family tria of a domineering over attendant mother, a passive detached father, and a sensitive child in kind of in um, that's a good one in that that um that triangle, like you would like almost certainly have a gay kid if somebody didn't intervene. So he decided like this was his career was intervening in that kind of stuff. But that in and of itself has never been proven to um create gay kids like that, Like whether you believe in conversion therapy or not, if you have a domineering mother and have some father and you're like a sensitive type who likes dolls, even doesn't mean you're gonna turn gay. This is the basis of that though, is that yes you will turn gay. And um still to this day this idea is allowed to live because science is never fully satisfied the question like are we born gay? Do we develop being gay? And it looks like it's on a pretty strong track towards a genetic basis of homosexuality, but it's still nothing's definitive, and so people can say, well, maybe we do develop you know, an adolescence you know, being gay or whatever, because science is not filled this void credet. Yeah, and the way Nicolosi. Will would write about this stuff and describe it as in a very sort of professional inaciost type way, where a casual reader, uh might say, well, this seems totally valid and above board. Yeah, Newsweek reader, yeah, or an OPRAH viewer, that's right. Um, this is uh, this is one of the things that I think. This is from one of his books. Um. And this is how he describes a relationship to from patient to therapists. The client has come to the therapist seeking assistance to reduce something distressing to him, and the RT psychotherapist agrees to share his professional experience and education to help the client meet his own goal. His own goal. The therapist enters into a collaborate relationship, agreeing to work with the client to reduce his unwanted attractions and explore his heterosexual potential, which again, it seems very innocuous. Uh. And and and there are plenty of cases where a grown man of his or woman of their own um volition goes and seeks this out. But what they don't say is what happens many times is apparent forces their young child to do this. So that's a big one. Yeah, that's a big one. In this Um, that American Prospect magazine. Uh, the author was like in his early teens when he went to Nicoloson's therapy. Um, but he said everybody else in the group was in there, like forties or fifties. So it's definitely both. But there's something here that's really important because, like you said, if you just read this stuff, it does sound innocuous. It's all very much based on things like cognitive behavioral therapy like stuff that works, which means that this works in a weird, twisted way, which we'll talk about, but not in the way it's ultimately meant to it. It's in a bent way. Yeah, I mean, do you want me to explain now? I feel like I should. I take issue with the word works at all. There are situations where it might prevent someone from acting on a homosexual impulse, That's what I mean. Yeah, but that doesn't change the nature of their sexuality. No, no, right, And ultimately preventing someone or training someone to not act on their sexuality is damaging in and of itself and causes all sorts of other problems. But maybe good enough for a really religious family, right you know. Yeah, Well that's what I read is that over time, as the Christian right adopted the idea of, you know, championing the ex gay movement, that part of that was accepting gay people who refrained from gay sex. So if you were like, I'm gay, I'm never going to be straight. I tried, but I don't have sex with men, but I won't being welcomed in church. Yeah. So I was saying, though, is with with Nicholoson's thing, that there's something fundamentally wrong with it, and that if somebody came to you and said, I'm tired of being white or black or Hispanic, I can't stand it. You wouldn't say, oh, well, let's figure out how to make you not black or white or hispanic or straight. Let's figure out how to change you. They would say. Any therapists worth their salt would say, well, no, there's a lot of great things about being white or black, or Hispanic or straight, and let's focus on that so that you can own your identity, the like conversion therapy does. The opposite says, yes, let's figure out how to get the gay out of you. Let's change your identity because this group of society has said that it's unacceptable and that is an extraordinarily damaging position to come from, and that is the basis of conversion therapy. Yeah, and as we'll see later on the a m a's official stance is that it is and we'll read the quote later, that it is a damage ng prospect right and and creates real harm an American prospector. So this approach by Nicolosi um has four steps to it. The first one is interesting because it's the disclosure of the therapist personal, professional, philosophical and religious views on homosexuality, which includes Nicolosi says, uh, the gay affirmative therapist also discloses his philosophical views to the client. But from a gay affirmative perspective, does he just put that in there to like cover his baces. No, it's true though, because you wouldn't send your your son or daughter to a gay affirmative therapist to convert them into right. And I think this is what he's saying. You've been to therapy before, right, Sure? Have you ever noticed that when you first your first session, the therapist tells you a lot about themselves and what they think about mental health or life or whatever. Yeah, And I'm always like, wait to what about my problems. So we were talking about me, I'm getting charge for this. I don't care about your family. Um right, Uh, that's what he's saying that they do. But because this is about being gay, that's what they're going to talk about, their views or whatever. Interesting They're going to share their opinions of it, and that they think that there's problems with it. You know what my line is at the therapist when they do all that stuff. My great, that's really interesting at the end, and like you want to start the clock now right? Nice? Either that or I can pro rate. Uh. Number two of the four steps is encouragement of the client's inquiry, so basically asking the client the questions, examining their feelings um to try and discover like what lies beneath Number three, resolution of past trauma if it is, in fact one of the reasons they suspect this person has has gone down the road to homosexuality. And then UM education regarding features of homosexuality, which includes everything from what motivates you to do this? Two? You know that if you are gay, then this lifestyle ends in a very bad way for you, right that there's a lot of physical harm, social harm, emotional harm, yeah. So what's weird though, is like I can't Nicholas. He is like a tough person to paint with just one brush. Even though I totally disagree with what he did, A created dedicated his career too. He doesn't seem, at least from what I've read in including that American Prospect article from somebody who was a patient of his for years, he doesn't seem to have been like any sort of evil man or anything like that. Um. I I don't know if he just thought like this was a real thing and he was really helping what But for example, there's this one quote from from Gabriel Arianna who said that um, he had been like experimenting with um sexual encounters with other men as a teenager. And he said that he'd been meeting men off of the internet and he told Nicolosi like he's like, I trusted the guy enough to share this in therapy, and he said that Nicolosi told he said, he told me to be careful meeting men off the internet, but that I shouldn't dwell on it or feel guilty. He said my sexual behavior was of secondary importance if I understood myself and worked on my relationships with men, the attractions would take care of themselves. I just had to be patient, which is I mean, that's a pretty great thing for a therapist to tell a patient. Don't dwell on it, you know, don't feel guilty, just you know, except it, move on and learn from it or whatever. But then the second part, that's why, And so the thing is with conversion therapy in most cases, Nicolosi is like he's almost a shining example in a weird way, whereas other people associated with it are It's very easy to paint them with just one brush, you know. So we should talk a little bit about the argument against, a little bit more about the argument against, which includes a little bit more history. Um. You know, we talked about the earliest stages of conversion therapy in the late eighteen hundreds, but uh, it really kind of picked up steam in the United States in the nineteen sixties. Uh, when the Civil rights movement, you know, when gay people started coming out of the closet more, presenting themselves more in public, um, gay bars, popping up, things like that Stonewall stonewall of course, Uh, which you know, anytime something like that is becoming a little more accepted in the mainstream, there's gonna be another side that really roots down and digs in. And that's sort of how the modern gay conversion therapy movement was born, was out of homosexuality becoming more accepted. Yeah. I read a really interesting journal article, UM from two thousand and seven by Robinson and Spivey. It was in Gender and Society the journal, and UM they based really they they looked into the ex gay movement, not necessarily the psycho the psychology communities basis of it, but the later on the adoption of it by the Christian right. And they explained why the Christian right would be interested in that, and they were interested in it and dug in, like you said, because they saw homosexuality and feminism in particular as signs of a decadent society that would eventually cause us to crumble and collapse. And that the the And this is according to Um Robinson inspired. I haven't actually interviewed anyone on the Christian right who believes this, but they are academics and this was a pure view journal UM that the that masculinity is the antidote to that, it's the antidote to homosexuality. It's the antidote to feminism, and that it was up to each man to be a strong leader among women and children and to be as masculine as possible. That's how you how you did that? Yeah, I mean I I went. I heard sermons every Sunday, well not every Sunday, but I heard sermons on many Sundays where uh they were still saying wives submit to your husband's um straight out of the Bible, um, you know. Yeah. And and like most of the antidote is dad's you're being way too passive. You need to step up and be the leader of your family. But also moms you can help by saying, oh, you have a question, ask your father. I defer to your father. Go ask your father. And just yeah, being passive. Well, which goes back to the that triad you mentioned earlier about the domineering mother, the passive father equals gaps. That's basically the basis of the whole thing. From what I could tell is that at least among the Christian right, that that if if the father is not the dominant, in in leading figure in the family, that's where the trouble comes from, and that can produce homosexual children. Interesting, Yes, so something we we failed to mention as part of the A M A s uh change in ninety two, or was that the A p A A p A um was they said, And this is an important distinction, is that homosexuality they deemed a normal variation, not deviation, but a variation in human sexual orientation, and like other normal sexual orientations, can't be changed. In other words, you can't make a straight person gay anymore than you can make a gay person straight, is what that equals. And because of that, as we'll see you later on, that became the basis for this idea that conversion therapy is um in essence of fraud, right, because it purports to do something that can't be done. That's right. Should we take another break? Oh? Man, really, they're coming hard and fast like men's swinging sides and sweaty shirts on the field. Uh yeah, let's take another break and we'll talk about what might happen in conversion therapy right after that. Soosh and shock. Alright, Chuck, I'm excited about this part. You're excited about the horror show of Persian therapy. It's not all horror shows. Some of it is just alright laughable. Yeah, so uh statistically. Also also, I'm sorry everybody. I want to say something too. We typically try to be super objective. This one is very tough. We have science on our side too. This was really hard for me to research. Nothing is ever hard for me to research. This one was. It was like turning over a log and finding it like Maggot's writhing underneath. That was what researching When this one was like, I just kept putting it off and just keep leaving it and just going and watching like the Office or something like that. Just anything but researching this because it's super sad. It is it's that that children are taking at their most vulnerable time and adolescence, when they don't know what's going on, and they're told that there wrong and they're sinning and their dirty that is That is a part of why it's sad. Another part to me of why it's sad is that the idea that grown ups would direct this much thought and attention and effort into well slamming their head up against a wall to try to change someone else to a way they think they should be. That that, I think is um that that's that's at least as sad to me is your children being misdirected like this, because the kid can go on and grow up and be like, jeez, my family was super messed up. I'm really glad I don't speak to them anymore because I'm much happier over year. Right. Um, Well, that can happen in the ideal circumstances or the ideal circumstances that the family is just like, hey, we're really screwed up, We're really sorry. We love you no matter who you are. But the idea that there's a group, a social movement dedicated to just eradicating another group of people, that I find that very hard to swallow. Yeah, agreed. So apparently statistically about or close to seven hundred thousand people in the United States have undergone conversion therapy, and we should mention that, Uh, it's a real problem in places like Africa and Asia and South America where you can still be imprisoned for being gay, like Uganda is a big, a big place for that. Conversion therapy is like on the rise in those places and other places. But we're talking about the United States in this case seven hundred thousand people. Um, And like we said, sometimes it is in the with a license therapists sometimes it's uh done by a religious advisor, uh in a basement or at a church that you know what that reminded me of is another thing we need to talk about. Sometimes exorcisms, like church exercisms. We've done exorcism. We did like straight up Roman Catholic exorcism. Okay, I'm talking like the kind that somebody does in the basement of their house because they're supposedly an exorcist or something like that. Sure back door exorcism, basically black market. You'll see, you'll be like, oh man, we should be talking about this, all right. Well I agree already, I trust you so. Uh. The A m A says that conversion therapy programs may utilize harmful psychological techniques. Um. We were talking earlier about aversion therapy. Uh. And given chemicals, they can still be given um noxious stimulus. And I didn't see exactly what that entailed or could entail. There was a guy named Robert Gilbraith Heath who was the father of implanting electrodes into the brain to deliver shocks, and one of the things he directed that towards was curing gay people. I don't think anyone in their basement is implanning electrodes or whatever. But there are things like um uh, giving people like nauseamit nausea inducing medications is one showing them pictures that might nauseate them and then figure out how to associate that with masturbating the thoughts of other men or something like that. Yeah, I mean we should talk about a few of these specifically. I mean all you have to do is, uh, look up on a search engine conversion therapy horror stories, and there are plenty of people out there saying what happened to them. Yeah, look up also conversion therapy, super happy fun stories, and you're going to come back with almost nothing Google zero results. Uh. There was one teenager who said that he was forced to wear a backpack with forty pounds of rocks eighteen hours a day to just signify the physical burden of being at One person's family gave them a fake funeral, close casket funeral in front of him, where they said that he died of aids and they said their final goodbyes because he went down the sinful path, pretending he wasn't there, like that he was dead and in the casket, Yes, talking about him in third person. That's right, um, his family. One reporter being told to strip naked in front of a mirror, uh and say disparaging things about themselves. I just do that normally, though. Well. I did read one account where they basically said the whole idea is to break you down to nothing in the worst way possible and then build you back up again and in the image that they want. So I get the impression that that is one route, but that is not necessarily what you're going to get at any place you go for conversion therapy. There are other ones that say that's the problem is we don't know because so many people don't talk about it. Um. There's some that that like you would go to that say okay, we're not gonna abuse you or anything like that. But the base of our beliefs in this is that you you are gay because either you had an absent father, a dominating mother, some combination of the two, or you always like wanted to be like loved and you know, popular among your male peers, and you didn't get that. So now you are misdirecting this need, this unmet need, toward having anonymous gay sex on the dance floor with some dude in Miami or whatever. Um, so we need to figure out how to meet that need and have you hang out with guys who will tell you how cool you are and how popular you are, like tailgating or something kind of. And while we're at it, we're gonna do that by by excending the masculinity. We're gonna teach you how to be masculine so that you can't hang out with dudes in the real world and they will think you're cool. So things like, um, we're gonna teach you how to change the oil in your car. We're gonna teach you to sit without crossing your legs, no joke. Um, there was a guy who teach a man spread on the subway. There's a guy who's kind of a prominent thinker. Uh, I think he was. I saw him as a sexologist, maybe a Christian sexologist. Gerhardt van den Ardluig. It's pretty great. I think I nailed it. He said that, um, homosexual men need to unlearn avoidance of getting their hands dirty doing man manual work like chopping wood, painting a house using a shovel, and that I say no thanks to all three chopped wood. That's kind of fun. It is fun, and that not necessarily just here's an axe, start chopping wood. You're gonna just suddenly become cured. But that that is part of it. And in this thought, this tech where they're not abusing you, they're not degrading you or anything like that, they're teaching you masculinity and manliness. That the ultimate aim and goal of that is to go get married and have a kid or kids, right, And that that is a a big part of conversion therapy. It was for a very long time, was saying you might still be gay or whatever, but you're not really gay. You're now married and you have a kid, and that is what you're dedicating yourself. That's right. You're a wood chopping, football throwing dude with a pencil than mustache. Oh no, no, not that. So in nineteen seventy four, we should talk about George Wreckers. He was a psychologist who uh, who tested um whether or not this was an effective treatment, and uh, he had a four He this wasn't his boy, but this was his His client was a foreigner, I guess clients a weird way to put it. This child was forced to go to this person at four and a half years old, and this is a boy manifesting quote childhood a cross ginger identity. And they said this is based on the clothes, uh, that this boy wears. UM. And now, of course looking at this, it was probably a transgender child yeah, or gender fluid. Yeah. I mean it's hard to tell because this and the way they wrote about it, it's hard to kind of piece it together. Yeah. And it's also like, just how much of this behavior did this child exhibit? Like it makes it makes it seem like this is all the kid did was act like a girl when he was a boy. What else was he into? What else? You know, It's just such a narrow picture of the subject. Of course. So in the end, records Um did something super damaging. He trained the boy's mother to be the therapist, Like, here's what you need to do so this kid can get therapy from you, and basically punished feminine behaviors reinforce masculine behaviors, uh at all times. And they said that, hey, this is working because every time this boy gets punished for doing something feminine, he stops and like chops wood or throws the football and gets a reward. So because he's four and a half years old. He's doing the things that their parents congrat elate him for and reward him for, and not doing the things that he's getting punished for. And exactly punishment is what stood out to me. It's just so sad that the mother was instructed to reject him, to basically ignore him when he acted like a girl, but not ignore him like pretend it's not going on, like let him know that she is giving him the cold shoulder and that that's how he learned um. And it's just devastated. It's heartbreaking. And what's heartbreaking is this is used, was was used as an example like see this works. This four and a half year old is now acting more masculine and is not going to grow up to be gay. And uh this this child died by suicide at the age of thirty. Like that's the end result of this road. That's where it ends up. And that's what I meant earlier when I said, like it does kind of work because it follows psychological techniques that actually work, but it works in like kind of a bent way where yes, you can train somebody, You can mold a four year old to behave in a certain way by conditioning them it's posable. You can get somebody to do just about anything like that. But the ramifications, the results, the damage to the individual's identity that will eventually come out later are widespread and sweeping. And that's the point. That's why you shouldn't monkey around with somebody's identity using proven psychological techniques. That's what's so evil about the whole thing. Yeah, I mean, my daughter's forn to have had a hard time even getting through this stuff. And then also if somebody this is the other thing too, if you're a conversion therapy advocate or activist or practitioner, and that you say, no, there are people out there who are distressed, who are experiencing psychological distress for being gay. Yes, that's true. I guarantee that there are people like that out there, But directing them towards working on not being gay is not the answer. Go to regular therapy and learn to love that you're gay, and go find a church that accepts gay people. Their step two, because they're out there. Um, let's talk about the science of it, because to a decadent society. In two thousand nine, there was a report from the a p A Task Force on Appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation. Quite a read, and um, this was the actual final stance was sexual orientation change efforts can pose critical health risks to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Critical health risks, not emotional not I mean it's part of emotional health too, but critical health health risks. And if you read the the review of research and peer reviewed literature and the findings of what it can result in, it reads like the worst pharma ad disclaiming you've ever heard. Uh. Depression, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, shame, self hatred, hostility, dehumanization, betrayal, uh, social withdrawal, substance abuse, stress, sexual dysfunction, loss of faith, and suicidality. Uh. And on that last note, homosexual teens attempts suicide more often than heterosexual teens. And then among those homosexual teens, you're twice as likely to try that if your parents have rejected you, and three times as likely if you have undergone conversion therapy. Three times as likely, yes, compared to a heterosexual team. That's right, Well, you have it. That was just the A P A. That a bunch of different associations like legit medical and psychological associations have come out and condemned in no uncertain terms conversion therapy and all of their These condemnations basically follow two different texts. One, there is no science backing up the idea that you can change somebody from homosexuality to heterosexuality. And number two, there is science backing up the idea that trying to do that causes damage to the individual, So don't do that. And as a matter of fact, some some countries and um states in the United States have said, we're this is outlawed. You can't do this anymore everybody, which is really touchy stuff because again, the Christian right kind of adopted it, and um and we don't we don't really infringe on religious beliefs. But that's how strong these condemnations have been that they're saying, we'll kind of start to wade into that with this one. Yeah, and we'll we'll talk about the legalities of recent years in a sect. But before that, between the seventies and the A p a S stance changing things a little bit. Then through the eighties and nineties, where conversion therapy was really sort of hitting its peak, I think in America, there were a lot of there were a few high profile cases that were exposed that have helped sway things a little bit back to sanity. So first they were more recent years. Yeah, so before those high profile cases, and I mean right before him, I think, in a coalition of church groups got together and sponsored uh an ad campaign, something like a six thousand dollar ad campaign, and things like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times all this and these. This ad featured John and and I believe Anne Paulk, both of whom were formerly gay but were now ex gay. And Mary did and had a kid and said gay conversion helps. And at the time, there wasn't a lot of inc on the other side saying actually this is totally discredited. And it captured everybody's attention. And this was when the Christian wright came in and said we're gonna make this huge push in the culture war, and it really worked. That's when that Newsweek story came out. Yeah, they were on the cover of Newsweek. He was the he was a leader of an ex gay organization called Exodus International. John Pauk was right, and it brought a lot of poster boy yes and in x that this international in particular became one of two main umbrella organizations. They were kind of like the this I saw it put um the spiritual version of this, the ex Gay movement, and then something called NARTH the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, was like the scientific branch of the ex gay movement and um so Exodus International became a very well known prominent organization in the late nineties, but within two three years it would be it would basically be the poster child for how conversion therapy doesn't work right because John Paulk is gay. In two thousand, just two years later, he was uh photographed coming out of a gay bar in Washington, d C. At the time, he refuted that he didn't refute to do was there? He said, what you always say, I didn't know it was a gay bar. I went in there asking for directions. I saw he went into use the bath room, So either way, I just read the article. And then they were like, but you're in there for a couple of hours. Did you get the directions and use the bathroom? He clearly says blue Oyster in neon. Have you not seen the Police Academy movies? That was the name of it. In the Police Academy, right the Blue Oyster bar uh and John Pauk we we should say, now lives life as a gay man and is a chef. He's been on like some celebrity chef shows and he is, uh living his best life. He's living his best life from from what it looks like. So he's no longer married any longer to Anne. Actually that I don't know, because there are some well we'll keep going. I don't think he is, but um, there are a couple of people that are. There was in two thousand three Michael Johnston. Uh. He was another person touted as an ex gay success story, founder of National Coming Out of Homosexuality A. Uh, he actually was. He was found out to be having sex with men that he met online and uh infected them with HIV. Very big deal. And then there's Ted Haggard of course in two thousand six. Yeah, he was a preacher um and president of the National Association of Evangelicals, or was at the time, I guess very much an anti gay leader in in the religious circles. And this one sort of unfolded little by little, like m Hey, this guy came out and said this guy had a relationship with me for like three years. We did crystal meth together. And then Haggard came out and said, you know what I have to admit. I said, I bought crystal meth, but I didn't use it. I threw it in the trash because I wouldn't succumb to the sin. Did everybody said, yeah, he says he did buy crystal meth, and because I assumed there was proof and he said that he didn't use it at all. He threw it in the trash before he used it. Were the other guy was like, no, we did tons of meth and head gay sex a lot. He said, I know he's talking about. I'm like day four of us staying up. He like freaked out and threw it in the trash, but then he went back and got it. Uh. And the proof was that he paid for it by check. Maybe no, no, probably not. I don't think meth dealers take checks anymore anything. Uh. And then that was he was outed by a having a relationship with an underage boy, a sexual relationship. This is Ted Haggard again. Yeah, and the boy sued and it was settled by the church with a dollar figure. I think it's like a hundred and eighty grand and then finally in two thousand eleven, Ted Haggard comes out and it's like, all right, so I did have a relationship with a boy, but we never touched each other. I just masturbated in front of him. And in thousand eleven he said, you know what, I'm bisexual. I'm gonna admit it. I am bisexual, but I am going to choose to live my life as a faithful heterosexual husband to my wife. I wonder if after he admitted that, um it came out as bisexual, what that felt like, if he felt like a weight was lifted, or if the anxiety associated with it was just so much, or you know what his wife knew or didn't know or thought about it. It would be very curious to know what that. You know, what life has been like for him after that. I mean, he's a preacher again, because I mean, more power to him. If he's like, I'm a Christian and I'm just not going to have gay sex, that that's as much a personal choice as having gay sex, you know. I mean, the whole underage boy thing, that's a huge problem that I think I'm hoping was addressed. But I wonder what his what his life is like now? Oh, I mean he's like I said, he's preaching again. I think in Colorado. He's probably a stuff you should know. Listener Haggard right in, we'd like to hear from me, sir, Uh, you want to talk about the law, because right now there was one more chuck, there's a big one, Alan Chambers. Yes. So John Pulk when he was out at cruising the Blue Oyster in DC back in two thousand, he was running Exodus International. Uh. He was replaced a couple of years later by Alan Chambers, And about a decade after Chambers took over Exodus International, he said, I'm gay, I've been gay. Conversion therapy doesn't work. We're shutting down Exodus International, and I apologize to the l g tb Q community. Yes. So, within about a decade or so of the Christian Right adopting the ex gay and conversion therapy pillar post as part of the platform for their Culture War, UM, the biggest organization, one of two biggest organizations dedicated to conversion therapy said it doesn't work. We're sorry gay people for all the damage we've done. That's a pretty big turn of events. So, yes, it's still continues. So that led to Yeah, so that led to a bunch of laws that trying to keep it from continuing. Yeah, And the laws are basically usually around miners, saying you cannot force a minor to do something like this, not Hey, the whole thing is outlawed. If you're an adult and you want to go do this, then that's up to you. As of two thousand nineteen, this year, eighteen states in Washington, d C. And Puerto Rico have similar bands enacted. UM. And also it's important to point out that those bands are about the legitimate scientific community, Like you will have your licensere vote doesn't say anything about a preacher that you go to, or a youth counselor or any you know, sort of non licensed church there. It's only scientists or licensed count counselors or psychologists or psychiatrists or doctors. I'm sure who can lose their license if they practice, that's right. But yeah, that's that's because there's religious freedom. It's UM. I guess if you can still do that to miners though, if if it's a religious group doing it, that is what I'm not sure about. So for them, it depends on the state. So there was a group or there was a counseling UM organization called Jonah and Jonah Goldberd and Burke. Yes, they ran JONAH, which stood for I can't find it anywhere, I gotta hear Jews offering a new alternative for healing. Okay UM. They were not only found practicing in New Jersey UM conversion therapy, so they both lost their licenses. They were also sued in a civil suit by former patients for fraud and lost. It's interesting if you think about it, Wait a minute, if this is not possible, you're charging people for it. So they had like a three and a half million dollar settlement levity against them, but and lost their licenses. But then they just set up shop under another name, apparently the same year of the verdict in the civil suit. But for the most part, if you're a state and you pass a law banning conversion therapy to minors among medical practitioners or counselors UM, the courts are going to uphold that law. Yeah, it's been upheld in California, New Jersey. Most of the challenges are on the grounds of free speech UM and the New Jersey UH when they upheld the New Jersey or maybe it was Maryland. The judge said, uh, we're not infringing on your free speech. You can say whatever you want, but you can't practice this therapy. That's different than free speech. You can believe what you want, to say what you want, but you can't do this as part of your licensed therapy. It's the same thing as like if you UM, if you carry out quack cancer treatments that is harmful, like you're poisoning your patients or whatever, and like they become UM they lose the use of their arms and legs because of a treatment that you gave them for cancer that the American Medical Association has specifically said is damaging and harmful. You're totally going to get held accountable for that. You're lucky to just lose your license in that case. This is the exact same principle. So UM in because it deals mostly with miners, are exclusively with miners. The course of upheld it. But New York City actually is widely considered to have overstepped its bounds and actually misstepped in this kind of culture war about conversion therapy in banning the practice among miners and adults, and that got New York City sued, and New York City was like, well, the Supreme Court has actually gotten pretty conservative lately. I don't know if we should test this. And they repealed the band as a as a strategy right to keep it from getting tested in the Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court could say, no, all laws against conversion therapy are unconstitutional. You can outlawed or bandon in any form. Yeah, and I think the Supreme Court already refused to hear one case which actually upheld the state's outlaw of right conversion therapy. Yeah. Very interesting. There's a movie I haven't seen yet called The Miseducation of Camera and Post. It's a two thousand eighteen film from the two thousand and twelve novel by Emily dan F. Haven't seen it yet, but it's about a girl who undergoes conversion therapy. And it's uh, Chloe Grace Mortz Moritz. I you know her, I do. I can't put the face with the name, but I know both. Yeah, you've seen her for sure. If you want to know more about arrested development, conversion therapy, all that stuff, you can, well, I guess start researching online. See what you think. And since I said, see what you think, it's time for listening to mail. I'm gonna call this complaint pedantic complaint. I right to complain. Josh the episode on historic districts, you kept referring to them repeatedly with the indefinite article and rather than A and historic district. I said, And that's what he says. That sounds unusual. I don't usually do that. Really, I guess I was just being unconsciously correct. So is that correct? Yeah? So what's the rule? I don't even know. Huh what I just said. That's the rule. That's the rule. What I say, Okay, I'm trying not to exercise it too much only when I'm right. Joe says this. I realized this infuriating practice has become popular in recent years in the US. I feel passionately that it must be discontinued, especially primarily by those voices are attended by large audiences like you. You know, are no doubt a where the letter H as a consonant necessitate, necessity necessitating geez, the use of the indefinite article A rather than an citation. All grammar books, ever, I should limit the scope of my gripe with an important caveat Cockney's. They should probably continue to say, and because they pronounced it historic. This guy doesn't even know that the rhyming slanging episode is coming out. How weird. But guys, that's not really right right today, I love the show. I wanted to tell you. I wanted to wait for a halfway plausible pretense to make the email a little more fun, which I hope this has been any chance on an episode of How Pedantry Works. Keep up the good work, Joe, He's spoken fun. It turns out he's good peeps after all. Yes, is the end before an age? Is that a thing? Oh? You know? That? Is it? Yeah? I think? Um. I don't know if it's proper or not, but I understand where it comes from because the vowel that comes right after the age is usually so heavily pronounced in relation to how it's pronounced when it comes after other consonants like an historic and historic district sounds and honor and honor a honor which one sounds better like I was bestowed in honor the other way? But you wouldn't say. In high school I had a history teacher that was great. It's really weird. Did Joe tell you to say that? No, I just thought of it because historic history teacher. I had a historic Yeah, both work, how about this? We're both right, Joe trying not to focus on such stupid stuff. I'm curious if there is I really want another rule now because I know it's a consonant. But if people are saying it these days, is that just some sort of a fighting the system. That's the descriptivist way. The prescriptivist is like, no, it's this way. Joe is the prescriptivist here, or descriptivists? All right. I think we've proven ourselves that maybe we should launch a side podcast called the Descriptivists. That's a good one, almost as like a Civil War era folk band field to it. We'd have the curly cues that one. That's fine, We're not going to do that. We could get fake ones that we just took on and offer publicity fils, right, scout mob all right.
