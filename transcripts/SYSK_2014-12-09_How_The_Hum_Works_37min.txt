Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant. And I would say it's stuff you should know, but it's not because I haven't said Jerry, and now I did, So this is stuffer. Yes, are people going crazy yet? I don't know. There's probably some people who started going crazy in the moment they hit play. Yeah, that's Chuck's version of the hum. Yeah, capital T, capital H. Yeah. So the home you just did it makes sense. It's a hum. But apparently, like if you'd listened, I don't. I wonder if you can hear the same thing I'm hearing because you're hearing it in your head. But there's like a gravelly quality to it, the vocal fry. Okay, if you want to call it that, I say gravel, but it's not. It wasn't constant. The gravelly thing gave it texture and it was kind of broken up a little bit. That is more akin to the hum than the unbroken part that was going throughout. Yeah. So apparently, while this is called the hum, and we should eventually explain what we're talking about, it's not the classical definition of a hum that people here, right, It's not it's it's it's like a diesel truck idling engine idling is with a classic description of it. Yeah, the um. That term vocal fry is one of those you ever hear or learn of a new expression or a thing and they've never heard of and then you see it everywhere that is called the bottom mine huff phenomenon. And that's happening to me with vocal fry. Where did you hear that? I can't remember where I initially heard it, But it's a thing now that they say um, like Kim Kardashian is who they always blame. It's a vocal affectation that's supposedly young women are using now where they go into a that lower tone um, that grably tone on certain like the ends of sentences. You I know you. I heard that too, and it supposedly keeps them from being promoted at work or something. Yeah. Yeah, And it's the female equivalent of the guys who speak up yeah, or all the valley girl thing, which is up speak, like the valley girls talking like that. But now it's um. You know, he was a nice guy. But I really wasn't sure what his motivation was. Oh, okay, yeah, that's a great interesting that's because it was dead on. Yeah, I totally got that you had pigtails just now. Yeah. I was talking Emily about it the other day. She was like, do I do that? It's like, now, you don't do that? No, you don't. I just did that, didn't I a little bit? But you you were doing a different voice, So it makes sense. Yeah, anyway, I can't escape it now. It's like every other day since i've heard it, I've seen something about vocal frying. And if you notice people with vocal frymore all the time, Okay, yeah, it's annoying. Like what you're describing now has really nothing to do with the hump, but it actually does have a lot in common with the hum in that kind of People who hear the hum um tended to be able to focus in on it more and more easily the more that they're exposed to it, which is the opposite of what should happen to a noise that really is inconsequential in the environment. That's right. So what we're talking about here, Chuck, is the hum with a capital H. That's right, what what is it? Well, it is um. It is a sound, a mysterious sound that is heard in places around the world by about two per cent of the local population. Um. It is a low frequent and we're going to get into the frequencies and all that, but let's just call it a low frequency rumbling right now. It's a drone. It's a vibration described sometimes as it sounds like it's coming from nowhere or inside my own head. Um. And it is. There are places all around the world where, like I said, a very small population of people experience this hum. And depending on where you are, they will name it that home like the Auckland hume, the wings are hum, the Bristol hume. Yeah, the Talos hum and um. It's been described, you know, going back to the eighteen hundreds. People have talked about it in literature, but really in the nineteen fifties, sixties and seventies in the modern world is when people have started describing hearing this thing that drives them batty basically, and one of the ways that it drives them batties. They'll say do you hear that? And everyone else in the room will say no. The people's yeah, and they'll be like, how do you what do you mean you don't hear that, and everybody else in the room goes, okay, right, maybe you're a little wacky. It is generally at night. It's worse at night, for sure, and generally in more rural areas. Um, which makes sense because it's not as much noise pollution, I think. Yeah. Um. It also is tends to be worse indoors, so at night, which is a little weird. Indoors means that you don't get much sleep because this is something that you can't not focus on. People who suffer from the hume tend to say that it dominates the soundscape. It's not something they can just tune out. It's not something that they're getting used to. And again, the more the more they're exposed to it, the easier they say it is to tune into it, and I guess become cognizant of it yet again, so imagine about it. Yeah, and imagine being plagued by a sound that does this to you and that everyone else says is not real because they don't hear it. Yeah, and it it's been I mean, we'll get into the reasons that it maybe or may not be happening, but it's been uh pass off as mass hysteria UM or mass dellusion UM from everything from that to like government conspiracy to uh legitimate legitimate noise, whether or not it's acoustic or electromagnetic. And that's part of the problem is is there one hum? There are lots of harms. Is there no harm? You know, your your skeptics will say there is no harm. It's tenatus or it's something like that UM or some other inner ear noise like odo acoustic noise UM. So who knows, but that's there. There are two ways that the hum. Okay, so again, let's let's restate this and let's put ourselves in the position of the outsider, because I don't experience them. So I am anced. I don't either knock on wood because the more I researched it some more I'm like, oh God, I hope I never do well. We we left out one um, one quality of it that that is common around the world. And when we say around the world, it tends to be curiously concentrated in the West um and in the euro I didn't notice that euro ancestry West. Yeah, I didn't really see anything about any countries in the East. If you look at UM, if you look at there is a guy who runs a m Glenn McPherson. Yes, Glenn McPherson runs something called the World HUM Map and Database. And we ran into Glen mic Ferson. Before we get too far, we should give a huge shout out to Jared Keller over at Mike who wrote this amazing article called a mysterious sound is driving people insane and nobody knows what's causing it. Totally worth reading UM. And he talks about a guy named Glenn McPherson who's a professor in UH British Columbia, and he set up a website called the World HUM Map and Database. And so anybody who hears the HUM can go and fill out a questionnaire and then it takes that data and puts a dot on the map, and you can hover over the dot and get the data. Right. If you look at it, it's just the United States, Great Britain, your Western Europe, Canada, South Africa. It's pretty it's it's unusual that there's nothing in Africa except South Africa. UM. And it's just in these European ancestry Western countries. Right. On the one hand, you could say, well, that's because this is an English language database, thanks, and so of course somebody whose native languages like Swahili isn't gonna go onto this. I have no idea what I'm typing here, but yeah, yeah, exactly. So that's one explanation. There are other explanations too, and now we arrive at one of them. We're going back on the outside because you don't hear the hump. I don't hear the hump. And let's say that we're your nose and throat guys, and somebody comes to us and says, I'm going crazy, like I'm seriously contemplating suicide because this hum is keeping me up at night. I haven't slept at weeks. I'm irritable, I have headaches, nose bleeds, I'm nauseated all the time. These are all common symptoms of HUM sufferers. You're you're gonna think one of two things as a doctor a physician. One is tonitus, yeah, and then the other one is you're crazy that you're you're driving yourself crazy. Um. Both of them can kind of be explained away, and they are explained away by this guy named David Demming, and he is a geoscientist from University of Oklahoma, and he wrote what is probably the definitive study on the harm so far back in two thousand four. That's right, So Demming apparently if you look at his research, there is another theory. Uh. And this is where the US government comes into play, because there's a couple of UM. There's a couple of theories revolving around the US military and whether or not they are causing this UM. One is with their High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program h a a ARP in Alaska and they transmit RF signals into the Hono sphere. And very well, we should we go ahead and start talking about the frequency ranges VLF and e l F. VLF is very low frequency and those are waves at point one hurts and the other one is e l F. Right, is there extremely low frequencies and they're in the range of UM the same amount of hurts, but their wavelength is up to like a hundred thousand meters. Right, that's an extremely long wavelength. That's right. And UM people who think, you know, they call them HUM investigators, Uh, they believe pretty much that it is VLF and e L f tones, UM, that are driving these people crazy, and those tones can drive you crazy. They do have adverse effects on the body. Um. You know you you probably heard it about a lot when it comes to like cell phone radiation that kind of thing. Yeah. But UM, whether or not E l F and VLF is or are the hum is what's a matter of much debate. It is matter of debate because and it's also kind of a matter of faith because what you're talking about there with UM E l F and vlf frequencies is uh tones. Those are radio waves and radio is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, right, So it has been shown at very very high frequencies, humans can detect electro magnetics sound. We take it as sound, which is weird because it's not supposed to happen like that, but that's how we experience it. It's not like at a high frequency we suddenly see it. We hear it. And if you are familiar with the UM comment six that the European Space Agency recently landed on, which is crazy, that comment was found to emit a an electromagnetic clicking sound, which is how we experience electromagnets or electromagnetic sound at a certain frequency, and so because it's a clicking sound, it's not a hum at all. Some people are saying, well, that doesn't make any sense. This is a hum. It doesn't if we can hear it, it's it's it doesn't sound like an idoling diesel engine. It sounds like a clicking sound or something like that. And then what's more, what this guy is saying is that if it's a very low frequency or extremely low frequency, that's the opposite of how we hear electromagnetic radiation. We heard a very high frequency, not a very low frequency. So which one is it. So, yes, it's still a huge matter of debate even as to whether the hum. First of all, if it does exist, if it's a single source, single source, and then um, if it is a single source or any kind of source, is it electromagnetic or is it acoustic? And we'll unpack the difference between those things right after this. So as whether or not the hum exist. The Canadian government actually part of the problem is it's hard to get research done on this because very small number of people experience it, and a lot of them are called crackpots. Yeah, so it's tough to get funding for research. But Luckily, there's a country called Canada that will fund things like this, and uh Dr Colin novak Um spent a year listening to the Windsor Home in Ontario, and what they found was the hum is real. And they traced the source in that case too um on the Michigan side of the Detroit River. UM and basically a steel plant on Zug Island. Then that sounds like an industrial plant, ily does, and it supposedly generates a lot of VLF waves UM when they're operating. So in this instance, at least the HUM was a real thing, and they found out it was a tone created from basically an industrial plant, right, So they apparently took steps to cut down on whatever energy it was emitting. Yeah, they turned off the HUM machine right exactly, and all of a sudden, um. Some people said, hey, that worked, a lot of people said that did absolutely nothing. The home's still out there. And then the most people said, I still don't know what you're talking about. So that that and that wasn't actually the first time government has looked into the hum. In Taos, New Mexico, there's something called the Taos Home and apparently, uh somebody wrote in to complain about it to a local newspaper, and all of a sudden, like hundreds more people said, yes, I hear the same thing. I've been hearing the same thing for years. What is going on? And enough of enough people said something in New Mexico that it prompted an investigation by the University of New Mexico and Sandy A Labs, which I think is like a government affiliated kind of Um, well, it's a neat research lab. They deal sorts of cool clandestine stuff, right, Um, very much so. And actually the X Files mentioned the hum and episode called Drive. Yeah. Interesting, they talk about it. There was a couple of characters had to constantly move westward or else they would suffer from the pressure of this hum that no one else could hear. Let me guess, Mulder believe Scully did not exactly how did you saw that one? No? I didn't, but you know, so, Um, they looked into the Taos hum and they could never figure out what it was, so I think they kind of wrote it off as either mass delusion or a bunch of people had tenitas or what have you, which is again, that's the that's the easy that's the easy answer. Like you have tonitas. The problem is if if a person has tenitas, they the sound is internal, like they remember. There's like the idea that the isn't it a high pitch ringing. Yes, usually it can. It can vary in in um and pitch, but for the most part it's you can tell it's internal with the hum. Everyone who experiences the hum says, no, this is external, and it's it's they're so convinced it's external that they'll go out at night when it's worse and try to find the source of it. They'll drive around their city or their neighborhood or walk around and look for what it is that's driving them crazy and they'll never find it, or they'll turn off the power of their house, or I mean, there's all sorts of extreme um, and of course it's all like anecdotal, but people that are driven to suicide or this one guy who intentionally deafened himself with a chainsaw, which I'm not sure how you do. I guess I think um and possibly even murder, which we'll get to in a bit, which is pretty interesting. But the point is that it's not just something that's just bugging people like it. It is having the hum. There are people all over the world that don't know each other, that have never met that, um, are suffering from something that they hear that other people can't hear in concentrated areas. Yeah, and then and that's the affecting their quality of life. And UM, I don't know if I ever finished the sentence, which is weird That means I'm really interested in something. But um, did we say or did I say that people who suffer from the hum tend to be in their fifties and older. Yeah, that's one of the markers between Okay, so there's a this is something in the favor of acoustic sound. Um. So, acoustic sound is a compression wave and it's something that's carried through and propagates through media. So um, there it's a vibration in the air. Whereas an electromagnetics wave comes from an electrical or a magnetic or both source. This is like the vibe vibration. It's a sound wave. That's that's an acoustic wave. Right. So, UM, as we age, say you get to around fifty years of age, your ability to hear high frequency and mid frequency acoustic sound diminishes. Your low frequency capabilities go undiminished, so it's not like they increase, but comparatively speaking, you get better at hearing low frequencies around age fifty. Interesting. So what some people think is that if it is electromagnetic, then there are some people out there who are capable of hearing electromagnetic waves while the rest of us can't and they're being driven crazy by some source that we have yet to identify. UM, or if it's acoustic, that there are some people out there who are superheroes of low frequency sound, which would also kind of um do away with another diagnosis that a lot of doctors give people, which is hyper accusus, which to me is worth a whole other podcast. It's another people kill themselves over this heightened hyper hearing, which where like this, the rustle of clothes is unbearable. The thing is is, if you have hyper accute, says, it's not just gonna be some home that you hear and everything else is normal, which is what hum sufferers experience. You would hear everything on this grand scale. You'd be like Spider Man exactly. So what they think is that there are people who UM are predisposed to hearing low frequency sounds way better than other people and that it comes as their higher and mid frequency capabilities diminished with age. But again, what are they hearing? Well, that's right, um. I mentioned earlier the h A A r P program that the US government military is doing in Alaska. The other one that I teased um is the TACAMO, the Take Charge and Move Out system. On the nineteen sixties, the U. S. Navy basically adopted this program to be able to U communicate with submarines, long range bombers UM ballistic missiles during nuclear war. And they use very low frequency radio waves to do so. And you know, it's a real thing, but is it the hum um? Other conspiracy theorists will say that the US government is also using these things to target individuals UM and of course that's you know, you want to say that's probably bunk, but you never know. Well, you know, what the cool irony is that Jared Keller points out is that if the HUM is electromagnetic in nature, tinfoil hat and aluminum foil hat would actually work because it blocks out about I write, but like just a thin layer of aluminum can block out like of electromagnetic waves. So that's pretty ironic that it might actually work. Although I don't I haven't heard whether that helps people with the hum, if they put on a tinfoil hat, if that would help or not, or if it has UM. But speaking of Tacomo, uh, if you read David Demming's UM journal article, it's called the hum and an homeless sound heard around the world. And there is a journal called the Journal of Scientific Exploration, which is a pure viewed scientific journal that accepts articles on things on the fringe of science, which the home most decidedly is UM. David demon gets into Tacomo and he basically says, this is a secret government program. So obviously we can't get any real answers. We don't know how often it works or how often they're transmitting or anything, but we do know it is a real thing. And he correlates some dates when there's like upgrades to the system and then all of a sudden in this one area around the same time there's the Kokomo Indiana home starts UM. So he he does a good job of correlating, and I think that's kind of what he settles on. He believes that it's probably the TACAMO program that this very low frequency transmission. Two submarines underwater from airplanes above is being propagated around the world, and that would suggest that it's a global so right, that it's just some people can hear these radio waves that you're not supposed to be able to hear. Yeah, or it's multiple sources combined, like a combined effect, like if you live near an industrial plant that has a machine that's making the sound that maybe certain people are retuned to or not. I don't know. Well, it's another characteristic is that it's mostly experienced in the country. Do see. I just chalk that up to noise pollution being red. Yeah. Like when I worked at a convenient store in the midnight shift the um. When I worked during the day, I would not notice anything, But when I worked up there at night at three am, I would hear the buzzing of the fluorescent lights and it would drive me crazy. Uh you know, I would turn them off and people would think we were closed. So you the thing is you eventually stopped hearing that, right, Well, when I left work. That's called habituation. So habituation means that you are capable of so like you'd focus on these things the whole time you were there. Well, yeah, in the middle, I wouldn't focus on it, but I would notice. I'd be reading a book and I would just hear that sound, you know, But I never noticed it during the day when the lights were on. But so like when you didn't hear it, that's habituation where like you're you're exposed to something, your brain says, uh, this is totally it's not a threat. I don't have to pay attention to it anymore. So anytime in this context that I hear that sound, I don't have to become cognizant of it. Now apparently you did. You kind of like fell into cognizance like here or there, and like you'd notice it again. But for a normal human being, when you're exposed to something like that over and over again, the less you notice it. But like we said with the hum the more you're exposed to it, the easier it is to tune in. And what that's called no, And not only can you not escape it, you can catch it easier and easier, Like you can become cognizant of it easier and easier the more you're exposed to it. It's called sensitization, where I guess another explanation for the Thus the suffers of the HUM if they are hearing something. One of the reasons that it drives them so baddy is because their habituation levels are low, but they're sensitive. Sensitization levels are high, so they're not able to ignore it, and some part of their brain is focusing in on and this creates this, I guess, a perfect storm of holaciousness. All right, Well, right after this break, Um, I did mention murder, So we're gonna talk about one of them more interesting parts of the effects of the HUM right after this. Alright, So I mentioned murder, like I said, and one of the things that UM. What is the guy's name, Steve Callaz. He's a mechanical He's a mechanical and near and HUM investigator in Connecticut, and I believe he was the one that traced UM the Windsor home to Zug Island and he has done UM some research that he believes the HAM and others believed the HAM could be responsible for UM well for killing other people. UH specifically in his case, he actually approached Connecticut State police investigators after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and he said the HUM from a nearby gas pipeline might have driven Adam Lanza two well have contributed to driving him to do something like this. And I don't think he's saying this made him crazy so he did this. I think he's saying, fragile minded people could be pushed over the edge. It could be the last straw for somebody. Um. And I don't know how much credence it has, but investigators did at least include that in the documents. They really to the public, so they thought it was worthy enough to put in, you know, among the seven thousand other documents to release to the public. And he's not the only one. Um. Remember the Navy Yard shooting in Aaron Alexis, he fully came out and said, um, quote, ultra low frequency attack is what I've been a subject to for the last three years, I'm sorry three months, and to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this end. Quote. And he scrawled and scratched e LF on the shotgun barrel that he used to kill twelve people at the Washington Navy Yard and he yeah, and he scratched my e l F weapon on the stock. I think yeah, And um, basically conspiracy theorists would say, well, this is clearly driving people to do things like this. Skeptics are gonna say, no, these people are delusional and they're the ones who believe the government is shooting them with these U. E. F tones and driving them crazy. But either way, it's a little startling that someone would scratch that in their shotgun before they did something like that and and blame it on that outright. But that that raises another point, like you know, how exposed was he to those conspiracy theories. Like a lot of people would say, well, there, you know, there's a Yahoo group dedicated to the HUM. There's that one world HUM map and database, and like people who go see these things, I mean, are they are they just suggestible and they're like, oh yeah, I can hear it. Yeah. Um. David Deming points out, like that's crazy. The idea that people are tuning into this thing that's having a really um diminishing effect on their well being as part of just a a mass delusion or something like that kind of goes against this. The typical psychology of mass delusion where people join crowds to be to get some sort of positive benefit or effect from it, and you can argue there get they're feeling a sense of inclusion or whatever by saying I hear the hum too, even in a very small minority. But apparently if you are a hum sufferer, like your life is screwed up and you're not a happy person. Yeah, I will say this. One thing I've noticed about conspiracy theorists is none of them ever believe one. Yeah. It seems like they believe a lot of them, you know. Uh, So that's all I have to say about that. Well, there's one other thing. So not only is this driving people crazy, there is evidence that if this does exist, if there is something that um if there's some sort of what's called low frequency noise that's in the environment, it is, it's everywhere, but if people are are being exposed to it, there's evidence that biologically speaking, it can have an impact. And they're just happened to be this incredible real world laboratory that's sprung up in Portugal in the late seventies because a guy named Caste Obronco was put in charge of the Portuguese Air Forces maintenance, repair and manufacturing plant. It's called ogma um or I don't I don't know Portuguese accent or else I do it. We'll just call it ogma UM. And he happened to just be sitting there and he watched a aircraft technician wander around aimlessly in what apparently looked a lot like an epileptic seizure to this doctor. And it was during in what's called an aircraft run up procedure where they're like going through all the systems, and this guy was just standing there and all of a sudden, he's wandering around. So he looked into it and found that ten of the workers at this aircraft repair shop were diagnosed with late onset epilepsy. And if you look at this population and compared to the population of Portugal at large, not you wouldn't expect ten percent to have it. You'd expect point to sent to have it. So the fact that there are a lot of people who are being diagnosed with this really um led them to believe that they were exposed to this low frequency noise or that it was having a dangerous effect on them. And this one guy who was a worker there got really interested in all this and he created a living will. His name was Phelippe Pedro and Phelippe Pedro was like, you cut me open the moment I die and doing autopsy, and they found this guy was messed up, like his his ajorda. His heart was thicken the walls were thickened inexplicably chi yeah pretty much. Um, but no, that would be explicable. So he was a very healthy person. Then apparently what they found doesn't jibe with his lifestyle he was. He was diagnosed with late onset epilepsy. He died at age fifty eight. Um. He had a thickened he had thickened heart tissue, he had a tumor and his kidney, he had a tumor in his liver. Um. And apparently, now thanks to this guy and his autopsy, he kind of like laid the groundwork for this investigation into low frequency noise being dangerous for humans. Even though we don't feel anything, but on a cellular level, being exposed to this stuff has these effects. UM. So apparently, if you have thickening of your heart tissue without any kind of inflammation response, um, that is a classic sign of low frequency noise damage. It's what's called uh fibro acoustic disease, which certain people may be susceptible to and others are not. In theory, supposedly, anyone exposed to it would be susceptible to it. The way that it ties into the HUM is some people might actually be able to hear what they're being exposed to, while while most people might not. So we're all exposed to it. Then. Yeah, the in this article, I can't remember the name of it, but it was it was basically an overview of this this um aircraft place by some Portuguese scientists. Um. They they said, it's almost impossible to get a control group to compare because everybody's exposed to low frequency noise, just most of us aren't aware of it. It's just everywhere, but it's not considered a nuisance except for that two to eleven of poor people who suffer from hearing the home and their accounts differ wildly as well. Uh So that's it's tough to study, and you can't get funding to study because it's French science unless you're in Canada. So they say, turn a fan on at night. Really that's what one guy does, makes sense, Yeah, turn on a fan or like some sort of like they need white noise to john it out and that helps. But get that up, get the white noise out. That's what I sleep to. Uh again, go read the awesome article by Jared Keller. Yeah, Life Science had a couple of good articles yeah. Um, and then David Demming has the Home and Anomalous Sound Heard round the World. Uh. And then if this kind of stuff floats your boat, you might want to check out some of our friends sites to Um, there's a great podcast by our friend Roman mars Ed Invisible, who would be able to explain a lot of the science behind this kind of thing. No, but it's kind of up his alley, like the vibro acoustic idea. I can totally see him getting into that. And I just think if somebody dug that, they dig n in Visible and then damn interesting. Another great site that would definitely have probably has something about the home on it. Yeah, and watch the X Files. Yeah right yeah, our pal molder. Uh. And of course you can um hang out at how stuff works. You can just type the home in. I don't think it'll bring up an article, but see what happens. Yeah, we don't have one yet, but yeah, type home into the search bar and see what comes up. It's just a fun game. And since I said the search bar. It's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call it this um limousine Ranch. Hey guys, I finally have a story for you after listening for over five years. I live in super rural South Dakota, not just the regular rural South Dakota. My town is only about people and it is the largest town within a hundred miles radius. The main business here is agriculture and ranching a big surprise. After I married my plumber husband from St. Louis, we moved back to my little hometown six years ago, where we started a plumbing business. He started plumbing business. Shortly after moving here, we got a call to go to Anderson's limousin ranch, limousine ranch with no E on the end. After driving out to the country and lots of gravel roads, later, he came up on the ranch and failed to see any limos He said he couldn't figure out where all the limousines were, uh, and why there would be a limousine company dealership in the middle of nowhere on an Indian reservation, I guess. He asked the owners and they splain that they run limousine cattle on their ranch, which I looked up. It's a type of cattle from the Limousine region of France. They don't look like they're wearing cloaks or anything. Now, my brother and I teased them for quite some time on this to get a mental image of the absurdity. Imagine the vast prairie of dances with wolves or Fargo, and then expect to see a limousine dealership out there. Um or just a bunch of limousines is kind of meandering around the field. That sounds like something that would happen in Fargo. That's very Cohen Brothers esque but not. Kevin Costner asking that he's pretty self serious. Yeah, he didn't look like he has much of us since humor Diousie, I don't know he was in Bull Durham. It's funny. Well, yeah, back in the day when he was Bible. I watched the preview only for that movie Draft Day that he did recently. Yeah, I can barely make it through the preview. The preview built it up. They were like, I can't believe he's doing it. Is he really going to do this? And it's about the NFL Draft and he's like a GM and they built it up to this thing, and finally I was. It was when it was in the movie theater the preview. I leaned over to my buddy Scotty, who you know, and I was like, like, what does he do? Does he like open fire on the room and like shoot people or is it just some sort of trade. It's a team. Yeah, but they were building up like I can't believe this is happening. Did you ever see the movie? No, what was Scott's take on it? He just laughed and said, yeah, exactly. That sounds like our Scott. That's he's the guy that laughs at things like that. Um, that is from Jennifer Coleman. Oh, I forgot we were even doing. Listen to the mail, that's right, Jennifer, And Um, you should tease your husband for that. That's pretty funny stuff. And he should stick to the plumbing business. Yeah for real, not the limousine company finding business. Uh. If you want to mock someone you love on our show, you can tweet to us at s Y s K podcast.
