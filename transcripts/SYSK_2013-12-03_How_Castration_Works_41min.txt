Josh: Brought to you by the all new Toyota Corolla. Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles Debuto, Bryant, Jerry's over there, and we all want to warn you that if you were squeamish, you should skip this one. And if you're a man, you may just sit there with your legs crossed the entire episode. Yeah, don't be confused. We're not talking about circumcision. We already did that one. This one's castration, and it is nothing like circumcision. Really. Uh And as a matter of fact, I'm pretty proud of our circumcision episode. That one was really good at head at All had history, anatomy um scalpels, controversy, controversy. That was a good one. This one's a little different. This is castration. It better not be anything like circumcision, because that means something has gone very wrong or you just haven't finished. Yeah, all right, yeah, castration. I don't remember how this came up, but this is from a bog post. I wrote, Hey, yeah, you did a great job. Yeah, well, I just wanted to find out everything there is to know about castration. I did pretty much. I've got a couple of historical bullet points for you. Okay, Um, Apparently in seventeen seventy eight, Thomas Jefferson introduced a bill reducing punishment for rape, polygamy, and sodomy from death to castration. Okay, t J. And you know, we should also point out we got a lot of letters from people about the revisionist history with Thomas Jefferson that said, you know, Sally Hemmings was more than likely forced into that relationship. And some people go so far as to call Thomas Jefferson a rapist himself for that relationship. And um, so I had never seen that, but then I did some reading, and that is a theory that we can't really base and say, hey, they were in love. Yeah, so are in love because they made love. I don't know that I'm going to go out and say that he was a rapist, but um, it's it's definitely some hinky history. Well that's a really excellent point. Like with revisionist history again, like a lot of its interpretation. But I mean, if you do look at it, like she was his slave and they had a relationship, Like how can it be consentual right at the very least, it's it's tarnished with the concept that she was a slave, and there's a chance that he forced her into it. So thanks for everyone who wrote in. Yeah. Um. And also the other quick thing is that Genghis Khan supposedly like says that Jingis might have been castrated himself by princess seeking revenge. I can't remember his name, Jingis, No, no Hang See or Hang Fee. I can't remember. He was like the admiral of the Chinese navy when they were undertaking basically their own age of exploration. That again named Gavin Menzies thinks beat Columbus too the New World in four he was castrated as well. There's actually been a lot of very prominent people in history who have held positions of great power who were castrated people. It's very interesting. Hadn't heard a Jengis though, Yeah, and that's you know, that's not verified. No, you can see that being like a rumor that his enemies made up to see make him seem weaker or something. Sure, but you know we should point out that. Um with this, with the concept of castration as as shocking and as weird, and horrific as it sounds, there is like a certain, um, certain group of people who are either castrated or interested in being castrated, that there's nothing really weird to it at all from their perspective. So, um, let's talk about this. This is not like a widespread thing today, but if you look back into the ancient world, um, it was actually fairly common, especially in parts of Asia like Korea and China. A lot of their high bureaucrats were actually castrated, and UM, like I said, a lot of them went on to hold great places of prominence in history. And very oddly, there's been some sort of um longevity research into the idea that if you're castrated mail, you may live longer than the average mail. Yeah. You found a study, uh from two thousand twelve from Korea that unix and that's the word you're gonna hear a lot. Um the subject group group produced more centenarians. That's people who live a hundred or older than UM a hundred and thirty times more than just normal folks in the West. And yeah, not say they're abnormal, but you know what I mean, well in their right and their average lifespan of that group was fourteen and nineteen years higher than the control group. Interesting. Um, the thing is that somebody pointed out like, well, they were high bureaucrats, so their life was cushier. They were less likely to be killed in an ox accident or something than their contemporaries. They're also less likely to die from a STD. Yeah. That's another really good point in that I hadn't thought about another study though that that um had similar findings too, though, so it is possible. The theory goes that without testostro in raging through your body, um, your lifespan could conceivably increase over time. That's true. Okay, So who else famous I know? Uh? Boston Corbett, Thomas Boston Corbett. Yeah, you said you knew about him already. I'm impressed I had heard this before. It might have been like a Jeopardy thing. Um. But he was the guy who most people believe shot John Wokes Booth, who shot Lincoln, and he was castrated himself. He castrated himself. He was a case of auto castration, and there aren't that many on record of auto castration. But um may I so, Mr orbit Um, you said he was the guy who shot John Wolkespooth against orders even Yeah, he was to be taken alive and this guy shot him. Yeah, I didn't know. It's disputed, but some people say he didn't do it. But um, I think he's largely held responsible. So later on in life, he uh, he became widowed. He was a widower, his wife died, is another way to put it. And he was worried about being tempted by other people, other women. So he one night took a pair of scissors and castrated himself, and then he went to church for the evening service, went home and had dinner, and then decided to go to the local doctor's house to see if it should get checked out. UM. That obviously made national news. One of the one of the ideas that UM suggests Corbett was crazy when he did this was that he was a hatter. That was his profession, and hatters at the time worked with mercury. Mercury, which the phrase mad as a hatter, the mad hatter. That's because people who made hats worked with mercury, and all of that mercury poisoning over time supposedly affected their personality and their i Q. What they did with the mercury. You know, I think it was had something to do with giving the head as shape. Okay, I'm not sure. I look, I looked for this and I couldn't find it. But I did find that that idea is in dispute. Um. Well, I did see that Corbett cited a Bible verse. Um, it's not surprising they went to church after Matthew nineteen twelve May. For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made so by man. And then there are also eunuchs who made themselves Unichs for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven. The one who was able to do this, let him do it. So there was another early church father who carried out auto castration because of that same Bible verse. So talking about in the Bible, if you're able to castrate yourself for the King of Heaven, just go ahead and do that. Right. There is a passage in the Bible that has led to at least two people cutting off their own genitalia. And this is New Testament, by the way. Yeah, I noticed the s Matthew, the supermodern. So. Um, the Corbett was nineteenth century. That's a fairly recent case. The early church father was obviously in the first couple of centuries a d and then the Korean eunuchs, although um they the the last one died in pretty recent Um, they were really operating in the more than nineteenth and early twentieth century, and then way you know, earlier in the millennia. But there are cases every once in a while, like an auto castration. Um, like every once in a while, like I think in two thousand six or something like that, I came across the case study of a person who castrated himself. Um. He was a twenty year old with what sounds like Cottard's delusion. He said that he had died and he was trying to wake himself up. That was one reason that he was awake. He also said he felt guilty for experiencing lust, and then overall he said he felt more female than male, but he was heterosexual. So it sounds like he was throwing everything at the wall to see what's stuck. But ultimately the thing that stuck out to me was he said he felt relief afterwards, like he was he was fine. His affect was flat, but he was fine. He wasn't like, oh my god, what have I done? And apparently he expressed relief at no longer having a sanitalia, which is something we'll get into it comes up later on. But the point is when he went into the hospital and doctors found out what he'd done to himself, they thought he was totally crazy, and a lot of people would. But it's really important to point out that with castration, it's typically auto castration that is deemed the results of psychosis, and it's not the castration part. It's the fact that you've harmed yourself. Yeah, just self mutilation exactly. That that's the that's the part that has the psychosis label attached, not being castrated. And so there's this internet survey that I think kind of really um explodes the idea that you have to be crazy to be castrated, or want to be castrated. Yeah. A hundred and twelve people responded UM. Of those reported a desire to be free from sexual urges, and another thirty percent said they either wanted to be castrated for the cosmetics, uh, the appearance. I guess you reference kindall appropriately or as a way to act out of sexual fetish, which later is a thing it is a North Carolina there was. Yeah. So as bizarre as it sounds and is is um I guess across the board and universal. It might seem that that, you know, thinking that you'd have to be crazy to be castrated, or you you would never want to be castrated. There are some people out there who do, I think, and I don't think it makes sense for me. But that makes more sense to me than the people who say, like, I just feel like my left arm shouldn't be on my body. Yeah, because at least castration is tied to lust and these other things that people think might ruin their lives, these sexual urges or in the case of like pedophilia, you know that that comes up later too, So that makes more sense to me than cutting off my left arm because it feels weird. Yeah, you know, like with your left arm every due Yeah, well you know my left arm. Have you ever seen my left foot? I knew you were going to say that I have, of course I have not. Oh, it's good. That was That was the beginnings of Daniel day Lewis is like mastery of acting. He was amazing and that was the first time I've heard of him. I remember, Yeah, I think I don't think that was his first movie. I think My Beautiful Laundrette was before that. No, there was another one that I saw that was before that was the merchant Ivory film. Yeah. Yeah, he was in it and it was man, it was a merchant Ivory. I think he made his name though, and one the Academy Award for that. Yeah. Sure, alright, let's talk about the history. Yeah, Um, I saw a thing that was disturbing that in Korea, Um, they would cast rate boys. You might want to not listen to this. Fair warning me here it comes. I have to you know the other people. Um, that they would allegedly dip the genitals in feces and have a dog eat the genitals off. Well that's a really awful way to do it. I can't imagine anything worse weird. Yeah, that's it's it's pretty awful. Um. So let's get into why someone do this. If you're a eunuch, you were a trusted um friend of the court, perhaps, yeah, well, especially in Korea, the reasoning went and again, like for millennia, eunuchs ran Korea at the behest of the royal families that had the dynasty's in power. Well, you're not gonna start your own dynasty, so there's one reason to trust you. That's the point. Uh. Unuchs were allowed to have families, but they had to adopt kids obviously, and any males that they adopted had to be unix themselves to prevent them founding. Since they were very powerful people. They had to kind of die out. Can you that's so awful? These kids are like, yeah, I'm adopted finally and then then oh, yeah, oh you're unich. Can I go back to the orphanage? Right? Um. The other thing that eunuchs, The other reason unuchs were trusted obviously because they weren't gonna be making any moves on the queen. Well in in the Middle East especially, harms were very popular, and if you have a harem of wives, uh, they need protecting, and you want the guy who's going to protect them to be physically incapable of doing anything with them. Yeah, so hence eunuchs. But these are the point is with the removal of these men's genitalia, they were automatically imbued with a trust because they simply were incapable of of circumventing that trust. So that's that's like one of these weird things about unichs is like, what goes hand in hand with being a eunuch at least as far as government or powers concerned. Sure, trust goes hand in hand with it. Isn't the history of this world crazy when you really kind of get down to the nitty gritty. That's how we're trying to show a little by little just how insane humanity is. Uh So, let's move on to the eighteenth century century in Italy. Um, where saw a movie called Farinellie. Did you ever see that? No? Again? It was it was a movie about a castrato singer. Um, that's I'm glad you said that. Castrato, the pluralist castrati. Same with gelato. Little little do you know? So if your family goes out, you get Gelatti. So his name was Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi, and his stage name was Faranelli. And it's a good movie. You should get it. It was a biopic. It's a biopic about a famous castrado. And in Italy at the time there were women weren't allowed to sing in church. So if you wanted that mezzo soprano, you just got a grown man. With no genitalia. Well he said, sing your heart out. The thing is it was illegal to castrate somebody in Italy at the time. Well in in eighteen seventy it became illegal, So before that I think they were just sort of well so from my understanding, at the very least, it was frowned upon. Because in the eighteenth century, the seventeen hundreds, UM, there were there was basically an underground network of castration surgeons, and there was an anonymous book that came out that was published on it that basically explained how it was one and apparently they would, um, they would basically take a boy. Here's the thing. You wanted your kid to possibly be a castrado because it could mean wealth for you and your family. So a kid's parents, a boy's parents would take him to this castration surgeon. The castration surgeon would pinch the boy's karated artery until he passed out and then cut his testis off the death grip pretty much, then cut his tests off. And this is the way they did it, according to this book from seventeen eighteen UM. Because they tried opium before, but too many of the boys like died from from Yeah, they odeed and died, so they would just pinch their karate and then remove their tests. Uh. And a lot of people think that you could do this at any stage and produce a high pitched voice. Yeah, that's like the whole thing. Like even when you get kicked in the groin and guy, you can thank Martin Short for perpetuating that joke. Uh, that's not true. It has to be done before puberty, before your vocal cords have lengthened, and those of the male sex hormones are produced in the testy. So if you get rid of those, what you've got is a man that continues to grow. And interestingly, castrato castrati, their limbs grow really long, and their ribs, the rib cage gets bigger because there without testosterone, their bone joints don't harden like they should. So that produces an effect of better able to breathe and so like it makes you a better singer. But you're singing through the vocal cords of a child, right because during puberty one of the things your voice change. You remember that Brady bunch where Peter Brady's voice changes. Can forget what was going on? Was the testosterone in his body was lengthening his vocal cords by anywhere between thirty five and ninety two millimeters. So your vocal cords increased by length during puberty. Within a castrado, the vocal chords don't link and nearly as much because they've only got about five percent of the testosterone compared to an uncastrated person. But their pharynx grows, their oral cavity grows, their lungs grow, and then, like you said, their ribcage grows to allow their lungs to grow even more. Take a deeper breath. So you have somebody who has, like this, the ability to hold a note like a male, a male adult, but a high pitched, resonant voice. Yes, it's a weird combination of like a super powerful, like an extra powerful singing voice through the vocal chords of a kid. But the upshot is if you remove the testings of an adult male, his voice isn't going to change a bit. He's just going to be really mad. His demeanor might right. Um, so I guess what'd you say? Eighteen? What when they outlawedit is when it became officially illegal. The thing is is it was definitely frowned upon because I found criticism of the church that the acchoir at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which is where the Pope says masks um, had tons of castrati even though you weren't really supposed to, and the opera houses would have castrati. The thing is it was very, very very competitive. So there are a lot of boys who were castrated and never went anywhere with their singing career, and then over time they outlawed it. In Italy was kind of like, we should probably stop doing this, Yeah, and maybe we should just let girls sing in church. Yeah, you know, I'm sure that had a pretty big impact. Um. You should see Fairnelly. Check it out. It's good. Um. So you might think that this is the kind of thing that went away and like, let's say the eight hundreds, But no, it happened up until in England, at least chemically the nineteen fifties. Because we've talked about this before. The great father of computing an adventure of the Turing test. Alan Turing was homosexual, which is illegal. It was was at the time, and he was given a choice and go to prison or you can take this These injections of still but straw it's a female sex hormone, and it gave him boobs and made him impotent, and he he laced an apple with cyanide and died by his own hand by eating the apple a couple of years later. Yeah, And I don't think they called it chemical castration at the time. They just were like, this is will limit your libido, right, So I think that came up in the mid nineteen sixties in the United States. So basically we went from people's parents having them castrated as boys to the state taking over. So that's that's how castration is typically carried out at the hands of the state these days as punishment um for crime. And in six um, a guy named John Money uh, an American physician uh he um, he came up with this procedure, which is just a simple round of injections of something called medoxy progesterone acetate, which is a birth control used by women. And basically you just take the same round of birth control that you would give a woman and give it to a guy who was having sexual urges that he was scared of or um sexual feelings for children or whatever, and it would reduce his libido and he would be cured. The thing is this, this first chemical castration in America was voluntary. It was a treatment basically for a pedophile who hadn't committed a crime yet. And the state said, hey, that's a pretty good idea. We're gonna start making that compulsory. In California was the first. I think that is a good time to break for a message that will learn about modern castration after that. Okay, so you said California, which is kind of surprising, as liberal as it is, to get on board first and allowing chemical castrat shan as uh Well was it was? It still like an option or no. Before that, it was like if you were a caught if you were a pedophile who was caught doing something, or a rapist or something it's sex criminal. Um, you could say, hey, I heard about this this chemicals castration thing. How about instead of going to prison, you just give that to me. It was a bargaining chip. So if you if you use your penis to commit a crime, they would give you this option, or you your lawyer could bring it up. They may not give you the option, but it was something that was out there that you could use to bargain your way out of prison with potentially In the mid nineties, California said, it's not a bargaining chip anymore, Like you're this is gonna happen to you, Like this is something that can happen to you. This is a sentence we can we can exact on you. Well, the Czech Republic surgically castrated sex offenders until so did Germany. Germany did. I don't think nearly as long, but for a long time, like in your up. That's how um pedophilia was was cured, was through castration or sex offenses. Yeah, and since there's a surgical they had success rate of uh no recid recidivism. So the word reciitativism, recidativism, it's a bone head word. It's uh but that ain't me no more. Um So, Yeah, the chemical one, uh, the chemical variety can be reversed if you stop taking the drugs. It's generally thought that you you can go back to achieving erections and doing things with your penis. Well, there's a study right of um of German sex offenders. Well, let me tell you about Joseph Frank Smith first. So when you are chemically castrated, the recidativism rate drops from eight percent for non treated like just basically, you send the person to prison, there's an eighty percent chance they're going to commit another sex crime later to just five percent among chemically castrated people. Yeah, takes the window of their sales, it does. And one of the reasons why America got really behind the idea of chemical castration was because of a guy named Joseph Frank Smith. So back in three he was convicted of raping a woman for the second time, the same woman. Yeah, and they were like, you're you're losing your junk. We're going to chemically castrate you. And he basically became this poster boy for chemical castration. He would give interviews about it. He would talk publicly about how it freed him and how it changed his life, and like how this is such a great humane treatment for the for people with you know, sex offense problems, um, and all the while he was out there raping and committing other sex crimes while he was giving these interviews. And finally he got caught and he was he was convicted of a few sex offenses, but he's suspected of seventy five more over the years. And the whole reason was he stopped taking his injections. Yeah, I see. That's the thing that I didn't get, is that not they just said, here, just take these. I guess over time enough trust See that's the thing that you That trust in unis was still reflected all these years later on this guy, because people thought he was castrated, and because he was really working people with his public image as well. Yeah, I think the state would carry out that punishment for you know life, right, you would think so. But I guess, hey, Joe Frank, you've really you've really knocked us off our feet. You just handle this. We'll give you some needles. You do it at home. Or maybe he suggested, maybe he's like, Doc, I've seen yeah, right, I can do this. Yeah. But however it happened, whoever was in charge of him getting that that chemical castration injections really dropped the ball in Possibly as many as eighty people were victimized as a result. So you did mention earlier that something we should clear up. You said that even if the testes are removed, there's still that five percent chance. Um, that's because some of your testosterone is made in the pituitary gland. About five percent. Yeah, not all of it comes from the old testicles, which is why your vocal cords grows some when you're castrado. So that explains that. Right. The thing is, now we've come to the German sex offenders study called study right. Yeah, so back in nineteen s somebody carried out a study of German sex offenders who had had um are ectomys. Yeah, that's the testicle removal. Right. So even these guys orchaeect to me, sorry, um, even among these guys, we're still able to have sex twenty years after the procedures. Germans are, they have a stick to it. They're they're very efficient. But they that's because their pituitary gland it's still generating enough testosterone that they could get interaction. Well, you know what Germans say, my pituitary gland produces more testosterone by ten am than years does all day the field saying right, um, if they got a penick to me, which is cutting off your testicles and your penis complete removal of all of your junk, followed by drug therapy to reduce the hormones, then you're basically that's only the only way to get a chance of like no following no crimes. That's the only way to reduce libia. Well, that was my two cents, based on my research. It would take the removal of the penis, the removal of the testing, and drug therapy to to drop the libido down enough. But yeah, that was just my research. Uh So you go on to point out I think that's very fair to call out some of the positives that people feel um for sex offenders. A lot of them say that, you know what this is. I feel freed, I feel serenity. I don't have these urges anymore. I did not feel normal and well before, and now I do, and I can go out and live my life as a normal person because no one else knows about what's going on downstairs. But there is criticism of the use of castration in any form by the state as punishment for um for a sex crime, though mainly if it is in the United States at least, if it is punishment for a crime, then groups like you know, Amnesty International and a c L you say, well, then that's a cruel and unusual punishment. Sure. Uh. Secondly, if you're using it to prevent future crimes, I can't think of anything more unconstitutional than that. Unless it's voluntary. But if it's the state saying we're gonna give you this to keep you from possibly committing a crime that you may or may not commit in the future, you're not supposed to be able to do that. But society kind of looks the other way on that one. And then thirdly, it doesn't always work. It is the case of Joe Frank Smith shows us. But you're right, there are some people who who have had umbrating experience exactly, but they're not necessarily criminals. We should probably divide that right about here. Anyone who's been castrated doesn't mean they're a criminal. Um. There's a lot of there's a lot of parallels between people who voluntarily seek castration and um A sexuals, the third sexual orientation who We've did a podcast on BEA that was a good one too. Yeah. Uh, And I guess that brings us to the final piece of the pie, is uh, castration seeking sexual gratification. Right, it's a very small niche group of people. I would hope these are like the people who are the opposite of the people who want to be castrated, to be free from sexual urges and desires so they can just live their lives in a freer way. These people want to be castrated for sexual gratification. Yeah, like masochists get into this. You know, not all of them, but there you know, you know they'ld saying whatever floats your boat. For some people, this floats their boat. And it may seem really weird to us. But in um, North Carolina and Waynesville, which is right outside of Asheville, in two thousand six, these uh, well actually three men, um many, Yeah you did. You could have just seen them without the story men like I know what those guys are into. Yeah. Um they had a quote unquote dungeon fashion from an enclosed car poard and they carried out uh, surgical castration for people voluntarily. At least six dudes voluntarily did this for sexual gratification in their little dungeon. They were like underground, unlicensed surgeons who did it in their own home. And um, the reason that people went to this guy, these guys was because there are supposedly surgeons around the world who will, for enough money carry out surgical castration. But if you're into like S and M and that's why you're being castrated, they don't allow that you're going to, Well, they're not gonna like torture you sexually before, after, or during the operation, which is what you're after. And with the castration for um massochistic purposes for sexual gratification. Uh, the you're never going to have a pen ectomy because you still want to be able to have sex afterwards. But you may have you may have your scrotum removed, you may have one testicle removed, you may have both removed, and you will probably do this under more than one operation over time. But you're being sexually tortured while you're Wow, you're being operated on. That's like you said, another piece of the pie. That's right. And uh, Richard Master Rick Ciarra, he was the lead um physician. I guess you could say he actually worked for twenty three years as a physician's assistant, so he had a little background. Yeah, from what I understand that none of the surgeries were like, nobody died or got an infection or anything like that. They seemed to know what they were doing. So it was him, it was his partner of twenty years, Michael Mendez, and then a man they called their slave, Danny Carroll Reeves, who all pleaded. Originally, they were charging them with um operating medical establishment and practice practicing medicine without a license. Right, And we should also point out like every single one of their patients was there voluntarily. One guy flew from South America for his surgery. Yeah, Like where do you go, Waynesville, North Carolina. Yeah, right, it's the it's the home of S and M operations. In the end, they did not get convicted of those crimes. There were misdemeanors. They ended up leading guilty to felony castration and maiming and uh Master Rick served a year in prison. Um Michael Mendez for four months and the slave man served eight months and at the time of his life may have So I think it's neat that those guys found each other, like three people who are in another thing about this small town. Yeah, I mean, I can understand the guy from South America finding these guys from the internet. But if like these guys were partners for twenty years, and this is in two thousand and six, that definitely predates the internet. So like, these guys who were into some very unique stuff found one another. Yeah, and it may have been thanks to uh An S and M website because I looked. I was like, I gotta see what this Master Rick looks like. And there was pictures of him from his uh profile at kolar me dot com and I was like, collar me dot com what's that? And I was like, oh, well, what do you think it is? Put it coller on like a dog collar. Yeah right, yeah, I'm hip, Yeah you're you're in the now. But yeah, there was a picture of the dude with his uh buttless chaps on and Mr Rick served a year. Yeah. I feel like if there's anything about castration, it's that it has it encompasses a lot of different people with a lot of for a lot of different reasons, over a lot of period of time. Yeah, that's just another one of those weird human things that we have to let you know about. Yeah, now we never have to talk about it again. You got anything else, I got nothing else. I've got something else. We'd probably be remiss to not mention the Heaven's Gate cult. Remember them, Yeah, they were castrated and weird.
