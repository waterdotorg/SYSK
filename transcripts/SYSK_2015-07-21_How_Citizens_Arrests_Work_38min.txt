Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. You're under arrest. I didn't do anything. Yeah, I saw it with my own two eyes. You're coming with me. You didn't see jack ant scene? Is that anthene or anthyne? How many times you get to say that? Yeah? So that was my rendition of how the citizens arrests could go. We've been asked to do this for a while. Yeah, we finally did. Yeah, we're doing it now. Did you know that on June nine a man in Australia died while being citizens arrested? Uh? No, he was being detained by like five or six guys and held down for eight minutes and zip tied and he died. You know, I feel like we talked about once when um, some people said don a guy to detain him, that we did in London or something and he died. It happens, it does have. I totally remember that. Yeah. It was guy's busted in on a diamond shop. One got away, one got sat on until he died. Yes, that was scary, even though people were going to get off of me. He's dying so um that that reveals one of the many, many, many things that can go wrong during a citizen's arrest, which is why we wanted to say at the top of this and probably well many times, you should not perform citizens arrest, even though it is conceivably your right if you're here in America to do so, um and all over the world you not necessarily mean almost every single country has a citizen's arrest law, even ones that are not touched by the long arm of the British Empire, all over the place. I got the impression that was basically an English common law concept. Maybe it's been co opted then because I saw like Turkey, Hong Kong, all over the world. Okay, wherever you are, you probably should not try to performance since the arrest. There's all sorts of other stuff you can do, especially in the day of like a smartphone call the cops, take video, take video, take pictures. Um. The one the one time when a lot of citizens arrest laws do say you probably should do something is when you see somebody being hurt, injured, or their their life is in danger. For the most part, though, especially if no one is being hurt. You should not perform as citizens arrest. That's your advice to the general public. Yes, do you not agree? I don't know. It depends. I think it's situational, Okay, depends on who they are, who you are, and what's going down. Well, the problem is a lot of people say citizens arrest, you do that for like if somebody if it won't turn down their their stereo at night, stuff like that easily turns into like a fight. Yeah, that's not his address. That you should just have a little dummy, fine book and if it makes you feel better to write somebody a citation, do it. And as a result, a lot of states, I think recognize the fact that if you just say yeah, you can do citizens the rest for anything, it will start out as somebody was trying to arrestue for playing your stereo too loud, too late, and then turn into a fight and then somebody dies that kind of thing. So a lot of case, a lot of states say you it has to be a felony. And there's all sorts of other stipulations in details, But the whole thing, like I said, Chuck, is rooted at least in the United States and English common law, specifically the posse komitatas. Yeah, dating back to medieval England. That was a time when, uh, they needed that and the sheriff of the land counted on citizens because they didn't have a police force of hundreds of dudes, uh, and they needed citizens to help them out. Basically, yeah, and possecomitatis is Latin for force of the county or force of the community. And it basically in English common law was the ability of the sheriff to say, you, fifteen year old boy, and up, you're able bodied. I need help arresting this guy. You were obligated to help me to sit on him, to sit on him, but get off and when I tell you to. Yeah. And in the United States it was I think, in which is not that long ago. I mean just the turn of the nineteen hundreds, Philadelphia, big city, only had fifteen detectives, so they counted on people to help out. Um In the infamous mass murderer H. H. Holmes was tracked and caught by a private citizen. Oh was that right? Yeah, he was a private detective. But it's not a cop, okay, because I was trying to find like famous, have there ever been any like noteworthy citizens arrest. That's pretty noteworthy. That was the only one I could find, h Holmes. But it's because first serial killer was brought down by citizens arrest. It was tough to Uh, it's it's tough to get good information on this though, because, as you'll see, the every state has their own law, and within states, each municipality has different versions of the law, right, so it's all over the place. The rule of film that I ran across in researching this is if the site or the text from a site seemed huffy and indignant and just fed up, then you should really take that stuff with a grain AsSalt. Yeah. And I also found a lot of cases to these days where it's become kind of a tool for activism, where somebody like an environmentalist will try to arrest the mayor in front of everyone at a town meeting. There's a site called arrest Blair dot org, I believe, and the it's a site dedicated to placing Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, under arrest for war crimes, and like five or six people have done it so far, and it's all just totally symbolic. Yeah, exactly. But and there's a lot of like steps that they suggest you follow and like, don't make it seem like you're trying to carry out any violent act or anything like that. It's all symbolic. Yeah, but if you could get Tony Blair to come with you to to I don't know, um jail. Sure, they're like, go for it, but he's not going to know. I've also seen people try to arrest like oil company executives and stuff like that. Again just a statement. Uh, so let's talk about let's break it down into a federal law and state law. Um, federal law and you this is a blog post of yours, right, and this where this came from. How about that? How about it? It's our first one based on a blog post which is sort of just a version of an article no we did. Um oh yeah, that's right. Good point. So if you're talking federal law, um, it has to be interpreted as such. It's not. It doesn't clearly say in federal law like you can do this. No, there's some real fancy footwork in interpreting this. And there's a group called um oh what are they called time fighters? Yeah? I looked when I wrote this blog post originally, Um, there's no website for crime fighters. They have a newsletter should say a lot, but there's this long document and you can find it on the post for this episode on our website that has like I mean, just every detail you could possibly think of. Some of it good advice, some of it contradictory advice, some advice not good, like for example, um, there's uh sentences like when in doubt, check first, Like if if you're not sure if a crime that you're arresting somebody for is a misdemeanor or felony, check first. So apparently when in doubt you should have already checked beforehand is their guy or zip ties make handy handcuffs. You should not be using handcuffs. Cops even use zip ties cops do. Here's a there's a this is a theme we're gonna keep running into chuck cops who are sworn law enforcement officers. That's their career. And there's plenty of cops that are like bad apples that I'm not talking about that at this point. What I'm saying is is if you're a citizens arrest person and you're carrying around zip ties to use his handcuffs, you are going to get in trouble because the same the same protections that are afforded to cops who use zip ties are not afforded to you necessarily. No, it's a different deal. So if you look at a Title eight teen, Section two two three six UM, when talking federal law, we should probably just read this because the wording is important. Whoever, being an officer, agent, or employee of the the United States or any department of agency thereof, engaged in the enforcement of any law of the United States, searches any private dwelling used and occupied as such dwelling without a warrant directing such search, or maliciously and without reasonable cause searches any other building or property without a search warrant. Shall be fined under this Title for a first offense, and for a subsequent offense, shall be fined under this title, and in prison not more than one year or both. Right. So, basically, what's that that's saying is the the federal government is aware that there's bad apples who are sworn officers of the law UM, and they anybody who conducts a search without a warrant or without probable cause is in trouble. Yes, here's the thing. They're like there's a couple of exceptions, and we want to make plain right. And they say that this section shall not apply to any person, which as huge as we'll see in a second, A serving a warrant of arrest be arresting or attempting to arrest a person committing or attempting to commit an offense in his presence, or who is committed or is suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed a felony, or making a search at the request or invitation or with the consent of the occupant of the premises. So they're saying, if you're a law enforcement officer, you don't have to have a warrant if one of those three A, B or C is fulfilled. But the thing that crime stoppers UM, crime fighters, The thing that crime fighters UH says is well, wait, they switch language. The first part has to do with the law enforcement officer. In the second part they use the word person. Yeah, any person and any person as a citizen. Right, that's right. So technically, UM, under federal law, if you interpret it this way, you have the right to UM take to commit I guess, commit to carry out a citizens or ask if you if there is a felony, right, so yeah, or if you could get your hand on a warrant, which you can't unless you're like a bounty hunter or a private detective, which, by the way, bounty hunters, UM February Okay, if you want to go listen to that one. Yep, it's a good one. Yeah, we did that one in bail. Right, Bail and bounty hunters is like a duel, that's right. Uh. And then since most people, most citizens can't get their hands on a warrant, that part b kicks in where if you see somebody committing a felony, um, you're you can arrest them, that's right. So that's what crime fighters and a lot of other people say. This is federal justification for citizens arrest. That's right. But the states, the states love citizens arrest, yes, and we'll talk about those states laws right after this. So, Josh, you mentioned that states love citizens arrest, love them. Not exactly the case, but they definitely opened ings up quite a bit. Uh. Depending on what state and what municipality you live in. UM, you may be able to perform citizens arrests on misdemeanors that you actually witness, felonies you don't even witness, um, anything that could cause a breach of peace, whether you witness it or not. And this all depends on the state and or in the case of Kentucky, you are called upon to do so. So there's they say you must do so. Right, there's a case in the thirties that has been interpreted in Kentucky to mean that you if you see a crime in action, like you have to do something. Yeah, the quote is you must take affirmative steps, is what it says in the law. I don't think you know, obviously they're not going to charge someone with not doing something, although you never know, but they do charge you in Kentucky with like, hey, this is your obligation and going to do something. I mean, you've seen the last episode of Seinfeld. It's basically the same thing. They saw a man being harassed on the street and laughed instead of helping him, and so they were prosecuted under the Good Samaritan law. That's right. So instead of see something, say something, it's see something, sit on them. It's exactly right, that's the law. So, um, that's Kentucky. There are other states that say you have to see a felony in progress to make a citizen's arrest, right, um. And then other states are saying you better know what you're talking about. A few arrest isism because if a conviction doesn't happen, that guy can turn around and sue you. You can be charged with all sorts of things. Um, so you better you better get that conviction, Like, you better know what you're talking about. It better be a cut and dried case if you're gonna make a citizen's arrest. Yeah. And then there are all manner of um rules and regulations depending on your state, like um. For instance, in Utah, they will let you arrest somebody for a misdemeanor or felony, but you're not allowed to use deadly force. Other states say you can use what they call reasonable force, but they you know, that's highly subjective and I guess would be determined in a court. Uh. Some states say you should not are not allowed to question or search your The only thing you can do is detain them. And this is in different countries too. They have similar laws I looked at, like Canada and England and Finland and Norway. I mean, it's all over the place and they're all kind of similar. Um. Although in some states they will let you see as a weapon or evidence if it is in plain view, or if you're under an immediate threat, like you can take a gun from a guy um or sees if you know the key low cocaine spills out onto the street, you can like brush that aside and say, dear, would you put that in the car until the cops get here. That'd be funny if you don't realize that you're in a state where you're not allowed to take a gun. So you take a guy's gun and he's like, he's citizens arrest you back for taking his gun, and he just keeps going back and forth like that exactly. Uh. And then there's something also called some states allow merchant searchers searches, Oh, like a security guard at a department store or something. Yeah, or even just a shop owner, like I saw you put that thing in your pocket, Um, then go digging through the pockets. Um. So yeah, if you're a shopkeeper, you have certain rights as well. So if you are um one of those people who likes to do citizens arrestaurants interested by that kind of thing, um, which means he couldn't make it as a cop crime crime fighters, um, do you remember that one King of the Hill where uh, the security guard like I think he drops Bobby off or something like that, and um, the security guard tells Hanky issues of them a warning that he's parked more than three feet away from the curb, and Hank goes, you're not a cop, and the guy goes, that's why it's only a warning. Pretty great stuff. I heard a interview a great interview with Mike Judge recently. Um, he's awesome, he is and super super smart Idiocracy like he was a physicist and engineer before before he got into the animation game before he did be this and butt head wow, which is really kind of funny. Nice. Yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah, he's not a big fan of Idiocracy himself. Actually, man, what is wrong with him? He basically was like, you know, he's his I think general take was it was okay, but it was sort of a which was kind of my problem with like a one joke thing that ultimately didn't play out over and over again. I loved it all right, Um, he'll appreciate here in that I think loved it. Mike Judge, So, uh, if you are going to do this kind of stuff, you better know your state laws in and out. Yeah. First of all, you better know whether it has to be a felony for you to to carry out a citizen's arrest, in which case you better know the different between a misdemeter and a felony, and different classes of felonies, so you know when to intervene and when not to. You also need to know whether you can use handcuffs or try to restrain somebody right, what force you can use right at? What escalation of force means, which typically um is, if the guy is coming at you with a baseball bat, you could conceivably come at him back with your own blunt object. But if the guy's got a he brought a baseball bat to a make fight, right yeah, which I mean, that's they're both blunt objects, right. I would take a spiked ball over a baseball bat. But if that guy comes at you with like just as fists and you knife them a bunch of times, you've escalated the violence and you're probably going to be in trouble across the board though, no matter what state you're in, if it allows for citizens arrest, which I didn't see a state that didn't have some sort of provision are there. Did you run across any I think pretty much everywhere you can eat. I mean, if you can arrest someone in Massachusetts, right, then you can arrest someone anywhere. Um, you do not have to read a suspect his or her rights. Yeah, that makes sense though that I think about it, because you're not an officer of the law, right, and the Miranda Rights specifically give the right to remain silent around officers of the law. Yeah, but if that person sings like a canary, I think you can go and testify later if you if you want. You are a witness. You're not an officer of the law, and therefore that person has no right to remain silent. I mean, they cannot talk to you. But the stuff that they that right against self incrimination, that that the Miranda Rights give them does not apply to somebody telling a citizen that kind of thing if the citizen wants to be a state witness, which you probably do if you're you know, you're probably like double waghmy citizens arrest and state witness and now I have to go into witness identity protection for the rest of my life. We we did an episode on that too. Yeah, this is all part of our crime and Punishment series, I guess. Um. The other thing that I saw almost across the board, I think is that if you commit, or if you keep saying commit, it sounds like a crime. If you take part in the citizen's arrest, you have to make your intention known and tell them what you're doing, all right. You can't just jump on someone and smash their face in the ground. You have to like advertise I am making a citizen's arrest. Now, according to crime fighters, there are some exceptions to that rule. If the person if this is the commission of the crime, like if that guy is like sitting there and has the shop owner and it's like robbing somebody, you can jump on them then without saying that. If they're fleeing the commission of the crime, supposedly you can jump on them without saying you're under arrest. And then apparently before um arrest was considered part and parcel to detainment. So again according to crime fighters, which again I suspect is dubious in a lot of cases, Um that before you had to at least lightly touched the person while telling them that they you were performing a citizen's arrest and then apparently it was later uninterpreted to not be the case. You could just inform somebody, so Josh, we mentioned, um, the one thing you have to do in almost all cases, unless it's unless you're literally breaking up, you know, a crime, that you have to tell them what you're doing. The other thing across the board is as quickly as possible you have to try and get the real police there. Very important, Chuck. You know, you can't just uh go like your eyes examined, or hold someone for questioning, Like, don't start playing cop because you're not one. You you need to immediately get a cop on the scene as fast as possible and they wreck come in Like, don't do that by putting them in your car and driving them down to the station. No, there's a couple of reasons for that. One is that your car is your own property, and you could conceivably be considered um to be imprisoning those people in your car, like you're kidnapping, whereas with like a taxi, that's a public vehicle and that kind of I would guess you could argue that that was a public vehicle that these people got into you with. And then secondly, the other reason why you want to use the taxis because if you're driving your own car, it's just the two of you and you're driving, whereas with the taxi you're being given around by somebody. But I wouldn't recommend a taxi either in today's cell phone land, just get a cop there or just call uber which is funny. There's a guy who uh in Sydney, Australia, I think where we're huge um. He has been calling uber cars, hiring uber cars and then citizens arresting the drivers because they're breaking the law by not being licensed taxi drivers. When you don like he's a lot of fun at heart. When you google citizens arrest and click on news, that was the first thing that comes up, it's like some Australian uber vigilanti. Wow. Alright, so your contention bad idea always here and there's just because there's too many X factors. I mean, when when pro cops are on the scene bystanders get shot. You know we're talking about people who are, for all intents and purposes, active vigilantes. I would guess that that would tace the not necessarily. I mean an active vigilanti as someone who prowlsed the streets praying, playing crime fighter. I would guess that most of the citizens arrests carried out in this country are by people like that. You think people who are the head of neighborhood patrols, people who are um, yes, prowling the streets. Well, there are a lot of George Zimmerman's out there for exactly. But I would be curious about statistics on people who are witnessing a crime and jump in and help. Okay, So um to me, it's it's just is uh, it's there's just too many X factors, um, And there's a lot of things that can go wrong. Right. So for example, UM, when you walk up to somebody and say I am performing as citzens of arrest, touch them lightly, right, or you don't have to do that anymore, um, because you I am charging you with snatching that purse. I just saw you do it. That person is probably going to be like, you're not a cop. Yeah, I doubt if they would say, well you got me, you got me. Here's where you got zip ties on you, because I've got some. If you don't write exactly, go ahead, Um, that is probably not gonna happen right now. If that doesn't happen, and you say, I want to warn you, you're not coming with me can lead to charges of resisting arrest, even though it's citizens arrested, which is true in a lot of cases. Um, that person say well, why don't you grab me and see what happens? And when you do that, because you're a literalist, you grab them to see what happens, and they stab you, which happens. It actually happened to four Guardian Angels. You know those guys, right, they're the professional citizens arrestors exactly. They really are. For as as close as you can come to being a pro that is the Guardian Angels. Yea. And if it can go south on them, it can go south on you. Yeah. I read this really interesting article about them. They were formed in nineteen seventy nine in New York. Right, Yeah, we should do with a show on them. That'd be great, Okay, But in the meantime everybody should go read the Twilight of the Guardian Angels and I think narratively on that site, but it was really interesting. Started out as a McDonald's manager who was sick of crime and his neighborhood and recruited some of his other employees, and remember that guy, Like I can still picture the main dude in my head. He's still around. Yeah, because it was when we were kids. It was a big deal, Guardian Angels. You heard about it a lot there on talk show circuits. Uh, it was a necessary thing in New York City. Yeah, they were on Sally, they were on Donahue. Yea, yeah, they're on all of them. Um, but as recently as two thousand twelve in Chicago, four of them got stabbed when they were trying to arrest a Personnatcher. Another guy came up and just started stabbing him. One of the Guardian Angels got stabbed in the head, another one in the ribs, and both suspects got away. So if the Guardian Angels as a group are getting stabbed, what do you think is gonna happen to you? Yeah, when you walk up and say I'm placing you under arrest, come with me. Yeah, that's a good point. Okay, So there's point one is a bad idea. Uh well point two was kind of included in there. This person you have no idea what kind of weapon they might have. You know, you might see the weapon and if it's like someone holding up a store or something like fast Times at Ridgemont High, which case you uh, distract them, throw coffee on them. Oh gnarly yeah, and then you get away, you know, scott free. I think you hire Van Halen to play your birthday party? Was it? Van um? But all getting aside very dangerous. Even if you don't see a weapon doesn't mean that you're scott free. And if you're one of those people who's like, I'm Dabney Coleman, I have like twenty four hours to live, so I don't care if I die, Well, what about bystanders, innocent bystanders on you? What if it's not a knight, But if it's a gun, sure, um. So there's a lot of a lot of moving parts that you have to take into account. And even crime fighter says, if if you are thinking of performing a citizen's arrest and there's a lot of people around, don't because you have no idea how south it can go. You don't know if the person has a gun, and if so, if they're willing to shoot at you or anybody else who gets in their way, it's yeah, I mean, and again, unless you're seeing somebody in trouble, like in real physical danger. Even crime fighters is like, you know, maybe drop back and write their license plate number down or just call the cops. This is even crime fighters saying this, I know. And they're like those real life superheroes that the streets at night with capes and masks. They're coming up in a minute. So um. Another great reason to not do so is a little something we touched on earlier, which is you open yourself up to all manner of lawsuits if you are mistaken, if things don't go well, if you end up injuring this person and they are innocent, falls, imprisonment charges, kidnapping, like you name it. Man, you can be in big, big trouble, pat down somebody the wrong way, sexual assault, um, even salt and battery. Um yeah, if you like, even verbal threats can lead to charges of assault and battery. That's right, civil suits. You could be not only arrested, but you could have the pants suit off of you exactly so that that would be reason enough for me, aside from the fact that I'm a pennywise pacifist. And then lastly, Chuck, yes, the the the whole thing opens you up to a possibility that is way more possible than the average time when you're just walking around the street mining your own business, of actually killing somebody. Yeah, George Zimmerman. Yes, and it's not just George Zimmerman. It happens like it happens with with citizens arrests. Where um, there's a guy in San Jose and two thirteen, Ricardo Hernandez. He was um trying to citizens arrest a burglar named or suspected burglar named Christopher Soriano. They got into a fight over a gun um that Hernandez had on him, and Soriano died. So now Hernandez is going to prison for four years and has a head on him, has a one on him. Ahead, he killed somebody. Oh, I've never heard that term. So that's a great point. Might end up killing someone. Do you really want to do that right? Exactly? You gotta think these things through. Yeah, there are very few people that I would in trust to perform a citizen's arrest in a in the right way. How about Phoenix Jones and his sidekicking wife Purple Rain Seattle real life superheroes. Oh well, that's always a bad idea. They dress up and patrol the streets. He has his own YouTube channel. Yeah, there's Dark Guardian in New York City who hangs around Washington Square Park at night where we did a live podcast. Yeah, there's a great documentary on the real life superheroes Razor Hawk in Minneapolis. Yeah, they're all over and they um, they can be a problem. Sometimes it's just for fun. But it's not like the movie kick Ass. It doesn't go down that way. Well. Yeah, and even cops are like, do not do this, Like that's not a good idea. Yeah, we don't need your help, that is what they're saying. So crazy. Yeah, I wonder what happens when you try to perform as citizens arrest on a cop um. I imagine that doesn't go well these days. I would guess that doesn't go well either. Yeah. I wouldn't advise that. No. Finally, we come to his type of citizens arrest that you advise not to do. No, no, no, no no, I don't advise anyone to do it. Like I said, they were very like my brother in law. I would entrust him to do a citizen's arrest. Oh yeah, I've met him. Yeah, I can see him doing the citizens arrest following the books, or when it goes south like putting you like twisting your arm behind your back or you're screaming uncle. Uh. Yeah, but even in his case, it can go south, you know. Yeah, I can go south in anybody. So he's got a gun, he didn't see it, and then it's like it's all over for him. That's no good. No one wants that. That's right. See something, say something, not see something. Sit on them. Man. This episode is so fraught it's crazy. I think the message is clear. Okay, if you want to know more about Citizens Arrest, you can go read the blog post on it on Stuff you Should Know dot com. Um. You can also just search citizens Arrest and have hours of entertainment about and learn why you shouldn't do this kind of thing. Uh. And since I said you shouldn't do this, it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this the film Vault. Our buddy Brian Bishop of The Adam Corolla Show, and I emailed him back from this and said, this is just the worst kind of buzz marketing. Well, I'm gonna take him to task on air. Brian is um. He works on The Adam Corolla Show and he also has a podcast, The Zone called The Film Vault, which is great, and uh, we'll get him a little plug too. He also wrote a great book called Shrinkage, Manhood, Marriage, and the Tumor That Tried to Kill Me about his battle with cancer. Great book. So Brian took us to task and he said, hey, guys, I was listening to a recent episode and the subject of Hollywood remakes came up. You guys are correcting this because we bagged on pretty much all remakes or you did. Yes, you guys are correct in the sense that the vast majority are terrible. There are a few good, dare I say great ones. However, we did an entire film Vault episode on top five remakes, and here's my list with some honorable mentions. And I told him we will just take him to task right here. So number one on his list is when I have a problem with Vanilla Sky. Yeah, I didn't think that was a very good movie. What when did they make that? Originally it was a Spanish language movie, just like the year before. Um, I can't remember the name of it, Dreams Open Your Eyes, I think in Spanish whatever that is, so that um Cameron Crow Remakes is Vanilla s guy, And I didn't think it was a good That was his number one. Have you seen his uh, Cameron Crow's latest movie. No, No, I don't. I don't want to either. I used to love that day, like he was my hero, my filmmaking hero. I read this article. Um it was a poll of just like a straw poll of critics movie critics around the um the internet, like what director has let you down the most? Yeah, and he was one of them that was listed because he was so great and it's just gone so downhill, far and away. The guy with the most votes was m Night Sha Milan one good movie, which like they still love him in Philadelphia. We found out that's right alright. Number two, The Departed. I'm gonna say yes for that for sure. That was I think a Japanese movie called Infernal Affairs that Scorcese read a Little Shop of Horrors. I honestly, I've never seen it, so I have no opinion. I didn't know they remade it Casino Royale. That's technically I guess you could call that a remake. Yeah, but not so really, But no, I guess it was. I mean it was the same plot, all right. It was the same plot. Yeah, for the most part. Ocean's Eleven. I'll hand it to him there. I thought Ocean's Eleven was a really good movie and a great remake. Okay, yeah, and then his honorable mention the Italian Job. I never saw it. You never saw the remake? Nope, I didn't either. No, I saw the remake. I never saw the original. It was not great, and he was stretching with that one. The Fly. I didn't know the Fly. I had an original. So I'm gonna go ahead and say great then, because cronenbergs the Fly, it's awesome. Yeah, man, the the original fly. It has Vincent Price in it and it ends with um they like they switch. That's the thing, right, So like there's a there's a human with a fly head freaky, and then there's a fly with the human head and that fly gets trapped in the spider's web at the end, get the most unsettling sound where it's like, wow, it's really disconcerted. I just got like chill bumps. Very well done. I feel like we done that before. And people wrote in We're like, don't do the fly impression. It's really unsettling. The brindle fly. No, the original, the original fly. Uh. He has the Ring, of course, the original Japanese version Ringo. I believe I wasn't a big fan of the Ring. It was fine. Three ten to Yuma, pretty good Western, pretty good remake. I'll give him that. Did you ever see the original for the Grudge? I think it's called like You You ju On Dude good. Probably the best Japanese horror film of all time, which is saying something it was so good, prove me wrong, people. I'm always looking for a good horror movie, and if you have one that really top you on, not a different one, but one that is actually better than you want, I want to know about it, all right. And then he finishes up the honorable mention list with Scarface, which just put that instead of Vanilla Sky, and you've got a pretty decent top five. His Scarface is great, Brian to palms re of I think that had been done a couple of times, if I'm not mistaken. What was it? Jimmy Cagney was the first one, right, I think, so, uh, Jimmy Cagney, and then Jimmy Stewart. Oh yeah, Fred McMurray. So so, Brian goes to say this was back in two thousand tens, so it may have been some good ones since then, actually, but just so you don't lose all hope that a remake can't be anything but awful. That from our buddy Thanks, who just recently throughout the first pitch a professional baseball and so did our friend Nick Thune, And I'm like, what do you gotta do? I want to throw out our first pitch? What what team? The Giants? It wasn't the Giants did it in Seattle where he's from. So he got to the field and he like wore a full uniform and did the full wind up and like, look good. Brian did it at a Padres game even though he's a Giants fan, and um, I think he said it went pretty well as as well. He tells a story on the Adam Coral Show that is awesome. Man, I want to do that. Yes, I wonder if they'd let us do it together. Just yeah, like the thing with two heads. Now they do that. They ended up like the Stanley Cup winners, like five or six of those guys, and they all did it like they through at once, or they all took turnstoring, or they they had five catchers and five hockey players and they all threw it out at once. All right, so there's hope for us. Yeah, just don't look like fifty cent or Carl Lewis and you're all set. What do you mean those are two of the worst first pitches ever? Really happy? Well, I mean I would like we would probably practice for a while. I would practice a lot. Okay, Well, if you want to get in touch with us to have us throughout the first pitch of your professional MLB team's game, yeah not minor league, not interested? No, uh, we are happy to do so.
