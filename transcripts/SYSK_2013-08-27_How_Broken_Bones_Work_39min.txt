Josh: Brought to you by the all new Toyota Corolla. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and this is Stuff you Should Know the podcast Audio Adventure our great subtitle Chuck, have you ever broken a bone? I have not. You better knock on wood right this instant. Yeah, I could say the same thing, except I'm pretty certain that I've broken my small toe several times over the course of my life. Yeah, there's not all you can do about that there, right, No. I mean, like I didn't go see a doctor or anything like that, which is why I'm not certain I broke it. But I'm pretty certain just based on the amount of pain involved in it. Um. But other than that, you know, I've never had like a sling or anything like that. I was got cuts, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I was always stitched up in things, never broken back, stitches, leg foot, tongue, almost bit my tongue off. I've never had stitches. Really. Yeah, Well, you've lived a relatively healthy life, my friend. I guess so. And I mean it's not like I haven't been adventure Boy or anything like that. I've I've gotten in all sorts of REX accidents. If I had a brick fall on my head and put my arm through a storm window and I was a little baby. Um. I once was riding my awesome blue and yellow mag wheel BMX bike and went to go up a curb, but my brain misfired, and rather than pull up on the handlebars, I pressed down and went right over the handlebars hard. I've done that on a mountain bike. I played football. I got hit in the head with the baseball playing baseball. I'm It's not like I was like a milk toast or anything like that, like Bruce Willis, I wouldn't say that, just because I'm just too superstitious for that kind of thing. But I have not had stitches or a broken bump. But now I know all about broken bones and how they heal, because they do heal, and it's not just your saw bones that's healing them, like the heal on themselves. And it turns out medical science is basically just there to assist a beautiful, elegant, natural process that's already in place. Yeah, I think I'm just amazed at the body's natural healing capabilities. I think it's really neat. Um. I am too, Like you can regenerate your own tail, your vestigial tail, if you make it out of the womb with one of those. If if you lost your third nipple, it might just grow right back, your superfluous third nipple. Yeah. Uh so I guess you know, I am a few years away from being more susceptible. Apparently, men after forty five are more susceptible to breaking bones. And oh no, I'm sorry pre forty five, right, so I'm almost in the clear. Yeah, And I suspect that that is you to um, then being more active, yeah, um, because that's in men. If you're you're more susceptible to breaking a bone. Um. And then women are more susceptible to breaking a bone after that age yeah, when they reach menopause. Um. And the most commonly broken bone is what, uh, the wrist, right, yeah, the radius bone of the wrist. I guess from all the tennis people play. I think my theory on that is is that's how you know, It's a lot of that comes from trying to break your fall by putting your hand out, But that just happens a lot. It makes you wonder what bones we would break and how many more bones we break and we didn't have response to break. Well, if you or if you didn't try to break your fall, you just break your face over and over, I guess, um. And then in the elderly age, seventy five are over. According to this article by Robert Lamb m, hip fractures are the most common and those are painful. Yeah, I'm sure that's like, yeah, you hear about that lot. Very sad. Yeah, like fall in the bathtub, break the old hip. Um. So there's different types of fractures that can take place, right, Like there's not there's the simple fracture, which is the most um like the one you're if you're going to break a bone, this is the one you hope for. Um. But it is and it may even be the most common. I don't know if what's the most common. It's just a clean, simple break in one place only, right, and there's not like a bunch of other trauma or like associated pain or or well there's probably a lot of pain, but problems that come out of it's just like snap. And then there's a clean break that's a simple fracture. That's definitely not the only kind of fracture. No. The dreaded compound fracture, which I think strikes fear into the hearts of everybody, is when your bone is poking through your skin. Yeah, like Joe Tisman or the guy in the March Madness recently. I don't think I saw that one. Oh man, it is bad. I can't They're a mirror. Neurons kick in so hard when that stuff happens. There's this there's this animated gift of this, the footage of the guy he just fell down wrong, um and he fell down right in front of his own bench, and there's like the reaction of like the guys on the bench just like, oh, they all look like they're about to faint because they're like two ft away from like one of the worst things you could possibly see in an a live human. You know, it's awful. Yeah, But those that's a compound fraction, those are kind of dangerous because they can lead to infection pretty easily, by the way, you know, Joe, thisman, I don't know if this is true. Supposedly his name was pronounced Theisman until college, and he changed it to rhyme with Heisman in a push for the trophy. No way, I've heard that. I'm not sure. I need to look that up to verify it. That might be a an urban legend, could be, but I always call him Joe Theisman as a joke. But either way, the he the compound fracture came out of his thigh, didn't it. M I can't remember. I thought it was more like the knee. It was gruesome, remember, like seeing it live? I never saw it. Yeah, yeah, all right. So there's also the impacted fracture, when one end of the fracture, one end of the bone is driven into the other. That sounds pretty gnarly too. Yeah, that sounds really awful. A communuded fracture, Uh, that's when the bone shatters into fragments. That's probably that's pretty bad. Yeah, I'm sure fresh quite problematic, and as we'll find out, you'd probably end up a tad bit shorter if you have one of those in like your tibia, because you have to get rid of that stuff. Yeah, the bone fragments. There's the super cute green stick fracture. Yeah, this one to me was like, um, the same as imagining pulling back a fingernail. But then it retracting back. Yeah, this is a this is among children. It's a type of fracture specific to children where the bone like bends and snaps, but it doesn't fully break. Yeah, it cracks, but don't. It's like a green twig. Imagine that, like if you bend it, you can't really snap it into Oh that's why they call it that. Oh yeah, okay, yeah, green stick. That makes sense. The old timbertoe uh. And then an evolution fracture is um. Robert describes it as a powerful muscle contraction and it wrenches bone, intending forcing a fracture. That sounds pretty awful. Yeah, I looked this up. So basically what this is is your the muscles around your bone. In some instances, very unusual instances, can um contract so powerfully that it snaps the bone under what circumstance. So um, Normally, our muscles aren't powerful enough to snap bone because we have um neurological control over the muscles. Apparently, athletes can train beyond this point and can be at risk for an evulsion fracture by pushing their muscle muscles so hard that like they can make them powerful enough to snap their own bones. And in a very strong high jump or jump um, the tibia, the shin bone is particularly at risk for an evulsion fracture among highly trained athletes. Man, So imagine jumping so hard they snap your own bones with your mouth. That's crazy. Well, we learned in the when you get shocked, you know, like our body has that reserve, Like when you get shocked from and then blown across the room. That's actually not the power blowing across the room. That's your muscles are so strong and capable of doing that under the right circumstance, exactly like the potentials there, but we have a neurological filter that keeps us from doing that. And I looked that up to to see if there was like an association of evulsion fractures and electrocutions. They couldn't find anything. But it seems intuitive, doesn't it. Yeah? I think so. Yeah. And then finally the pathological fracture just the most dastardly of fractures. Um. It's when the bones are weakened by disease and really break pretty easily. They're brittle like osteoporosis killing, unbreakable. But Sam Jackson's character, yes, Mr what's his name? Mr Brittle like that. I can't remember, but he was, remember his bones broken very easily. That was the premise of that. At least was a really great It was a great movie. I really enjoyed. Actually, I thought it was like his only good movie. He didn't like The Sixth Sense, and I guess that was okay. That was a great It's hard to remember though, because he's sucked so much since then. I felt bad for that guy, and it's kind of great imagination, but um, yeah, I guess it's just I don't know what the problem is because he has He's made some great movies. At the Village. That was a really good movie. I didn't care for it. Are you kidding me? I didn't care for it. I thought that twist was amazing enough. With the twists with that guy, Oh well, that's the whole thing. One trick pony. No he's not. It's like calling oh Henry a one trick pony. There's twists like just having a twist. Alfred Hitchcock, Master of the twist, Master of the twist. I have a few other bone facts, just since we're talking about bones. Uh we know. I think we said it on our TV show even you're born with about three fifty bones and when you die you have two six because a lot of your bones fused together from when you're a little baby. Um in the hand, in the foot, in the thorax, in the vertibal crump, the what I just spaced out vertebral column rom and uh, only one in the throat. We have a bone in the throat apparently, so where you know right there you're touching it, that's my atoms apple. By twenty years old, we have a of our skeletal mass, and our bone density peaks at thirty and then starts going down the hill after that, right it does. But um, there's a lot of confusion out there. I assume that our skeleton stops growing. Yeah, and it does, Like we do reach a point where what did you say? Thirty thirty is where it peaks. So our skeleton has reached the it's full size. But that doesn't mean it stops producing um skeleton, new skeleton. Apparently every year a full ten percent of our skeleton is totally regenerated. Yeah, which we'll get to that process, okay. Uh. And then alcohol and smoking, um are no good for your bones. Um. You lose density and osteopenia, which is sort of like a pre asteoporosis, I guess, and that before I think, yeah, I think when I was a smoker, I knew that, Like it was bad for bones, it's definitely bad for teeth. And I'm sure the tour associated because I'll bet it's bone loss that makes your teeth fall out from smoking. Totally is um. And then I guess I've got some stuff on how to support your bones and good foods and stuff, but um, maybe we should do that at the end. Oh yeah, a happy ending. Okay, yeah, so chuck. Um, Well, we know virtually everything there is to know about bones, but we don't know how they work yet. We're about to, right, So, like I said, um, we regenerate about ten percent of our skeleton every year, and not the same time percent. It's just this constant process called bone remodeling. Yeah, our bones aren't just like dead sticks that are flesh and muscle are wrapped around there. It's living matter, just like the rest of your body. Right. And in addition to um the support and structure for your body um that the muscalo skeletal system provides, it's also your skeleton is a source for um storing minerals, sure, hard minerals um the marrow. There's two types of mirrow. There's red marrow where we create blood cells. Red blood sells yep um. And then there's also yellow marrow, where we store fat. Yeah, that just sounds gross. Fatty bones, fatty yellow marrow in our bones sounds cross to me. Have you ever eaten bone marrow? I know you it's like the butter of the gods, But have you ever tried it? No? I guess I should taste it. But yeah, you're gonna taste it one day. I will see to it. There's places that you can find bone marrow, and I urge you to go there. Yeah, you can get on your burger at a is it farm Burger indicator? Oh yeah, they do have marrow, don't they. Yeah. I think you actually ate one with marrow. I'm sure I did. Yeah. Yeah, I very rarely turned down marrow. Yeah, because I mean you, you can't find it everywhere, and it's very tough to screw up marrow. Okay, Well that's good to know anyway. In my opinion, fatty bone marrow sounds awesome in my Oh it does not, but I'll try. Did you pick that up at the folk festival. What in my oh? I don't think so, I because you've never said it before, and you said it twice today. I don't. I don't think that was like the phrase that was sweeping. It was a banner in the back, behind back in my O tour. I'm oh, yeah, I'm a I thought you're saying in my oh, I was. I'm just old and I don't know how these but I like the variation. Alright, So hold on, haunt. I'm still I haven't lost my train of thought yet. I've got it in reserve marrow. Well, we're past the marrow. The point is, the bone is a living structure. The thing is um. It can mineralize since the store of hard minerals. The bone can become a little too hard because it needs to stay living as well as rigid um. And so we do bone remodeling. So this process is basically a three step process. Right, So you've got the old bone that's become too hard. Ossified is what it's called. And um it's basically broken down by a type of um bone cell called osteoclasts. Yeah, they go around and chomp it up, right, and um absorb it. There's this part of the process is called resorbtion, and I guess they leave behind new cells and these new cells are um, I think they attract something called osteoblasts, which are a different type of bone cell, and they generate new bone tissue. That's right, and that is bone remodeling. Uh. And then you have you know, there's cartilage involve two and that's where condroblasts come in form the new cartilage. And between those three types of cells, you are regenerating your bone and uh, every day basically yes, Okay, so in the fact that we have this constantly going on, it's not that big of a deal to your bones to undertake this process of healing like this is. Those are the reasons why condro condro blasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts are the reasons why we can regenerate new bone once we break it. Yeah, and like from the moment you break your bone, it kind of starts to begin this process of healing itself, which is pretty great. And if you were like trapped in the woods and you could get it set sort of right, you're gonna probably be okay, Like you don't need a doctor. Well, you need a doctor in many cases. But before there were doctors, people still healed broken bones. Yeah, I mean the body does so. Yeah, And depending on how how well the whole thing went, you might be totally fine, yeah, or you might walk with a little hitchen your giddy hill. Right. Yeah. If it's the Middle Ages, you never know. So when when a bone breaks, there's the your body undertakes this process of regeneration. Um. There's three phases, that's right, three phases, right, and uh, the first phase is the actual break. And remember there's there's um blood vessels in your bones, yeah, surrounding the bone. So does break two. Yes, which that sounds bad, but it's kind of good. It is. The body says, I'm gonna make lemons lemonade out of the lemons that have just been dealt. Yeah, I'm bleeding profusely, but I'm gonna go ahead and take that blood, let it build up in the fissure in the crack um and create a cloth. Yeah, which helps. It's called a fracture hematoma, and that's the beginning of the healing process. It stabilizes everything, keeps it as lined up as possible, and cuts off the flow of blood. To those jagged edges there, right, And since the jagged edges lose blood flow, they start to die, and so the the I guess the parts of the fracture that are going to be the roughest just fall away and are reabsorbed. Yeah right, Yeah, it's gonna cause the swelling and inflammation because it's like everything's hard at work. All these cells are hard at work trying to you know, get all the dead tissue out of there. Uh. And then little tiny blood vessels are going to start to grow again. Um, they grow in the in the claw, so that now all of a sudden there's a transport system to this area, that's right. And that takes place over about three or four days. The sematoma um develops, right, that's right. Um, so that will develop into you know, it gets tougher as it goes and it forms something called soft callous um, which is sort of the beginning of I liken it to like an internal cast almost right, like the beginnings of it. And it gets harder and harder as this process goes on. Yeah, so you and this actually replaces the clock, like the clock kind of turns into the soft callous right, and the soft callous is the result of um, these things called fibroblasts which start producing collagen, and this collagen builds up and um, that's what develops your soft callous. That's right. It's kind of like, um, you have your skin, it's made of collagen. Yeah, it's a protein. Your bones apparently made of collagen to essentially it's the it's the base protein for bone and skin color. Where would we be without collagen? We would just be keeping mess on the floor, would be in zero's ville zero. Um. And then this so you've got the soft callous and then the soft callous is eventually replaced um with something called the fibro cartilaginous callous yea condroblasts or the cells that helped produce that. And again this is just a process of hardening and strengthening as the bones are lined up right, And all of it started with that hematoma, that clot and it was it's become replaced and then um, now it's getting a little harder, it's getting a little tougher, and I guess you have the fibro cartilage cartilaginous callous that remains and rather than being replaced by the bone callous the bone callous builds around it. Yeah, and that's the actual linking device that links the two pieces of the bone together. That's the bridge, right. And those osteo blasts that are responsible for um the bone remodeling that constantly goes on, they're the ones producing the bone callous and the bone alice. If the soft callous is the beginning of that initial cast, this is like the cast that your body builds for your bone, and it covers the area and allows that bone regeneration to take place in this completely protected area. Yeah. So the fibro cartilus callus is a few days, I'm sorry, a few weeks, and then the hard bone callous is three or four months. Right. That's why you when you have a cast on, you have to have your cast for several months or at least a couple of months, usually long enough for a distinct Yeah, and it should get ants inside. Yeah. I remember being a kid and being jealous of kids who got their cast signed in things because it was always, you know, the kid would show up, they get a lot of attention, and everyone would sign their cast and it was just a big thing. And I never broke my bone, and I was just like I want to break a bone. Do you do? You even remember the Simpsons where Bart has a cast for the summer Man. It is season two, three four something like that. It's one of the best ones ever because simultaneously I think, um, I guess the Simpsons get a pool too, and everybody's having so much fun in the pool, but Bart can't get in and there's like a rear window like rear window thing going on with him. Um, right, because Jimmy Stuart was in the wheelchair, right yeah, um. But Millhouse comes over and Bart's like, mill House, my trust of friends, you won't leave me, Willie, and he's signing Bart's cast. He's like, I gotta go Bart, and they show his signature. It says Millpool. Anyway, that's the Simpsons episode. That's good. It's a good one. And when I was a kid too that they still had them early on, they still had the plaster cast you know that we're really easy to sign, and then they kind of I don't even know what they're made of now, but it looks more like, ah, like fibrous, you know. Whatever's hard. It's harder to sign though. Yeah, it's not like the old days. No, but don't They have like designs and colors and stuff they so kids can like get funky with their casts. I'm sure they do. Actually I've never seen it, but that makes total sense. Make broken bones fun like band aids and stuff. All Right, So, um, we've got our bone callous. That is when the healing is really going on. That is the stable protection, the interior cast as it is or as it could be. Right, and you could leave that alone. Yeah, and like you said, risk dying or having a lamp or something like that. You can take a chance if you wanted, right, But if medical science is anything it's interventionist. So they come in and they say, we're gonna help this process along as best as we can. And a lot of times it's as simple as creating a cast, which basically forms that protective layer and keeps kids from doing stuff that's fun while their bone is reproducing itself. Yeah, they're gonna diagnose you. They're gonna immobilize it with that cast and make sure it's all in proper alignment. Um, maybe a splint, maybe a sling, maybe a brace, whatever it takes, depending on like where the break is, how bad it is, how old you are, and horrifically. It's probably painful. Yeah, because your bone, if it's not in alignment, when you go to see the doctor, they have to make sure that it is in alignment, which means that they're going to physically force it back into alignment, which means you're gonna pass out from the pain if they don't give you something beforehand. Yeah. I've also heard I should have looked this up, that if it's not healing right, they'll rebreak it. Sometimes that true, imagine. Yeah, I've heard that it seems like a new someone that had that happen surgical break. Yeah, I think so, I'll have to look at a medical break. I bet that's happened. Uh, you might need traction, which um, I never really knew what traction was. I thought traction was just, hey, I need to keep my leg elevated for a period of time. But it's not just that. It's actually weights and ropes and pulleys like pushing in, pulling constantly to make sure it stays in alignment and maintains that alignment. Right. So like if you have um a leg where the break is trying to go um one, the lower part is trying to go up and the upper part is trying to go down. You would have a pully pulling on the lower part and the upper part pushing on the upper part, pulling each away, so that it's constantly in alignment. Right, it's got to be painful, I would imagine. I can't imagine traction is fun. There is a kind of traction that bears your last name, Bryant traction. Yes, and it's as cute as possible. It's for little kids only who suffered um femur or hip breaks and their tiny little legs have to both be up in the air at a ninety degree angle of their pelvis. And it's heartbreakingly adorably sad uh to see a little kid in Bryant traction because they're all like four. Um, and I've seen pictures because I looked up traction And if you want to see a really disturbing PDF, that's not intended to be disturbing, it's just forthright medical photos. It's um. Look go on to Lancaster General College dot E d U and look up traction and Orthopedic Care by a guy named Rothicker. And um, it's it's just basically how to and like different types of traction and attractions kind of become abandoned largely by the medical profession. It was, you know, kind of big in the twentieth century and I think we've kind of outgrown it largely. Um. But there are some old timey torturific looking at traction devices out there, like that the head tongs, you know, like an ice tong they used to deliver like three students delivered ice. They have those for your head to like hold your head in in alignment with your spinal column for however long it needs to be if you break your back. There's some it's just really kind of weird to see. But there's little kids in Bryant Attraction and that he uh, you know, I bet our friends, um, you know, from my brother and my brother and me, Justin McElroy. He and his wife now Sidney, who's a doctor, have a new podcast called Sawbones. Oh yeah, I saw that. It's really good. It's basically Sitney and Justin are both just fascinated by antiquated medical practices and that's like the entire podcast. And I guess you'd probably get that on like bulls Eye, right, Bull's Eye website, yeah, or or iTunes. It's really good and they they sweetly said that they were inspired by us and as far as delivering like educational slash funny podcasts. Sweet. Yeah, so it's pretty cool. Um yeah, okay, h surgery surgery, Oh that's another thing. If you are in traction. There's two kinds of attraction. Their skins attraction, which is basically like they attached the ropes and the pulleys and stuff to using medical tape or like a boot or a sling or something thing. Then there's skeletal traction where they go in and attach pins, rods, needles to your bone. Yeah, that's if pretty severe breaks require this. Usually you don't need surgery to repair a bone, but if you do, that means you're gonna be getting like bolts and pins and things inserted to keep everything properly aligned. And while your in traction, your muscles are doing jack yeah, which means they atrophy, which means you're gonna have to go through rehab yeah, which which is good. Like um and rehab, you know, they specialize in just enough work two build up your muscle and cartilage and tendons again, but you still have to respect the break. So it's like it's a very delicate line. They're walking here with what kind of rehab you can do? You know? Um, So broken bones can lead to it's not always just as easy as your bone is broken, let's HeLa. There can like the complications you can die from, like a broken hip. Yes, Sadly, as apparent, only one third of hip related hip break related deaths are come from that hematoma. Huh, that's sad And I think probably what happens, um when you have that fracture hematoma and a hip, you're still moving around a little bit. So what that's called, though, is a pulmonary embolism. That's when that clot moves up and blocks like arteries to your lungs, and that's where the death results from. Obviously, if you have a compound fracture, infection is pretty big risk. Uh, if you break ribs, they can puncture organs or if they're not properly said or not healing right, they can you know, squeeze out organs and uh lead to like tissue damage and things like that. That's no good. And then there's something called fibro dysplasia assif cans progressive or fo P. It's a genetic condition with a life expectancy of about forty years of age and basically chuck that bone remodeling process goes haywire. There's a genetic mutation to where any kind of trauma to your tissue triggers bone regeneration at the site, So like your muscle is turning into bone, your muscle, your skin, your fat. Those pictures man like it showed a skeleton bear skeleton that had had had this disease, and it's like, there's it's like skeleton plus think what you're used to looking to plus a lot more. Yeah, um, and it's very sad condition. There's UM. I think there's They believe only about seven people in the world have fo p UM and most of them are incorrectly diagnosed with things like cancer because cancer can do all sorts of wacky stuff to bones UM as a secondary condition UM, and so they get all sorts of unnecessary treatment like chemotherapy and things like that. UM, even when you're having cancer, even when it is UM correctly diagnosed. It's basically like parents are forced to choose like, okay, am, I gonna try to keep you alive as much as possible and make you live in a bubble or am I gonna say, you know, I want you to live your life and you can go out and get a bruise and inoculation, um, get punched in the arm and all of those things. Those sites are going to turn to bone. A bruise creates a bone there at the site, your joints lock up and then you you lose use of that that limb. Yeah, I saw the one guy interviewed. It was just like, you know, he can't walk around, he can't lay down comfortably. It just really just locks you up. Yeah, it's a really terrible, horrific condition. But now that they've discovered the gene mutation associated with it, they really feel like the next generation of fo P patients are gonna have a lot better quality of life than the ones alive today. Yeah. And there's a girl um in Peachtree City who has it, who's just kind of a plucky survivor. That's here in Georgia. By the way, how are you not know it's in Georgia. It's called Peachtree City. That's where everybody drives golf carts around. Oh really, Yeah, you didn't know that that's the home of Club Car, the golf cart company. Yeah, and for some reason, like Peachtree City, I guess to celebrate club car built a bunch of like paths like all over the city. That's how you get around down there. From what I understand, Yeah, well that's neat. Yeah. Uh so she has it in Peachtree Cities because it's like super super rare, right, yeah, like seven people worldwide. How's she doing? She's doing okay. Like I said, she's plucky. From what I understand that she was the U. The centerpiece of the article on it that I read on ABC News called um turned to bone rare condition lacks victims in second eton um. It's pretty interesting, boy, seeing the attitude of people that have things like this happened, Like that's the inspiration, right we had. I don't know if you saw the email a guy wrote in yesterday that cut off four of his fingers with a table saw and UM had medical leeches used as part of the thing, and like sending pictures. It was really gnartly. Oh I missed that. But this guy was like smiling in the picture and he's like, you know what, A lot worse things can happen. He's like they weren't able to reattach the fingers I got a nub I can still play bass guitar with. And he's got this really really rad artificial finger that he sent a picture of, like a robotic finger. And uh again, just like the attitude, Emily always make jokes about them, like the living will and you know, like, what do you want to do in case the situations I'm like, if I break a few bones and I'm in traction, I was like, just go ahead and put me out there. I'm just the biggest complainer and was like, with that stuff, I need to work on my my attitude. In case of like bad situations like that, you should probably specify on record put you out means like kill you or like give you a bunch of drugs. Oh, right, because that's that could lead to a lot of disagreement later on, a right could lead to some good times. Right, that will change your attitude? Get anything else? That's it? Man. Oh by the way, Evil Kinevel did not break every bone in his body. That's look that up. That's not true. Really now he broke apparently thirty five bones' career. That's not that much, which is that's a lot. He also used to punch out like reporters he didn't like, apparently, and break bones in his hand doing so. I guess McConaughey was going to play him in a biopic. At one point I thought that was pretty good casting. Who else, Yeah, biopic? Maybe Josh Lucas. What's wrong with biopic? Biopic? That's that's what that's by. We've had this conversation before, what whether it's biopic or biopic? And what did we settle in? I say biopic, and I said biopic, but I think I just said biopic. Maybe you know you said biopic? Jerry, can we get a ruling? Jerry says no, I wasn't paying attention. I got nothing else. Then, okay, well that's broken Bones. That was a good one. Yeah, I think so. I never really knew. I mean, I knew they healed themselves. But it's a pretty fascinating stuff and if you want to learn more about it, you can check out this article by Robert Lamb on how Stuff Works dot com. Um just type in broken bones and it will bring it up. And since I said Robert Lamb, that means it's time for message break. Now, how's about some listener mail? Chuck? Yeah, this is from a female rugby player, so it probably fits with broken bones. I bet she's broken a bone. And I didn't know that ladies played rugby, so I was happy to learn this.

I play for our women's rugby team in Chicago, called the Chicago Sirens. Rugby is a newish sport for me, but I have to say it's one of the most fun things I've done since moving here. Anyway, our team has been invited to play in the Safari Sevens tournament in Nairobi, Kenya, which is an extreme privilege. Uh. The Safari Sevens is Africa's premier rugby tournament and is open only to teams that receive formal invitations and draw crowds of over people. Wow. We are currently the only US team that's been invited to play in the tournament, which is awesome. Uh. In addition, we are the first women's team outside of Africa to ever receive an invitation to play, and it's really cool opportunity for US. That is an extreme well, what what'd you say, an extreme way privilege? Yeah? Okay. The only problem is, guys, we are a self funded team, the news catch and UH we have a ton of fundraising to do in order to get ourselves there. Because you think she was just bragging, Now I knew. Would you guys be willing to mention our tour website on your Facebook page or on Twitter for sure, or better yet, on the podcast first? So you got it, she says, I know it's a total long shot, but this trip would be like a dream come true and a girl's gotta try. Um, your Kenyon bound fan, Jamie, So Jamie, here's your plug if you guys want to help support women's rugby and uh get them to Africa based participate USA for this, Yeah, pretty much.
