Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant that makes the stuff you should know. It feels like it's been forever since we've been in the studio. Yeah, this chair, my chair no longer stinks. They had time to air out. And you know I've said it before, I'll say it again. If we could roll the first three minutes before we actually hit record on this puppy, Yeah, man, well gold do you think? I think? What are the ones they give for a spoken word? You can get a Grammy for that, sure, or if it's like videotaped and broadcast on TV, you can conceivably get an Emmy for it. We I think we could win every award with our three minutes before and after we record, and people out there and they're like, oh, I want to hear it so bad. To get this, that's it. This is what you get and you'll like it for your freness. Right all right, by the way, go like us on Facebook, call you It would help us out personally, Chuck and I would be helped out. If you go on to Facebook dot com slash stuff. You should know our Facebook page and like us, like get us to fifty can you please get us to the gent And for the gentleman who said that it makes him want to unlike it because we ask people to like it. Just what's going on, buddy, what's going on in your life? So it's called marketing. You're ready, Yeah, you're ready. Let's market some agri tourism. I have an intro. Let's hear it. So back in two thousand and seven, the little newsine may have slipped past because it was south of the border Florida. Um. A guy named that's usually Mexico. When you say that, By the way, again, if we're not in Texas, we're in Georgia, So south of the border means Florida, Okay. A guy named Ronald Levins Sr. And his wife Jequita Evans got some pretty hefty time. Ron Evans got thirty years for what amounted to indentured servitude. Right. This guy ran some Florida labor camps where people would go and like this is where they would stay and bunk and eat at night, and then during the day they get bus to farms to work right Orange Groves wherever. I think lettuce is big there too. Um the that's all legal and kosher. They they even actually employed the homeless. They would go around to Miami, Baton Rouge, New Orleans. I don't think they came to Atlanta, but they went to big cities in the southeast and recruited homeless people living on the street and said, hey, we can give you a job. You know. Yeah. The problem came with the indentured servitude part. They had a company store at their labor camp and it sold a gallon of wine for forty bucks. And you should know right off the bat that you can't get a good gallon of wine that's all cheap. So they had really inflated prices. Cigarettes were through the roof, and the crack cocaine was above market value. The stuff they sold at the company's store that they eventually got all the guys addicted to gave them advances of crack against their paychecks and basically got these guys mired in debt to where they were indentured servants slaves. He's got the guy finally got busted. He was a really smart dude. Yeah, because he was running him not just in Florida, but North Carolina. Uh and uh possibly South Carolina as well. He's like, I've discovered something really really great. So that um is the exact opposite of agratourism, and that's your setup. That's pretty good. Uh. I thought I didn't see where that was going because the whole time I was sinking. All right, that's fine, he's paying these people, gets homeless people, put them to work, puts them up in a in a bunk. What's what's the problem forty gallon of wine? Well, the crack is kind of a big problem too. He had all the farmers paying him in cash in return for the labor, so he could go buy massive amounts of crack. So the company's store never ran out of crack from what I understand. Well, and they were probably fairly secluded, you know, it's probably the only store around. They probably didn't have cars. No, they probably depended on that store they did and that crack. Yes, So, like I said, that's the opposite of agraa tourism. What is the positive the the I guess what is agri tourism. Well, it's when you want to attract guests and visitors to come to your business, your farm, to either observe or actually take part in the business, the family business. Okay, let's go. Is that good? That's it. That's that was agra tourism explained. Like you know, let's just give it one example. Say you can go to California and you can stay at a winery and instead of just kicking back on the porch all day and sampling wine, you can go out and you can pick the grapes and you can learn how it's done and in the hand and uh eat eat the food that's produced there. Maybe if it's a farm, that kind of thing. So I think sideways, the film was entirely bankrolled by the California Agritourism cartel, I think so. I mean, think about it, like the whole movie is about an agritourism trip that's essentially not even essentially like that is in every way agritourism. Like they went from one one winery to another winery. They watched the grapes get stomped. Did they even did they participate in grape stomping? I don't remember, I don't remember, But did you ever see that video on YouTube. Oh yeah, the woman stomping grapes. Yeah, here in Atlanta. Yeah, it was Fox five that it happened on. And have you seen Keyboard cat Player out d d d Dodo Doo ding do. Yeah, it's pretty It's really sad because she seems genuinely hurt. But the noise that she makes, it's once, you hear it once, it is stuck in your crawl forever. Yeah. Yeah, that's grape stompings. So that's a that's a pretty good example of agri tourism right and wrong. I think we should well, yes, in her case, in her case, but Sideways is a good um example. I took that tour, did I know? No, No, No, that was northern California. We we did the little that Sideways was done in southern like Santa Barbara. Oh I thought it was in Napa Valley. No, no, it was in It was in Napa where it was. Well, then all those places I went to that we're in the movie must have been wrong in the movie. It was supposed to be Napa. Five dollars okay. Actually, actually well, to h the one winery with the guy with a big beard, I actually hung out with that guy for like an hour of drinking wine, the dude from the movie, and like we were the only people in there. The sun was setting. It was one of those magical moments that sounds touching. So chuck, Um, what's the what's the point of agriturism, Well, it helps there. Well, it's because farmers are having to diversify a little bit in most cases to make dough. Yeah, I read an exactly. Well, with the advent of the factory farm, right, we've got very a very small percentage of farms number wise, right, Um, say one factory farm equals one farm that's an enormous farm. Uh, in both like revenue and you know, acreage production. Um, they represent a very small number of the number of farms, but just proportionately large, um total of the revenue made and of the stuff produced in the US. Right. So that's industrialization, right, And one of the one of the other aspects of industrial I know where you're going next, but one of the other aspects of industrialization is um apparently you have to have a gross revenue of fifty grand a year from your farm to start to actually be able to sustain your family through farming. Seventy in two thousand seven seventy five. No, I'm sorry. This year, se of farms in the US made less than fifty grand a year. So this is one of the reasons why they're saying, well, I don't really want to give up farming and become a city slicker because I hate city slickers, but I like city slickers money. So let's supplement our income and start some agritourism. Yeah, yeah, that's a great reason. What's the other reason that farmers are being forced to go into agritourism. I'm glad you asked globalization because with the way shipping is now in communication around the world and things move at the speed of light, you're not just competing with the farm like in your county or in your state. You're competing with like a farm across the universe from yourself for the world. In the world. The world's fat enough. Don't bling the galaxy into this. You're you're in big trouble, moon farmer. We get in intergalactic competition moisture farmers. So we've got globalization, industrialization. Those are pretty much the two big drivers of agritourism. But you know, you can't put it past farm folks to to be um well smart and farm smart, and that what they call it. I never heard that, but I love that term. I thought i'd picked that up from you. Are you sure? No, I never have heard that before. Well there's farm smart, farm strong. No, No, that's lived strong, farms smarts. So chuck. Um. There's a few different ways that this can pan out. Right, Let's say you're at the dollar level and you don't care about new stuff. You're just fine sewing your old clothes. But you want to keep farming. Um, you would you would use agritourism as like a supplementary income, right, Yeah, just add a little like you might do tours things like that. And you know I should add that when I was a kid. Was it Robert that wrote this, Robert Lamb? Yeah, it's an unusually thin article from Robert Lamb of stuff to blow your mind. Well, he makes a point early on that, um, it provides a connection that people has been lost between the stuff we put in our body and in the person. Yeah. Because and I've read that and it really hit home because when I was a kid, and this wasn't in like the nineteen twenties, we got our milk from a farm right here in Atlanta, and it wasn't weird. Like we drove to this farm and they had you pull up to the cooler room and there was a guy standing there on the porch and he would just ask what you need and he'd go in the cooler room and go get it for you. And it wasn't like I didn't live in I was in a hill billy And it wasn't the nineteen twenties. This is like in the eight seventies and eighties in in Decabb County, Georgia. Yeah, but now, I mean that seems really weird. Or get anything outside of the grocery, It's not weird. It's more like token. It's like a token experience, right. Yeah. And that that's that's, by the way, is direct marketing aggrotourism, where like you drive to the farm and like you just pull up to a farm stand or something that's down the side of the road. Um. But yeah, we were talking about what's driving agro tourism from the farmer's point of view, but you just touched upon what's driving it from the consumers point of view. And yeah, this whole farm to table movement huge. Well yeah, and it's having it's it's it's the perfect time for aggri tourism because I think it was, was it two thousand eight or nine? Very recently, um, the world population tipped towards cities the first time ever more people lived in cities than in a rural area. Right, the sticks, the sticks. So we're we're we're getting further and further away from our country roots. Right. People won't walk around barefoot anymore, people wear shirts underneath their overalls. It's just you know, urban um. So, I guess this desire to be able to go back to the farm, uh is is definitely part of of why this is why consumers are going there right. Well, and Robert makes a point which is very valid, which is especially if your family, if that was your roots, your ancestry, you may not know anything about that, and it might be a neat way to get in touch with your your ancestry and your roots. Go back. See what it's like the milk a cow because great great granddad did that for a living. Sure, pretty cool. Yeah, you can feel your great great granddad's ghosts looking over your shoulder like you're doing it wrong. Right, You got a yank down and to the left. I've never a milky cow. I don't know how to do it. So you've got supplementary. Uh, there's complementary, which is where it's about half and half. And a good example of this kind of aggri tourism outfit is a pumpkin patch, right, so like they may sell half of their pumpkins to you know, a wholesaler, and then they may keep half of them for the fall tours. And people can walk around and pick their own pumpkin and then carve it and have some snotnose teenager come and smash it, and some awful band will name their band after that act. Jerry just left it and she's like mentioned smashing pumpkin, and so that's complimentary. And then there's primary. And primary is the one where your farm is growing nothing but weeds, right, nothing you can sell, and you turn it into an agriturism destination. Like you all, almost all of your income is coming from the fact that there are people coming to your farm growing stuff. Though well you are you have to like grow something, but it doesn't necessarily have to be sellable, right, as long as people think it looks pretty, then you're fine. Sure. Now there's Back in the director of the U C. Davis's Small Farms program publicly worried that if ranchers and um farmers didn't get in on the Agora tourism action soon enough, the market was going to be open wide enough for like theme park operators to do this, which would be the primary enterprise aspect. And there's a guy who's a former Disney exact who actually started a company to make mazes that take about two hours to get to on farms. Yeah, well, that's that's huge. The corn maze in the fall, that's aggri tourism, buddy. Yeah. Yeah, have you ever done one of those? I haven't. They haven't been terrified at the thought of like getting trapped in there forever? Really? Yeah? Wow? Mazes? Huh. I don't like mazes. I bet the end of the shining is pretty harrowing for you. Huh No, because I'm not there, but yeah, sure, like my I've got like three mirror neurons. If you're Danny, though, then it would have been frightened. I would have just laid down and died and they come kill me. Dad think a quit. Uh So. Robert likens it to eco tourism, which is um, not too far off. Whn't you think they both have tourism in the name. Well, yeah, And the cool thing about um, aggro tourism and eco touris are actually more aggroturism is you don't have to necessarily throw a lot of money into it as a farmer, because you've got the farm you Sometimes you just got to open the gates and advertise it, say, come to our apple farm and pick some apples. So it's not like you gotta sink a lot of money into an enterprise. And um, one of the I think one of the rules of thumb, if you're a agri tourism farmer and you're actually trying to sell some of your stuff too, you want to keep the littlest kids like occupied away from your protest because apparently they represent a huge portion of shrinkage. Yeah, so I guess petting zoos are the best way to do it. It is because if you've ever wanted to watch a small child inadvertently kill a rabbit by petting it too eagerly, then agro tourism is right up your alley. That doesn't happen, Sure it does. That's awful. Kids and their rough love they just don't know. Let's talk about some different types of agro tourism checkers. Well, you mentioned the direct market, which is like fruit stands, that kind of thing. Um. Robert calls this one education and experience, and this is more along the lines of like a bed and bright like seren By, you know, Sara By, South Atlanta. I saw, Yeah, it's pretty cool. You know, they have an apprenticeship to that lasts from March to November. Yeah, I looked it up. Pays eight hundred bucks a week plus housing and utilities, and they teach you the ins and outs of organic farming, UM, keeping farm records. Like it's it's pretty well organized. It sounds like there's actually, while we're on that, there's UM. If you go onto the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service site and then search sustainable farming internships and apprenticeships, it brings them up for the entire country. Yeah. So if you're into this kind of thing, if if you want to be like an ag culturist rather than an a tourist, it's it's out there for you. You know, if I was fifteen years younger and single, you would find me down at Serenby Living, right, is that right, Yeah, man, I'd love that really. Yeah, it's gorgeous down there. So that's the idea of like the bed and breakfast package where they say, hey, stay at our bed and breakfast and work a little bit on our farm and learn how to turn butter and eat the food that we serve you that's straight from the farm from the table. Yeah. You saw that one Maverick Farm and and uh Carolina, Yeah, yeah, I love that. Throw throw that down. It's in Valley Crucis, North Carolina, and it's a bed and breakfast. It's situated in a hundred and forty year old, hundred and twenty five year old farmhouse right. Uh. And it's a hundred and twenty bucks at night for a room. But you can work off up to I think bill at seven bucks an hour by acting as farm labor. I love farm hand. And then you eat with the family in their home every night, stuff that they grow. Yeah, And they said that you can and it's an option if you want to donate a little money back for the meal, you can. Well I'm trying to picture you there. You'd be like, aw, you're working twenties a good rate. I'll just be here on the porch watching you people work. I'm paying to watch other people work on a farm. Uh. And then the other type is recreation an event agriturism, and that's um more like the Big Fall Festival, corn mazes, pumpkin picking, hay rides, sheep here in contest did they have those awesome yeah pie eating contest. Yeah. Basically, if there's an event that you're attending and um, say a pageant and it's miss and then insert your own vegetable, that's the miss uh squash of Canton or whatever. That kind of thing. Another one that was pretty cool that um he mentions in here is the U. S Department of Agriculture operates one called home Place by the Lakes National Recreationary in Tennessee. And they go a step further and combine a little like Colonial Williamsburg in with it. They'll dress up instead of a Civil War reenactment, they'll be dressed up in the old school clothes showing you how to churn butter. Imagine like the AMAS should probably be like, dude, that's our life. Have you come watch us? You read exactly? Um, it's like the opposite of rum Springer. Yeah, Um, that's what we just figured out the key to a tourism. It's the opposite of rum Springer. Have have you ever seen the alig episode Um where Barat goes to like a living history farm in South Carolina. I strongly recommend that one. It's hilarious. Uh. There's another one called the Conner Prairie Living History Museum, which is sort of what you're talking about right there. This one's pretty serious. Yeah. This is in Fisher's, Indiana, and there's an outdoor museum and you can see how things operated in the eighteen hundreds. And then they go a little step further and they actually have a program called Follow the North Star which allow as you the chance to see what it was like to be a slave trying to escape. Yeah, which I wonder how they do that. I think they have guys and dogs running after you. Really, yeah, tracking you. That's what I took from it. Yeah, that's that's tricky. I mean, that's living history right there. I don't know if I want to do that. Can you see yourself running through the woods like hete agritourism. This is horrible, So, Josh. One of the ideas behind agriturism is that people will be so uh, inspired by their trip, that it will form sort of a relationship with the farm and that they will want to support that farm even after they have left the farm. This appears to be like a long term goal of agritourism. It's not just short term. It's more like they want to remind the city slickers that farms still exist and that the city slickers are welcome to come by and empty their wallets there, like keep coming back again and again. And actually that works because I was raised as an agritourist um going to McQueen orchard in Holland, Ohio pick apples, and still to this day, like my family when we visit Ohio, we'll go to McQueen's. We scheduled it around the time where the apples are ripe, amazing, best donuts in the entire world. Like I kid you not, Yes, everything is just perfect. They're just go go to McQueen apple fritters to be apple fritters, apples there, apple cider is just I mean, and the apples themselves. You just climb the trees and pick them and eat them and you know, take off your shirt and it's awesome. Uh So, where I was going though with the with the repeat businesses. Um, you've heard of the the c s A, the community supported agriculture programs. Yeah, and that's when you sign up as a collective. While you sign up personally, you form a collective as a whole. And um, you basically pay money up front to get a box of vegetables like once a month. I mean, the programs are different delivered to your home or sometimes you go pick them up. And the cool thing is, and you should know this because some people might not think it's so cool, is you don't know what you're gonna get. Yeah, but you get a lot of what you don't know what you're gonna get. Well, yeah, so you gotta be open minded. You gotta be willing to experiment with vegetables you may never have cooked with before. It's probably a good idea to know how to can things because you really get a lot of stuff. This is one of the things I've always heard from people who have co op subscriptions that like all this scale, all this scale. Tennessee Tech has a program. They say that they're the first university in the state of Tennessee to offer a degree in agriturism because they say this is the future, and you're gonna need managers and people that know the trends in this business. I think this represents the people who are like theme parks are going to get into this. You think like let us land that kind of thing. No, I wouldn't call it that, but possibly. Uh. I got a couple of stats for you. Yeah, yeah, it's successful, right, Well, yeah, I got one for the state of Colorado. At least they say that agritourism contributed two point two billion dollars to their state's economy and that thirteen point two million visitors engaged in one in last year in agritourism in Colorado. It's pretty awesome. So the one I have is from the two thousand seven U s Senses of agriculture three thousand, three hundred fifty farms in the US. I have some sort of agritourism thing going on, right, and about thirty six hundred of those were making grand or more a year from it. Yeah, this billion number seems really suspecting me. I wonder if it's not a million for Colorado. Yeah, because the the total for all of the US and two thousand seven five sixty six million, I don't know if that was gross revenue, because it sounded like your stat was um like economic impact. That would include like the gas people coming into the state. Yea, you know the hotels that they stayed in when they were picking apple. But that's what the Colorado State Extension Service said. Well, they're pretty well known to be rather liberal with their numbers hippies. So let's see what else, Chuck, I don't have much else, do you The greatest winery scene of all time? Not in Sideways, the British comedy series Absolutely fabulous. Oh yeah, and you know I didn't watch that show. I knew it was supposed to be great, but in that particular episode was hilarious. Well, I think going through a winery is a great way to uh participate in negraatorism. And not just wineries. They have um like homegrown breweries now too. What like brewery people grow the hops on their land and make the beer and you drink it. Yeah. I'd like to go to the sire Nevada plant. I would say it's one of my goals in life. Find where they make that sweeten nectar. Have you been to uh Sweetwater? Uh? No? I never suck right down the street. It's like a good little happy, our place. That's what I hear. Yeah, it's fun, give you tastings and all. That is that aggrotourism. No, not really, not at all. Industrial tourism maybe yeah, that's visiting a brewery. So that's it. That's agritourism plus a touch of industrial tourism, just as an extra little nugget. That was free as it was alright. So if you want to learn more about agritourism, read an article by Robert Lamb. Just to complete the series, you can type in agritourism a g R I tourism in the handy search bart how stuff works dot com? And support your local farm. Get on the internet and there's something near nearby. Yeah, there's a ton of stuff. Oh and actually, what's that website? You got one? I do um. I gave you the one for the apprenticeships. If you want to actually be the person working that people are gawking at. Right, if you want to gawk at people working on a farm, go to rural Bounty. Are you are a l bounty dot com? I thought it would be aggrigawker the same thing. Okay, it's time now for administrative details. You're ready? Should we set this up for people who don't know what this means because it's the worst title ever. It is not. It's very sustinct and to the point. These are gifts thank you as from fans that send us things in and hopes that we will promote their little Etsy site. Well not just gifts like sometimes correspondence correspondence postcards.
