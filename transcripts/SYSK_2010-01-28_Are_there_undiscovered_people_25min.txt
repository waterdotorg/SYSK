Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as Charles W. Bryant. I'm always there for you, Josh as always. Yes, I'm contractually obligated today. I know, I know, I know. So Chuck, you doing are Yeah, dude, how are you doing? Pretty good? It's Thursday, it's not Friday, but it's a little gray out for my tastes. Yeah, it's sprinkling, by the way, I thought it was like pouring rain. Is it sprinkling? It's sprinkling. That's good. So, um, Chuck, do you remember can we go back year or so May two, eight? How many years after Ghostbusters? Let's see how it was? And yes, we do know that there is a four years a sequel coming by the way, Yes, Ghostbusters three. That's gonna be awesome. Should be the entire original caste except for Sigourney Weaver, which that's okay. Um, yeah, Ghostbusters three coming out? Right? Where are we So we're we're twenty four years after Ghostbusters? And um, the news cycle had this kind of strange occurrence where a bunch of undiscovered human beings were splashed across the front pages of newspapers everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, so there's this photo. There are several photos of these people living in um primitive huts actually primitive longhouses is what it looks like. Uh. And they are the it's an aerial photo taken from a low flying helicopter and they are piste. They have their like aiming their bows and arrows at the at the camera. Like see the picture is pretty cool, yea, like get out of here. Um. And so yeah, like this this whole thing made the made the news cycle. And Chuck, I imagine I take from what you said before we started recording that you have a tad bit of disdain for the let's see journalism that was applied to this. Yeah. Well, first of all, should we go ahead and refute it? Why not? Because they were not, in fact under undiscovered people. No, And there's actually a huge, huge distinction between undiscovered people and uncontacted or isolated people, right right, But you would not know that by reading the Independent from London, which I'm disappointed because I like that paper. No, I'm sorry, I could care less about the Independence The Guardian Like, yeah, you like the Guardian, not the Daily Mail the Independent. Uh. Here's here's how the article opens up. Beneath the picture of the you know, clearly savage and everything, with the arrow pointing at the helicopter, three near naked figures are visible in the forest clearing. Two of them are in their bodies daubed with a red dye and are aiming their bows at the sky. A third figure appears to be a woman, her body blackened and only her pale hands and face betraying her natural color. This remarkable photograph is the first proof of existence of one of the world's last uncontacted tribes. So they do say uncontacted. That's good, but not everybody did, though sure it's a little overblown. That was a fine dramatic reading their chuck. I think the funniest thing that would have happened is if he would have shot that arrow and it would have somehow disrupted the propeller of the helicopter and it would have, you know, landed safely on the beach for them to be eaten. That would have been a nice ending. There are tons of rumors of cannibalism about undiscovered purple right. Um. In this specific case, there is a guy named Carlos dos race Moreles. My Spanish is a little rusty, but I think that's about right. Um. And uh he is an Indian expert. I just made air quotes and these photos were taken in Brazil, right Um. This guy laid the search for this tribe, right and um. As the as I guess he kind of watched with horror hopefully as they were described as undiscovered and knowing had ever found them before. He's he came out and was like, wait, wait, now I've been following these people for the last twenty years, so they're not undiscovered. See, I thought he that was part of the deploy for him. That was he taken aback by that, you think? I thought, maybe that's how we got the funding to get the research team, by saying that we'll find out. Well, let's talk about it. Is it even possible to be undiscovered? Well that's what this podcast is about, buddy. And you know what, it's kind of impossible these days. Yeah. We have things like GPS, we have things like heat sensors that can be attached to airplanes, which you know, body heat sensors. Um. There is almost complete and total encroachment and harnessment of any square parcel of land on the planet. Yeah, most everywhere. But that doesn't mean that there aren't people who are who live outside I guess the French, who live primitively and remain in a I guess primitive state. These are the uncontacted people. Yeah, isolation. Basically, they first they called them undiscovered, then they say uncontacted, and then they finally settle on isolated, which means more than anything is they don't want any part of us, Yeah, and that we don't want a part of them, because we're always interested. We are, and usually with um murderous results. Right. Yeah, these people have learned the hard way. Um. And some of these uncontacted tribes also, we should say, don't even we have no idea what they call themselves. Right. So there's this there's a group actually called Survival International, and they are dedicated to preserving indigenous ways of lives these tribes, for these for uncontacted tribes who have rejected modernization. Right, because that's the thing you think about it, when it's undiscovered or they're uncontacted, you you kind of pointed out, we just tend to think like, oh, they don't know about civilization or you know, these poor fools they don't know about you know, television or running theft Auto six And they would clearly be better off if we gave them TV, or made them Christians, or or did whatever you know, made them slaves. Yeah, which we have a fine, fine tradition of doing. And um in this Uh, who's this kid who wrote this? Patrick Kaiger? Yeah, I hadn't either, but he's pretty good. Yeah, he does say that it goes back to Columbus, it goes well back before that. Um. The Portuguese in particular love to enslave Africans, and actually African tribes used to enslave one another. They had a completely different method and system of slavery. Uh. Slaves were treated much better among African tribes, especially West African tribes, um so where they would eat at the same table as the people that own them. And of course the Romans use slaves. The jew spent a good portion of their history as slaves of the Egyptians. So I mean whenever we come upon new people or subjugate them, we we have a history of enslaving them. Like, yeah, we tend to conquer. Like Chris Columbus met the very friendly Arowack people and instead of saying, well, we can learn from them, he thought they would make really good servants, right, how hard working they are and they don't even speak English, so who cares, right, exactly? Well. They were also looked upon as savages are less than human, which definitely aided the subjugation of their their I don't know, blood right, Do you know why? Why? Because back before everything was discovered and there was still a lot of undiscovered land and they were making maps, the map makers would often chart these undiscovered lands as being filled with you know, mutant human beings and scary beasts for some reason, like here there be monsters because we haven't gotten around the mapping this area yet, so just assume that there's some sort of water serpent that's going to eat your boat. Yeah, I guess I don't know why. They tended to strike fear into people into explorers instead of saying there might be very friendly people. Maybe caution fear of the unknown. You think so, But Josh, these days, virtually every corner of the Earth has been explored, except for obviously parts of Antarctica and map which I had never heard of, you, whereas in Brazil, and they said that this territory in northern Brazil is still unexplored forest, right, so it's possible there are undiscovered people out there maybe, right, If there are undiscovered people out there, they are in big trouble because if the uncontacted or isolated people are any indication in their polite um, then yeah, any undiscovered people are really kind of screwed. Um. You know, we talked about Chris Columbus and subjugating people and actually, uh, Columbus is quite the little genocidal maniac was. We covered that in one of the other podcasts we did. We did um because not only did he enslave them, he killed them, had them killed like the entire groups of people are assumed to have been wiped out by European colonization, and not just through brute force, but this, uh, this type of genocide, and especially if you look at a genocide as the the by its definition that it's the systematic wiping out of a group, right like a people or a population, then it's still continues today as recently as the the eighties the nineties in Brazil are you talking about the microbes or are you talking about outright violence, violence specifically against the akun Zoo. Yes, Josh, the akun Zoo who seemed like a friendly tribe that grew corn and hunted and remote Brazil for thousands of years until they were discovered and it was discovered that their land could be used for soy cultivation and cattle right so uh and log actually right, So the companies put in logging roads and into these this virgin territory where the accun Zoo lived, and they actually came upon them. And it's part of Brazil's constitution that, um, the moment you meet an uncontacted tribes person or an undiscovered person, all work stops. So with the logging companies and the soybean farming concerns and the cattle ranchers did was higher assassins like death squads. When they did meet the accun Zoo uh and sent them in and actually masacred them with guns. These people used bows and arrows, and these guys came in with machine guns and killed all but seven of the entire tribe. Then they fled, sadly they fled, and into just last year, a newspaper reported that there were only five living a kun zoo in the world and that was that wasn't you know, very shameful. Yeah, but they are not Josh the most isolated tribe according to Survival International, aren't they know? That would be the Sentinel Ees. Have you ever heard of these guys? Now? I hadn't and I saw that video you sent me. There's a clip on you tube. Yeah, I think what did you just search the centinnalies and it came up there was a couple of eclips, I think nat g. I went down there and they did the same thing. They came out of the jungle onto the beach and what it looked like in the video, or that is their interpretation, was they were making friendly gestures. Um. I did see another one where they had the bow and arrow out and um I was laughing that. When I was watching it earlier, part of me expected like hippie Rob to come out as their leader. Yeah, he's like the God, He's like Brando and Apocalypse now exactly. Um and the Sentinel needs Josh where they They are believed to be descended from the very first humans in Africa, and technically we all are, but These people are directly descended from the first group that migrated out about sixty thousand years ago. Right. They live on the and Aman Islands, Indian Ocean. And did you notice how clear that water was and how white those beaches were. I wouldn't leave either, dude, it was gorgeous. Needs TV and Xbox when you've got that, you know, Right, So these people will come out of the jungle if you throw coconuts into the water at the beach. That's what they were doing, right, what was it. Yeah, these this group of people were sitting there throwing coconuts into the water, and the uh sentinels came out and we're like, thanks for the coconuts. Well, they probably thought it's raining coconuts from the giant monster. But they are actually not primitive Stone age folks from what they say. Survival International says they're actually do make tools and weapons from recovered metal from shipwrecks. Right, pretty cool. They are actually not threatened. They're very isolated and relatively uncontacted. Um, but they're not threatened. They live on an island that no one really has any interest in, right exactly. But as we saw with the a Kunzo though, UM if there is money to be made off of the indigenous land, you're you're in trouble. Soy oil, Yeah, Cattle Survival International actually named all of those oil um farming, cattle and logging UH as the the dominant threat to uncontacted tribes. There's supposedly an estimated hundred uncontacted tribes in the world. Yeah, I was kind of surprised. That's a lot. And it's sad that these people are around for sixty thou years doing their thing, doing their thing long before us, and we just come in and say, hey, this would make a great soy farm. So I'm going to massacre you. Then about the bail out and they're like, we're staying here, not for us now. So UM, there's five regions that are under the greatest threat right now and they're in Brazil, Paraguay, and Peru. And actually there's tons of evidence there's groups dedicated like Rival International UM and other n g o s. And then there's actually government ministries set up in Brazil and in Peru and I think Paraguay UM that are in charge of keeping track of these uncontacted tribes, which is really difficult to do UH. And a lot of times. These uncontacted tribes are slivers offshoots of other tribes that have had their land disturbed by logging or um mining oil companies. So they would join up with another tribe and you know, they just take off into the forest. No one would know how many there were, that kind of thing, but yeah, they would be living primitively, but they're getting pushed further and further out or being massacred, or they're coming into contact with disease. Right, Yeah, that's what I'm talking about with the microbes. Violence is obviously a big threat, but they say that a bigger threat are uh, these people that these tribes that lack communities to these awful diseases that twentieth century man has twenty century man, excuse me, sure it's the future. Yeah, uh yeah, there's actually uh that favorite book of mine in four Charles C. Man talks about how there's an estimated hundred million people living on in the America's uh in four and then I think nine were wiped out by smallpox, thank you, like within a few decades. And Josh, it didn't just happen way back then, like you said. In the eighties, the some Christian missionaries made contact with the Zoe tribe in Brazil, and in pretty short form, forty five members of that tribe died from the flu, malaria, and respiratory diseases. Just like that. And uh, more recently, in nine half of the Maroon whoa maroona whoa tribe I think in Brazil. Uh, they were contacted by illegal loggers and half of the tribe was wiped out, um from respiratory illnesses. I think. So it's not like to bring up one of our favorite movies again. It's not like bringing orange soda to the Waponi Woo. Joe versus the Volcano. Oh yeah, it's not like that in real life. I thought you were talking about, Um, the gods must be crazy. Not another good one though. But it's not like the Joe Versus Volcano. It's not all happy, go lucky. They usually make contact with them. And even in the case of the Christian missionaries who were trying to do good I guess, and ended up killing a lot of them, and the Brazilian government stepped in and actually kicked them out the religious group and said now you gotta get out of here. Yeah. And apparently even when the thing is when contact is made as safely as possible and there's a medical contingency plan in place. Uh, it's expected that a lot of the tribes people will die. But if there's if it's if they're made through illegal loggers or a Christian missionary group that doesn't know what they're doing, then uh, yeah, a lot of people die. If not the entire group. Right, That tribe did recover, though, we should note, yeah, which is good news to get out of here Christian missionary so we can live peacefully and helpfully. So Chuck, is it good to even contact these people? Well, it can be good and bad because obviously if you make contact and you know a little bit about their way of life, you can protect them. But it's also, like this newspaper article, it also opens them up to a being invaded or watched or in this case, what what was the the tourism trip? Tell him about that that's awful savage tourism. Yeah. Actually, the guy who um was responsible for leading the expedition that produced those photographs that made the paper in two thousand and eight was apparently approached by travel agents who wanted him to set up a savage tourism trip, which can't you just see a bunch of like fat white Germans and Americans Like who I want to touch you right now? Your whole tribes wiped out And now let's get back on the cruise ship and look at the ice sculpture. Like like I said, Um, the Brazil has it in has mentioned uncontacted and undiscovered people in its constitution in large part because of that unexplored forests in that just that one territory. They have a real You don't have that in America, Like we don't have to worry about, you know, how to treat undiscovered tribes. We figured out how to treat the ones we're familiar with badly enough, right, Um. But so Brazil apparently recognizes that like, hey, this is your land, right and you legally own it. If you're an uncontacted or isolated tribe, nobody can touch it, but then has a really terrible history of following through on stopping people from going in logging in oil. Peru's history is even worse. They have some uncontacted tribes and threatened uncontacted tribes and Peru's president is like, I'm not even sure they exist. And by the way, the French oil company that's working in this area where they supposedly exist. I've now just decreed that their work is a national nessas city. So when you when you're an uncontacted tribe and you're butting heads with an oil company, you're gonna lose. Yeah, I would say so, but I will say Paraguay, hats off to Paraguay because they actually the environmental nice Chuck just took his head off to the environmental ministry revoked the license of a ranching concern that was just decimating and I don't mean in the literal like removing ten percent term, right, I mean like decimating all you Latin speakers out there, the um the this land that technically belongs to the indigenous uncontacted tribes there. So so they booted them out or they just took away their permits. They took away their permits, which is pretty much tantamount to booting them out. Awesome. Yeah, it's just so sad that when you know, such a modernist point of view to see these undiscovered or uncontacted people and think that their savages and that their way of life is is savage and primitive. It's just they were here first. Well, I mean we were, we were, we were all here first, we were all here at the same time. But it's just a complete lack of recognition of other people's choices. Yeah, and in respect for other other cultures in ways of life, and because again didn't fly around here. There's no grand theft auto in the jungle. No, there's not. No, there's no auto. If you want to learn more about people undiscovered or otherwise, you should try typing in people in the Andy serge bar How stuff works dot com. It brings up a hidden sub channel. Really yes, uh and uh, I guess since I said hidden subchannel, that means it's time for what Chuck listener mail, Yes, Josh, it is. And before we do that, we want to send a thank you to Dan of the pottery Dan Dan made, Dan made. He has a little uh etsy website, Dan made dot et s y dot com and he makes pottery. And he sent us some really awesome coffee mugs. Yes, Dan made very cool mugs. And actually it's my my work mug. Now that's what do he is? I noticed cool detail. You've got an octopus on yours with a pipe smoking a pipe. I can't tell what mine is. It's some little dude. But it's just got cool details, got swirls in the bottom, little intentions, and only some parts of it are glazed and others raw. It's Dan, Maide knows what he's doing. So thanks Dan, and you know what, you want to bring up people who have been sending us little gifts, and it's just really nice to come into work and have someone you know, Uh what was her name that sent us the Twinkie the homemade Twinkie the Kid shirts. I don't remember her name. She's like Kaya or something like Kyla. I believe she should write in because I told her that I would mention her little website too. Okay, yeah, yeah, we got Twinky the Kid t shirts because remember we talked about how badly we wanted something. So with that listener, ma'am all right, I'm gonna call this, uh organ donation details from someone who knows. Uh. Hi, Josh and Chuckers and Jerry. I'm an anesthesiologist who specializes an organ transplantation, specifically livers and kidneys. In fact, we performed a liver transplant just last night and I'm home resting after what is always an exhausting procedure. Ah, he thought we might want a few more details about organ donations. So he says this um they do not get to meet the donor and the recipient until after a period of time, usually a year, and only after both agreed to meet. But we also had people that wrote in and said they met like weeks later, So it might vary by hospital or state. Yeah, I'm not sure, or maybe there's just an agreement you go into. But he says, they can trade letters and get very basic, unidentifiable information about each other, but it all gets censored by the organ procurement organization. This is because of this recipient does not live or the organ fails, the recipient or donor won't blame the donor or in their families. Also, if the organ works, they don't want the parties involved feeling unduly indebted to the donor. After all, it's supposed to be a free gift with no strings attached. After they have both had time to adjust to their new lives and agreed and prepared to meet, they can meet. That being said, people can still find each other if they are looking in turn to the same websites specifically designed to link donor to recipient. Although it is strongly discouraged, So maybe that was the deal. They did it in serpticism. So I thought somebody came up at the website and make money off of people who want to meet the people who donated a kidney to them. What a great world we live in. I thought your listeners would want to know this, and I hope it encourages would be donors that they don't have to meet the recipient if they think it would be too difficult with guards. Todd. Thanks Todd the anesthesiologist. Yeah, and didn't he say that it's uh like you. You die very easily if you're over anesthetized during a liver Yeah, he's a ps here. If you want to know why an anesty caesiologist would need to specialize in liver transplantation, ask yourself if you would like to wake up during a procedure where patients don't tolerate anesthetics very well, and if you would like your new liver to have something to cleanse. He says, very mysterious. Stud I just asked myself that, and I have no answer. I don't need So if you bring people to the drink of death and you want to tell us about it, or if you make money off of genuine human kindness. We want to hear your ploy.
