Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from how Stuff Works dot Com. Everybody loves altoy. It's little ments that come intense. Well, once the ments are gone, you can do some really neat things with the left over tense. People have made empty three players, cameras, even stoves. Check out how stuff Works dot com slash tent evators to find out more. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. It's stuff you should Know with Josh Clark that's me and Charles W. Bryant that's you, right, And this is really stuff you should know. Yeah, not like the usual gobbledegook that we just toss out there. This is this is an important one. Sure, I think so too. We're talking about what the CDC classifies in the top ten accomplishments of public health of the twentieth century. Indeed, and also might be one of the most the faririest pots that are perpetrated on the global public good stuff. Let's do it. Let's do it, Chuck. We're talking about fluoride, the seemingly innocuous stuff that is added to our water supply and our toothpaste, and our pills, diet pills, mouthwash, what else, um, soft drinks, Well, that stuff that we ingest. It's also in rat poison and things like that. Antipsychotic medications, paint are not pain killers, tranquilizers. Yeah, it's all over the place. And actually it is exceedingly difficult to get rid of or to get away from, anything that has water in it. Uh, say, a soft drink is going to have fluoride in it too, because pretty much all of our water has fluoride in it, at least here in the States of American cities fluoridate their own water flooridate water that already has naturally occurring fluoride in it, which is hinky. It is hinky. Let's let's talk about fluoride first, right back in the nineteen forties here in the States. We should also say, around the world, this is not necessarily the case. There are some countries that absolutely don't floridate water. Some used to. Yeah, Denmark and Switzerland are among those that used to and don't anymore. France never did. But in the States we've been hot and heavy about floridating water for a long time since when Grand Rapids Michigan became the first um city to floridate, to add fluoride to it's already fluoridated water. Uh. And Grand Rapids became the kind of model city for this. It was studied extensively. Uh. And the whole reason we started floridating water is and as Chuck likes to say, I find the shinky. Uh. Scientists discovered that areas where naturally occurring fluoridated water was being drunk by the citizens. UM. They also there was also a correlation with a decline and dental carries all about the teeth. Dental carries are any kind of signs of decay, like a cavity or something like that. It's an umbrella term form. Right. So they decided, hey, we should add floride to the water and put it in toothpaste, and uh, we'll we'll get our teeth in shape here in this country. And since then, everybody's fine with fluoride. It's totally cool. You know, if you'll remember, toothpaste used to be touted with with fluoride. It's actually a little more difficult to find that little label these days. Right. The ad A American Dental Association says it's great the organization. They came out in nineteen sixty nine and said it's good stuff. Big, big organizations are behind it. And uh, there actually has been a major decline in tooth decay since then. Back in the forties, the early forties, I believe in the US, the average kid had fifteen dental carries. Right, that's a lot. That a lot, I mean, that makes me look good. Do you have a lot of cavities or a lot of fillings? I'm like a crackhead over here. Yeah, my my. I remember when I was a kid and I kept getting fillings every time. I rather sardonic, Lee told my dentist one time, why don't you just go ahead and fill them all? Right now? Just get it over with. You were sardonic way back then, said I keep coming back in here, and you do a couple every time, So once you just go ahead and do them all. And he said, well, that's no kind of attitude, really, right, And I went yeah, And all of a sudden, you forgot what you were talking about exactly. Yeah. So UM again Floride endorsed across the board almost by almost every major UM dental association, public Health Association, the c d C, as we said, the World Health Organization, and they all point to studies that show that floride is perfectly fine even though it's an insecticides and rat poisons and tranquilizers. Right. Um, The problem is there are also plenty of studies that have surfaced or been conducted over the years that show fluoride is not necessarily fine. Now are we gonna get into the dark side? Now? Is it time? I don't see any reason to hold off any longer. I mean, what have we we talked about? How you know there's been a decrease in dental carries since fluoride was introduced or right? The thing is, the impression I have is everybody seems to be okay with adding fluoride to toothpaste, But it's the water supply that really gets people's ire up, right, right, I think, because it's already in there, not just that. And also we should say that the optimal, as far as the e p A Is concerned, the optimal amount of fluoride added to drinking water is four parts per million, right, yes, indeed, and and anything over that up to fourteen parts per million is considered dangerous. Right And way back in nineteen any to the National Academy of Sciences estimated that more than two hundred thousand people in the US we're drinking water with fluoride levels above four parts per million. And what are some of the dangers. Well, some of the dangers are discoloration and corrosion of your teeth, which is called dental fluorosis. Yeah, which is ironic that it's something. The whole point of fluoride is to prevent dental decay, and over exposure or prolonged exposures, say, oh, I don't know, over the course of a lifetime. Um, it can actually degrade your teeth's health. It can actually accelerate decay, and not just teeth but bones as well, which is skeletal fluorosis. It can also cause seizures. It can also cause a severe gastro intestinal upset, can lower your i Q supposedly allegedly, well that's not necessarily allegedly. There's a bunch of studies, um that have been shown that there is at least a correlation between high fluoride exposure and low i Q. Right, China is big on that. Actually, there's been a slew of studies to come out of China that show that UM and the Chinese have also conducted other studies outside of China, so it's not just China that's got heavily fluoridated dummies, you know. Um, So Chuck, I guess now, let's let's pull the trigger. Let's get into the whole conspiracy aspect of this. Yes, there's something called the florid conspiracy, which we've found quite disturbing. We did speak for you, Yeah, please do. And Um, should we go back to and kind of set up how this happened. Yes, let's go back in time, Josh, like we'd love to do to. So are years from the release of Ghostbusters. Uh. The I. G. Farben Company in Germany, they're a chemical manufacturing company. They started getting loans from banks here in America. So what that led to was Henry Ford and American Standard Oil merged with I. G. Farban and in the early thirties, all of a sudden there were more than a hundred corporations who had cooperatives and subsidiaries in Germany. So, all of a sudden, we have a lot of a lot of manufacturing and business going on in Germany. Early thirties. Flash forward a little bit to thirty nine, under the Altet agreement, and the American Aluminum Company, which is the largest producer of sodium fluoride, and Dow everyone knows about doll the chemical company. They transfer technology to Germany as well. So all of a sudden you have what's known as the fluoride mafia quote unquote, because that was the largest producer of sodium fluoride in the world at the time, right, right, And I guess we should say that here's the deal. Fluoride is a byproduct of a lot of manufacturing processes. Hydrofluoria solicic acid is exactly. Um. We should also say at this point that the studies that are conducted on the dangers of fluoride, which no one disputes, you can, there is such a thing as fluoride toxicity. That's fact. Sin dispute is number one, whether or not it will actually affect intelligence, and number two, whether the risks of Florida toxas city outweigh the benefits to dental health. Right, okay, right, right, okay, So go ahead, Chuck. So now, uh flash forward a little bit more into World War two. Uh, the U. S. Government sends a guy named Charles Elliott Perkins and he's a research a chemistry guy. Uh. They sent him to Germany to work with the chemical plants over there with the I. G. Farban Co Company, and a German chemissaire told him of a scheme which was devised that the German chemists were going to know they had been they had been giving floride to prisoners of wars. That right, they were fluoridating, heavily fluoridating from from how I take it, at the water at the pow camps in Germany to quote, make them stupid and docile. Yes, interesting, very interesting. So apparently that that caught the attention of the Americans. It did. Indeed. Nine Gerald Cox, who was a chemist employed by the Aluminum company, Yeah, concludes in a study with lab rats that floride reduces the cavities, dental cavities. And this is where everything just kind of picks up from there, like all of a sudden, fluoride is associated with the reduction in dental caries, and now we need to just start adding it to our drinking water, right right. Seven Oscar Ewing, who was a longtime attorney for the Aluminum company, is appointed head of the Federal Security Agency, which places him in charge of the public Health Service, and over the next three years after that, seven American city started floridating their water. Right. And this is just an early example of the revolving door. You know about the revolving door, right, we've talked about it before school me Um. It's like, uh, Paulson, yeah, yeah, yeah. Paulson when he was head of the Treasury, he was a Goldman Sacksman, and of course kush Kari he was a Goldman Sacksman too. It's just it's the revolving door. Is basically this this um interaction, this interplay between the private sector and public office. So the private sector will send some of their top people to serve in public office, affect policy change that helps this private sector, and then they come out and get huge bonuses in a Kush job. Exactly. This is exactly what you're talking about now with Oscar ewing in right. We need to keep saying that word. So basically, Josh, the eliminum manufacturing and fertilizer and weapons industries start conducting this education and research for fluoride, saying how great it is when it's one of their biggest byproducts, and apparently the deal is it's very expensive byproduct to get rid of it is, but it's also toxic waste. So very conveniently, they have all these studies that come out and say, hey, it's really good for you and by these companies, and we just happen to have a bunch. So let's start selling it to municipalities to put into their water supply. Right, should we talk about Eddie Burne's Edward Burne's Real Quick? Yeah? I and actually, Chuck, we had we had a suggestion from one of our listeners a while back, UM when we talked about I think it was the Propaganda episode, Um, and he sent in some stuff about Edward Burney's. I think Edward Burnet's actually deserves his own podcast. This guy created PR and like the kind of thank you for smoking PR the original spin doctor, I'd like to I think we should do one on him. I agree. So Barney's is um funded by these industrialists to try and encourage this PR campaign that it's good for you. You're gonna read the quote alright. So Berne's is quoted as saying you can get practically any idea accepted if doctors are in favor. The public is willing to accept it because the doctor is an authority to most people, regardless of how much he knows or doesn't know how about that, which is true. Uh. And actually, Chuck, I should say, um, you know my cute little girlfriend, she's sharp as attack. Uh. She and I were watching something about a like an elliptical machine or something. It was an infomercial for it, and they had this doctor on and he was touting the the health benefits of this machine. But it said his name and then new York cardiologist, and it just completely went over my head. And she she stopped him, was like, what is the fact that he's a New York cardiologist had to do with anything? And I realized, like, New York cardiologist had just buzzed into my brain and it was an infomercial. So I took the guy with a grain of salt to begin with. But I did not notice at all that it was a New York cardiologist I was listening to. But I'm sure that that still had an effect the legitimacy that this guy had. In my opinion, if it would have said de Moine pediatrician, you probably wouldn't have Pian Detroit even work for eau Claire was Canton was Canton. So, uh, basically, these doctors weren't necessarily bad guys and ladies, but they never really got these studies. A lot of these studies were allegedly suppressed, and people that oppose it were, you know, called cranks and quacks, and so all these doctors are seeing these cooked studies, essentially cooking the books. Nice Chuck, allegedly get him Chuck recently declassified documents about the Manhattan Project Josh, where we made the atomic bomb, found out that floride is a key chemical ingredient in the atomic bomb. Even worse than that, though, there was a an A. D. A. M. Study that apparently said that floride does pose a health risk, and the Atomic Energy Agency actually redacted much of this study. So when the American Dental Association is being redacted by the Atomic Energy Agency, that's that should raise some sort of flag, you know. The reason they gave though? What national security? Yeah, and apparently, Chuck, when whenever the government pulls out national security, including lawsuits which are arch nemesis. Ira Glass recently covered in a This American Life story on the origins of things. Um, there's absolutely nothing you can do, like that's that's it. The judges says, well, this case can't be tried. Well, you know what else happened in two thousand three? The Water Act. Yeah, the Water Act was passed. And one of the little things in the Water Act that you may not know about people, is that it made it impossible for water companies to undergo civil or criminal hearings as a result of adding fluoride to public water. So they basically said, you can't see him because we passed the Water Act. So if someone finds out something awful, there's nothing you can do about it to make money. So again we should go back and say that if you ask the c d C, the A d AH, the World Health Organization, if you ask any of these agents the's is Florida dangerous? They will conclusively say no. Or we should say it, does Florida give you cancer? They will say no. Of course, there are plenty of studies out there that link floride cancer. Again, though these studies appear to be repressed. Have you heard of Philos Melanax. Yeah, let's talk about her. She was what a Harvard researcher, Yeah, toxicologists. She was a New York cardiologist in the Yeah, and um, she was about to publish a study um on the link between cancer and floride. Was that right? Well, yeah, she she thought that it might lead to lower i Q and and a couple of Yeah, because some uh during her studies of rodents, they were displaying um symptoms and signs of a d h D. Uh. And we'd also are already long known that fluoride exposure causes um osteo sarcomas, which is bone cancer in rats. Um. But she okay, So she was doing the link between a d h D, lower i Q and fluoride and she was fired a couple of days before her UM findings were published. So she goes to the National Institutes of Health for research grant to continuous studies, and they said floride does not lower i Q, it does not affect intelligence and turned her down and said sorry, we have no money for you. And National Institutes of Health they're not supposed to write the conclusions for researchers before their studies are published. And you know what she was fired from. What her job was. She was ahead of toxicology at the Forsyth Dental Center in Boston. Yeah. Interesting, the plot is getting so thick. I can barely put my hand in it. It is. This is honestly, I'd never heard of this. And Ben Bowling, they did UH on the soon to be released stuff they don't want you to know a video podcast. They did one on floride, so we kind of borrowed from them. Well, we actually asked Ben the Godfather for his blessing and he very generously gave it to us. Right. Um, so chuck the here's the biggest one to me. This is this is the one that gets me the most. Okay. So, the studies that show that fluoride poses little to no health risk if it's delivered at four parts per million or less in fluoridated water UM Number one or about twenty years old, UH and number two were conducted using pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride. This is the stuff that actually is in toothpaste, really high grade stuff. Um. And that's why no one really has any problem with fluoride and toothpaste. It's the fluoride in the drinking water supply. As we said earlier, the people are worried about. One of the reasons why is that while some cities do put sodium fluoride in their water supply. It's still not pharmaceutical grade, and even worse, a lot of cities use hydrofluora solicic acid, which, Chuck, you mentioned that it's a byproduct of fertilizer production, UM munitions production, UM aluminum production, scrubbed from the smoke stacks. Say it again, Chuck, scrubbed from the inside of smoke stacks of fertilizer plants, fertilizer plants and put into our water, put into truck, shipped to water um treatment plants where it sold the cities and inserted into the water supply. Dude, I'm not Mr. Conspiracy guy. I kind of its interests me, but this is one of those where I was I was blown away. Well, I think the gray irony of this podcast is that the um aluminum foil hats were wearing were actually produced by ALCA. I mean, come on, how's that for full circle? Yeah, but we're not getting any it's bouncing off all the radio electric or radiomagnetic electromagnetic waves. What am I saying? Do you? I know what you're saying, buddy. So that's um, that's florid. Actually that's kind of just the tip of the iceberg. Really, one thing that I took hard in is that, Um, it seems like more and more legitimate groups are undertaking studies or reevaluations of some of the studies that were conduct did on whether or not fluoride poses a health risk starting in the twenty one century. UM. And it looks like people are starting to take a slightly more scrutinizing view of it because they were Burns is long dead, and so are all of the revolving door people who got this whole thing started. So we'll see, right. The e p A is one of them. Actually, thank god I saw one of their scientists in their union chapter two eighty it is taking a big stand against it, Dr William Hersey, And he's the vice president of that chapter of the e p A. And he says that quote fluoride is a hazardous waste product for which there is substantial evidence of adverse health effects and contrary to public perception, virtually no evidence of significant benefits. Boom right. And when a scientist union starts talking, it's bad because you've got eggheads and leg breaking um teamsters rolled into one. You don't want to mess with that. A teams NERD combo is deadly and actually, if you're looking for a legitimate source, a legitimate voice of opposition to fluoridating water, should check out anything Dr Hardy Lineback has written. He's an associate professor of dentistry and the head of the preventative he's the head of preventative Dentistry at the University of Toronto. He's a vocal opponent of floridating water, and he's got some great points. Yea Hardy Lineback, crime back, cool stuff. Josh, Yeah, that's that's it. We should probably, uh, we'll have to find another conspiracy one to do, because our conspiracy ones really get people going. People love that c I and LSD fake moon landing. Actually mk ultra was used in some of these experiments that was part of the under the mk ultra umbrella. This floor ideal. Well, there's like two hundred forty nine or a hundred and forty nine programs under mk ultra. So he's gonna get to floride sooner or later, especially if the Nazis are saying, dude, it totally makes your popular anatians docile. Yeah, and they're like you should try LSD. Yeah. There was a big exchange was just wow, pretty cool? Is it? Time four listener mail? All right, Josh, I'm gonna call this I've got a couple here. I'm gonna call it an answer to our query that we posed, which one when we asked what the woman who had the lightning go through a kitchen and we actually asked yea Paloma. So, Josh, if you remember, Paloma wrote in and said that she had this lightning travel through her kitchen and allowed buzzing popping sound and put it right in front of her face and passed from one wall to another, absolutely but left her totally unharmed, totally unharmed, and it didn't even leave a mark on any of the walls that it passed through. It did not. And there was no thunder in the area afterward, right or there was, but it was far away, Okay, no loud clap of thunder. So this one is actually we had a few people right in. But this is from Tyler. He's a grad student at the Department of Chemical Engineering in Material Science at the University of Minnesota, class of oh He's a youngster, he is. He says, uh, I nearly lost it when I heard your quandary. Today. I've been listening to you guys for months and never felt had anything truly worthy to add. But now I'm thrilled. My older sister had gotten a series of time Life books, remember those containing a plethora of odd and amazing stories. I think, yeah, yeah, Well I had the Old West series that was the best. One shot a man for storing too loud um. When she moved, I took up the collection and let them gather dust. However, I recently started reading them, and uh, they're both entertaining and revealing. The story you read on the air sounds very close to ball lightning. The only major difference is that the writer didn't mention any damage to your house, and most ball lightning stories, UH do note some some damage. So I'm not a hundred percent sure, but it sounds like ball lightning. So we got that from Tyler, and we also got that from Kent and Elgin Illinois, Brian and Montana who Sarah of unknown origins Kelsey and a story in New York and Finn again also said that, and he also requested that I do my cheek thing and say Ponzi. But fin again, Josh and I are not dancing monkeys to perform trips for you. It's a bun sre. You're so easy. I am so easy. Yeah, so thanks to all of you for writing that in. I have to say, as far as I know, Ball Lightnings existence has never been conclusively proven. But again, you know me, that doesn't doesn't necessarily mean anything, Josh soft encounter Clark, Yeah, soft encounter with fact. Does that make sense? Yeah? All right, Well, if you want to send us anything, um whatever, send us something. We're not going to call for anything because every time we do, we get a bunch of stuff. I want a bunch of different stuff. Whatever people want to do. And Chuck, didn't you want to issue a command for this stuff? You should know nation? Oh, I did you know? It's prusing iTunes? And I was looking at some of our reviews, which some are very kind, some aren't so kind, some people don't like fine, whatever, But we only had like seven comments, and I saw that Adam Carolla's podcast had like five thousand. I should say at this point, Chuck flew into a rage. He broke chairs, he uh finished off a fifth of whiskey, and he groped anything in sight, including me. It was ugly. It was ugly, So I just thought i'd say, hey, guys, go to iTunes if you will at some point and leave a comment and review in the Stuff you Should Know section. It doesn't have to be great. If you don't like it, then you can say that too. But I just want to get the count up a little higher. So that is my call. We have a lot of listeners and not many of them have responded yet, so let's hear it. It's such a clear abuse of power. Please disgusting, pretty please? All right, So if you want to send us an email about anything at all, remember anything at all, you can send that to stuff podcast how stuff works dot com.
