Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant right there, there's Jerry over there, and well, well you guys are feeling fine. I'm a little under the weather, but it's still stuff you should know, the two thousand nineteen Flu edition, that's right. And this is dangerously close to published date for us. Yeah, a little a little close for comfort if you ask me. But you know what, this gives us the opportunity to do real time stuff. Yeah, like say Seattle, Portland in San Francisco. Yeah, we're gonna be in your town next week. Uh the week, No, you're right, dude, next week when this comes out. Yeah, so uh more Theater on January, uh in Seattle, Revolution Hall in Portland on je X, and then our annual Sketch Fest show at the Castro on January. Tickets are moving kind of slow, guys, And I think there's been, uh, there's been people writing in saying they didn't even know that you were coming. Yeah, so, uh, I don't know what the problem is. We're coming, We're coming. Yeah, We're still troubleshooting what the deal was, what, because we don't ever want to happen again. But um, I just feel good knowing that everybody's not mad at us out in the Pacific Northwest. Well, I hope not. I would hope not too, but it was kind of luck in that way for a second. We think it might be something to do with our promos, who knows, so we wanted to put it in this episode, right, like in the body of the episode, like you can't miss it. So now you know, go to s y s K live dot com and there will be links out to go get tickets, info all that stuff, and we'll see you guys next week. So hurry, hurry, hurry, go get your tickets. We'll see you next week next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, right, and I will be feeling better by then, I'm hoping, ye. So, um, the chuck is kind of appropriate that we're talking about the flu, because I don't have the flu, but I'm a little sick, a little funky. Um, I'm not contagious, so don't worry. Well, I appreciate you wearing the face mask anyway, which it turns out, according to this uh this article that ed wrote, um it, Uh, it's yeah, useless. It doesn't do anything. Yeah, I don't. I don't know if that's truly useless, is it? Yes? I think it is actually quite useless. Um. If it's a bacterial infection, it might do something because bacteria is much larger than viruses. But viruses are very very small, certainly small enough to be expelled through the mash of a gauze when you cougher sneeze into it, sneeze and that mask puffs out and little particles spew. Maybe just not as far. Yeah, yeah, they might be slowed down a little bit. Who knows, maybe like being pushed through like a little channel beats them up and increases their tragic Oh my god, we don't know yet. Uh. Yeah, but this is a flu centric episode, and I can't remember. I think I was turned onto this idea. You were turned on by this idea to this idea? Um, I think it was when I was sort of going down a World War One rabbit hole. Oh yeah, you were talking about that in some episode. I think that was what it was. So this is pretty appropriate that we're talking about this because exactly a hundred years ago today, basically the United States. The world really was standing there, stricken, picking up the pieces of basically shattered societies all around the globe that has just been leveled, absolutely leveled by a flu epidemic that came through and killed so many people, made so many people sick. It's widely seen as possibly tied for for if not, it's a very close second to the worst natural disaster and the worst pandemic to ever hit human kind in the history of our species. Yeah, that's how bad it was, and it happened just a hundred years ago. Yeah. I've seen estimates as high as fifty million people dead. Yeah, I've seen I've seen it up to a hundred million. I think fifty million. Is it used to be like the low end and now or the high end? And now it's starting to become clear it's probably about the low end. I think the low end is twenty Oh is that right? Uh? And I'm gonna name the high end. Five million people. That's supposedly from what I've seen, how many were actually infected? Oh? Well possibly, And not only that, like, when that many people die, it changes the course of world history. Yeah, it changes it. Basically, it unravels the fabric of society as we'll see sociding cultures and rules and uh, just how humans looked at the earth. It like it it really turned the forward march of humanity in a certain direction. It definitely did. And like this, it's really difficult. Like this is one of the most fascinating pieces of of world history to me because it was like it's it was. It's pretty well documented because it happened only a hundred years ago, and because it's just so insane what happened, Like the Spanish flu was so bad chuck that um people were dying of thirst because there was no one around them to take care of them. The people who were still healthy were so afraid of catching the flu they would basically let their neighbors die alone in their homes rather than go help them and take care of them and give them water. Like that's that's how bad it was. Like people were dying of thirst from being so laid up by the flu and not being able to get water themselves and not having anyone to take care of them. And it happened in the United States hundred years ago and all over the world. And despite all of this horrific thing, Uh, we're about to talk about the Grabster started his article writing about hockey as he is from Buffalo, and then later on he's like, it's the third wave that that canceled the NHL playoffs. Yeah, I mean it is a footnote though. The Stanley Cup, the very famous Stanley Cup, the trophy of the NHL uh that has all the winning teams etched into it says series not completed. That's all it says. And unless you know what's going on, you might just scratch your head and say, why was the series not completed that year? And the reason is because the Spanish flu literally killed one of the players and got quite a few of them sick on both sides of the Seattle Metropolitans. In the Montreal Canadiens, yeah, I guess, like right before the fifth game was going to be played, um or the sixth game was going to be played, they like four of them were in the hospital. One died, and they're like, yeah, we'll just go ahead and canceled the series this year. But what's what is crazy is like, that's pretty bad because think about it, you're a hockey player, you're probably young, you're probably pretty healthy. That's really weird to die from the flu. Uh, and that was a big hallmark of the Spanish flu as we'll see. But this was also like a third wave. This is the third like roundhouse that the Spanish fluid delivered to the global population when the when the Stanley Cup was canceled or the the NHL Playoffs was canceled that year in amazing. So let's talk a little bit about flues normally, shall we. Yeah, I mean, I think everyone understands that the flu is not bacterial like you were talking about. It is a virus, and ordinarily like the flu that you have, is that the flu you have are cold. It's just like a cold. It's just funk, you know what I mean? You me and I went to Vegas for her birthday, um, to go see Dave Chappelle and John Mayer, and I think just being on the plane and being kind of run down and everything, we we both kind of picked up a little bit funk. I think it's a tummy year. It's a funky kind of year. Emily gets sick every January. Yeah. I think it's also has to do with the holidays, uh, just because they're as fun and and unadulterated ly enjoyable as they are, they're also a taed stressful sometimes. Well yeah, and her that's her busy time of year for her business, so oh yeah, that's it's it's almost inevitable that she'll get sick every January, just like her body's fighting and fighting all through December and then just goes literally the day after Christmas. It's like sniff, yeah, he just crashed. Here it comes. Yeah. So the flu was a virus, and in most cases, like I was saying, you have the you know, you have your eggs and your fever and your coughing, and you're tired, and uh, sometimes it may be affect your stomach some sometimes it may not, but it's usually in and out in a few days, and that's sort of the end of it. Um. If you're like you mentioned, if you're elderly, or if you're a little little tiny one, uh, the flu can be pretty dangerous in any case, but ordinarily in healthy adults, is just a regular sickness that comes and goes. Yeah, especially like if you look at you know, a graph of ages starting at an infant all the way say two hundred year olds. If you if you look at flu deaths, it goes down in the middle and then goes back up. It's high on one end, high on the other end, very low to non existent in the middle, like healthy, like middle aged and younger adults don't die from the flu normally, right. Uh So, there are many types of flu. Uh, many strains of this virus. And in nineteen eighteen, for the Spanish flu, which we'll get to the naming of that in a second, it was type A subtype H one in one because they have subtype designations, and then within those subtypes there are other strains. Because the flu is constantly trying to outrun humans and humans trying to beat it down. Yeah, I guess so. So it's like I'm just gonna change a little Yeah, watch this, and it goes big boom boom boop, and now it's Bumblebee from Transformers exactly. Uh So, this was a genuine pandemic called the Spanish flu. And I never knew this at all, but it had really had nothing to do with being out of Spain or have anything to do with Spain other than the fact that Spain was neutral in World War two, I'm sorry, world War One, and while other newspapers around the world were really censoring things and not so free. Spain was just reporting. The only country really reporting about the flu. Yeah right, I didn't call the Spanish flu. I didn't realize this either. In the Spanish were like no, no, wait, wait, you guys aren't getting this. It's all just disproportionately on us. But it started in Kansas, it right. It seems like the um the that Spain had the worst of it because, like you said, they were the only ones who were openly reporting on it. And some of the Axis and Allied actually that might have been World War two, but some like France, Germany, Great Britain, the US, the governments were at war and their propaganda machines were in full swing. They didn't want to do anything to impact morale. They also didn't want to give the enemy any indication that their troops were sick, that there was a flu virus spreading through their their ranks, so they just downplayed it at home and everywhere. But since Spain was neutral, they talked about it. It It seemed like Spain had the worst of it. That's totally not the case. It's just it was all just reporting. Spain just reported on it openly. That's fascinating. To me. Yeah, totally fascinating, and uh, it was a legit pandemic because it touched UM kind of every corner of the globe, except for notably two places that were able to successfully quarantine themselves. What was that American Samoa, Yeah, in New Caledonia. Are those even places? They still are places thanks to those quarantines. Yeah, it could have wiped them out. Oh yeah, I think some places did get wiped out. I believe Western Samoa UM was basically wiped out by the Spanish flu. There were plenty of UM like settlements, especially Native American settlements in more remote places like Alaska, that were almost entirely if not entirely wiped out UM. And then you know if depending on where you went around the world, like Japan got hit, but they they had like a one percent infection rate or something like that, where other places had like like I think globally it was about thirty. So it was strange how it hit people differently. But it was definitely, like you said, it was a real pandemic in that it was everywhere around the world that this strain of the flu was leveling people. Yeah, and there's a couple of other kind of startling stats. That five million in fact that you were talking about not dead but infected. That was about a thirty three percent of the world's population, which is startling. And in the United States life expects you know how it talked about it just changing everything. Oh yeah, it actually altered life expectancy in the US by twelve years. Yeah, from nineteen eighteen and nineteen nineteen, they expected average expected or the life expectancy like you said, it went from it went to thirty six point six for men and forty two point two for women man, which is pretty like the the what it had been before was still pretty low, but to drop twelve years overnight, basically because I don't think we've gotten this across yet, Chuck. What we're talking about happened in less than a year. In less than a year, a third of the world's population came down with this very virulent flu and as much as five percent of the world's population died from that flu in less than a year. Yeah, and the we'll talk about the different waves, but the second deadliest wave really was about four months and and the amount of people that died within a four month period all over the world was just like it's hard to really grasp it really is. And the other thing about it too, is largely because of that propaganda machine, that was the propaganda machines that were in full operation in all those different countries, along with um kind of exuberance for the war being over or just basically being focused on the war. Because the Spanish flu happened at the same time World War One was going on and ending. Um, it wasn't. It's not remembered like you think it would be. Like you would think this would be like everyone would know about this and be talking about it, and it's not. It just kind of got swept under the rug historically speaking in a lot of ways. You want to take a break. Yeah, I think that was a uh wonderful, long winded setup. That's what we do. That's how we do things, alright, Chuck. So let's start at what maybe the beginning. There's this guy named John M. Barry, and he is a not Embury by the way, his meddle initials M, and his last name is Barry. Uh. He is an historian, and he wrote a book called The Great Influenza, and he wrote an article based on his research called how the Horrific en flew spread across America. It's on Smithsonian magazine. UM, and this guy's done some leg work and he has created a theory that's starting in about January of nineteen eighteen, the beginning of nineteen eighteen, uh, there was a flu outbreak in Haskell County, Kansas, which is a very rural agricultural area, and that some of those farm boys who came down with the same flu made their way to Camp Funston, which is part of Fort Riley, Kansas now Santa Fe in particular, was is the town if you want to even pinpointed further in Kansas, not New Mexico, Santa Fe, Haskell County, Kansas, three miles west of Camp Funston, YEP. So some of these farm boys who were sick with this flu ended up being drafted and sent to Camp Funston. And it was Camp Funston where they think the first cases of the Spanish flu started to break out. That first wave happened in about the spring and then traveling over to Europe into the summer of nineteen unique teen. And it wasn't that first wave wasn't particularly bad, It wasn't any particularly noteworthy, and it was mostly confined to um, two dough boys basically people who worked on on military basis as well. Um, and then maybe towns near military basis. But that was about it. And then it went away and it wasn't like had it just been that, it probably would not have been remarkable historically at all. Yeah, and you know this, we may not even know about any of this as far as its origin. And there have been a lot of other theories over the years about its origin, but this one seems to hold the most water now. But we may not have ever known anything about any of the origin if it had not been for Dr Loring Minor, who was a great for a small of a county in town as this was. He was a really great town doctor. Uh. And he was like at the time, flew just would come and go, like I said. So was never reported on in journals. It was never uh, it was never really a big deal. It was never published. But Dr Loring Minor was so alarmed at the rate of spread in his small town and the how much of a wallop that it packed. He actually published his concerns in a in a journal called the Public Health Reports journal has a different name today, but he was the only person in the world expressing concern. And I believe this is still the very first case of influenza being reported because of how like unusual and and deadly that they thought it could be. Yeah. I saw that too, that the very fact that this guy reported it at all is remarkable. Yeah. So they kind of trace it back and say, we we now think we know where ground zero was, Haskell County, Kansas. So from Haskell County, Kansas, it went to Camp fund Stone and then it went over to Europe. This is the first way that we're talking about. They hadn't changed their name because that used to be we put the fun in fun Stone, right, and then after that they were like, yeah, we gotta go to Fort Riley. So um, over in Europe, something happened to this, to this flu I mutated in some way, it did something. It mixed with some other flu maybe from Asia, maybe something that was present in Europe, who knows, but there you know, there was a flu outbreaks over there in um in Europe, particularly at one called a Topoa. I think I added a little extra mustard on that, but um, it's generally how you say it. It was a huge British camp that held up to a hundred thousand troops and it was packed elbow to elbow in the summer of nineteen eighteen, and so that definitely did not help UM keep the flu under wraps. It's spread pretty quickly. And then some of those dough boys, those American UM soldiers fighting in World War One who were in Europe made their way back to the United States, and so this this strain of flu that had made its first wave out of Kansas over to Europe came back. And when it came back, it was different in all the worst ways. Yeah, I mean, we were talking about how it got overshadowed by World War One, but it may not have even happened had it not been for World War One, because the conditions of of army boot camp and in shuttling soldiers overseas, like you were saying, it's tight quarters, it's like just dude stacked on each other, all up in each other's faces, and it was just sort of a recipe for disaster. Yeah, while this war was you know, not unfolding, it had unfolded by that point, but it was really just a confluence of factors. It was really kind of staggering. Well, plus also you can make the case that those Kansas farm boys never would have made their way to Camp fund Ston, and they certainly never would have made their way to Europe. So it probably wouldn't have happened, especially if the thing mutated in Europe and got worse. The Spanish flu, Yeah, probably never would have happened had it not been for the First World War. Yeah. The other problem was and there were a lot of factors to why it spread so quickly, but one was because that it didn't really look like the flu in a lot of cases. Uh doctors really quite you know. They they were slow to diagnose as a flu and then as an epidemic because a lot of people were dying from pneumonia and uh sometimes for a while they thought it was bacterial in nature. So they were coming up with vaccines and all this stuff, and none of that was working, and so it kind of took a long time. Even though doctor uh Minor in Kansas was kind of ringing the bell, no one was still paying attention. So it took a long time for them to kind of sound the alarm and say, all right, we got a real problem here, right, And at the time they knew that viruses existed but they still weren't sure what they were. They called virus is filterable agents because they had figured out and I think back in that if you've filtered an infection through something called a Chamberlain candle, which can filter out any in all bacteria, some infections still persist, which shouldn't be the case because you've just filtered out all the bacteria. So that means that there's something smaller than bacteria that they we don't really know about that can cause infection. There's some other pathogen out there, and this is the way that they that they approached viruses um. I think by the time the Spanish fleet was still around, we knew that there was something out there, but no one had actually ever seen a virus, and wouldn't see a virus until I think the nineteen thirties because they're too small for optical microscopes. So the the idea that this was caused by a bacterial agent, it makes a lot of sense. That's what humanity had experience in dealing with entreating. But then on top of it, like you said, so many people were dying or getting pneumonia that it just appeared like it was a horrible material pandemic rather than a viral one or typhoid or cholera, like it was misdiagnosed all over the place because some of these symptoms were just unusual, Like bleeding out of the ears. It's so bad. When you're bleeding out of your ears, things are going badly for you. Like, it doesn't get much worse than bleeding out of your ear. You have serious issues if you're bleeding, unless, of course you've like you know, nicked the inside of your ear with your fingernail. If you're bleeding out of your ear from inside of your head, that's bad news. Yeah, I just want to make sure I'm on the record as being having that position. I'm bleeding out of your ears anti ear bleeding pretty much. Um and with the war effort, Like again, it's just all these things are kind of happening at once. So it was sort of just kind of sneaking through the back door and like the worst way you could ever imagine. So this is all going on. Uh, the reason we we do know so much of aut it and I know that it hasn't gotten all the attention of like the plague and things like that, but in the medical community it has they weren't like, all right, well that went away. That's great. Like here in modern times, like starting in the nineteen thirties, they started, you know, on the download collecting blood samples and examining tissue slides and getting you know, either from from people who had died, like from the bodies, or from people that were still alive that survived it. And they have really been doing all this kind of cool like almost like a criminal case like this research to try and learn because you know you can only you don't want something like this to ever happen again, right right, Well that one of the scary things, Chuck, is that like most people who are in public health and epidemiology and virology say like, yeah, this could totally happen again, and it would probably be way worse because of our connectibility, how connected we are. Um, we probably have a greater chance of containing it, just because of the the advances in public health that we've we've undertaken thus far. Um. But the it could, it could happen. I actually talk about this a lot, including the Spanish flu and um this one biotech episode of the End of the World, and it it from what I saw it, it could very well happen just about any time. Well this other part I don't quite get, Um does it does this strain still exist or not? Because it was a little confusing in that part. Okay, get this too. It had gone totally extinct it it had come and gone as we'll see it just basically, maybe it burned through everybody, It killed off everybody so fast that it couldn't spread any longer. And like you said, flu viruses mutate like very frequently, so also our body. Like if you survive a viral infection, you typically are conferred immunity for the rest of your life. So the people who are left, we're not going to catch the Spanish flu again. Okay. So um. And it had run, it run its course, gone extincts so much so that not even just the strain of flu, but all H one N one flus left human circulation. By the fifties nine fifties. Somebody, this dude named Johann Houlton, who was a microbiologist in the fifties and then later on in the nineties, he went to a little town called Brevig, Mission, Alaska, and he dug up the corpse of a Native American woman and an upac woman who had died and who had been buried in a mass grave from the Spanish flu, and took samples of her lung tissue and took it back to another microbiologist whose name I cannot remember, who basically synthesized the genome of it. Okay, great, we understand it genetically, we've got it. No, they went one step further and actually created the Spanish flu virus again, resurrected it from extinction. And yes, the Spanish flu is still around because humans brought it back to life. All right, Well that makes more sense now, I mean in one way, right, Not not that it's a great thing to do, but well, what's funny is like, if you depending on what you read, like if you read like a popular mechanics article about it's it's like, this is an amazing, great achievement. But for my money, it was a terrible achievement. I don't I really don't think we should have taken that extra step and resynthesized it. Although admittedly we have learned a lot about the Spanish flu from that process, but I think there you could have still stopped short from resurrecting it from Extinctioneez. Yeah, alright, So we talked a lot about the three waves, which is really unusual, uh for an epidemic like this. Um it, I mean it had happened before. I'm thinking the sixteen hundreds and eighteen hundreds. Um, but this was a whole different sort of beast. So that first wave hit in the spring of nineteen eighteen, uh, specifically like March and April. It was in the US, it was in Europe, and it was in Asia. So it's already I mean, that's some serious ground that it's covered already, thanks again to World War One. Yeah, exactly. So, Uh, this this one wasn't like super super deadly. Uh. Military bases and camps was where it was mostly found. But again with these troops moving everywhere, it was really kind of moving fast. The second wave was the really really deadly one, and that's one where I mentioned it. Over about a four week I'm sorry, four months, sixteen week period, it did most of the killing, uh that fall, with October being the most deadly month in the United States in the history of the United States. To this day, it's the deadliest month. A hundred and ninety five thousand people died in America from the flu in October of nineteen. Yeah, like literally everyone was touched in their family, like there's no way to escape it almost at that point. Yeah, and I mean like we'll talk about it later, but like this is that's how a society can can crumble. That's how like a small community can crumble when that many people die, I that quickly, Like things, things just get out of whack for to say the least. Yeah, So this one. They think that the reason this one came back so deadly was because it mutated over that summer and came back even more lethal than it was before. And uh, some people who had been infected by that first wave did have some immunity on that second wave, which is pretty interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I guess if you survived the first wave, you would, especially if it was just a slightly mutated version of the exact same strain. I could see that. Well. That's what I wondered though, is like how much does something have to mutate before that immunity doesn't count? Well, I don't know, we should say chuck two um, Like we're speculating here that the first wave and the second wave were the same strain of fluid um. That's never been proven in the same the like fluid samples and the tissue samples that you said they took back in the thirties, those were all from second wave victims and survivors. We don't have any samples from the first and maybe not even the third wave, but definitely the bulk, if not all, of the samples we have, and so all the studying we've done has been from that second most deadly wave. So they may not have been the exact same strain, but it is weird that people would have had an immunity to that second wave if they've been through the first. Yeah, I think it was connected for sure. I do too. So third wave hits after a short period of time. This was less widespread, not as severe as the deadly second wave, but worse than that first wave, which was not so deadly. And um, this was mainly through like the beginning of nineteen nineteen through April of nineteen nineteen. Yeah. Ed points out that, like, it depends on where you're talking about, but it was much more sporadic geographically. It wasn't like all from from January to April the whole world didn't have the flu It's just around the world that that that flew outbreak is still going on, but not everywhere. Should we take another break? Let's all right, We're gonna take another quickie and then talk about kind of what also made this especially deadly. Right after this, all right, we're going to talk about what made this so deadly in addition to the war going on at the same time, there was some other weird, weird factors and characteristics of this this flu. Right, we mentioned young and healthy people already, but it bear saying again. The death rate for people between twenty five and thirty four was really really high. And conversely, uh, children were infected at a high high rate. It's not like they weren't getting it, but they had a low mortality rate. And nothing about that makes sense. Yeah, So for for the twenty five to thirty four age group, who you would think would probably be the the the um, the highest group of survivors, they had a two times higher death rate than the forty five to sixty four age group during the Spanish flu, which was ancient. Yeah yeah, really, I mean, if the average life expectancy normally was something in the forties to the fifties, that is kind of ancient. Actually, I would be on death's door in n Yeah, and and just like with a just like with a typical flu infants and the very elderly and people with compromised immune systems. Uh, they died in the greatest numbers. But when you look at that graph that there's a huge spike among like young healthy adults, UM, where they're normally shouldn't be. And there's a lot of theories about why that happened. UM. One reason is because it was spread among soldiers, and those soldiers were starting to come home at the time, so they spread it to their wives who were about the same age. Uh, they spread it to their children, they spread it to their friends, So it definitely was hanging around a specific age group. But they also think that there was a large amount of deaths and that this also accounts for the pneumonia deaths that killed so many people. UM something called the pyto keine storm, which sounds like terrifying to me. Yeah, that is uh, when you have such an overstimulation of immune cells that it just generates. Basically, you you drown in your own flegm because of an over stimulation of immune cells, creating so much fluid, like your immune system is so good and so healthy it kills you. Your immune response is so massive. And this is that they're just starting to understand cytokine storms. Cytokines activate immune cells, and they that's what causes the inflammation, the the the water on the lungs, which then gets infected by bacteria, which gives you pneumonia, which can kill you. Um. They they're just starting to understand this, but they have linked it to the appearance of new flues that people haven't been exposed to before. And this is probably the number one reason why people UM who were young and healthy adults died in such numbers because their age group hadn't been exposed to any H one N one flu before. So not only was this a new h new strain of H O and N one to their bodies, this is a brand new type of virus that they've never been exposed to. And so people whose immune systems were um overamped died from these cytokine storms. They think, Man, Another usual thing was how fast it killed you. U. There were cases where you would literally say, I'm not feeling so good and then twelve hours later you were dead. Can you believe that? Yeah, it's victims died very very fast, um, which you know, when people are dying this quickly, it just compounds. And then you've got like hospitals and overflowing with people, and then you can't care for them, and then people being turned away because they're too full, and then they spread it more. And I mean there were reports of people toe tagging people that were still alive. They just knew that they were going to be dead soon. Did you see that American Experience documentary. It was really tough, like what the apparently bedside manners just developed in the last couple of decades. Because but did it well, yeah, that's a good question. But I mean, can you imagine going to the doctrine, the doctor saying like, better get in line for a casket. Son. Yeah, it's of year old. Yeah, we're telling your twelve year old that you just punched that doctor in the mouth or putting a toe tag on a live person. That's just nuts. But that's that's there's verifiable reports that they did this. Of course back then, if you were twelve, you've you've seen a lot of life kid here middle eight, you you you've had two full careers, right, you retired from coal mining at seven, but get yourself fitted for that casket because you're not going to live to see thirty like your old man. And here's the lollipop. So sad. I know we're making fun of this, but that's the only way I can get through it. Another thing that it did was, um, well, we've we've already kind of hit on this a lot, but how far, how quickly it went so far? Uh And again, largely because of this war and because it was it was attacking people so violently and quickly like US, towns in the United States tried to quarantine themselves, but it was just too late. Like it was, you couldn't stem that tied at that point, you couldn't. There was a guy on the American Experienced documentaries who lived through it as a boy, and he was saying, like it was, it was coming our way. It was coming down the highway toward US. Just town after town would get his flu outbreaks, and his town tried to quarantine themselves, but the mailman brought it in. And you know, if it's not the mailman, it's gonna be somebody else. If you have a soldier returning from home from Europe, you're not gonna be like, you can't come home yet. We gotta wait till this this potentially never ending flu epidemic goes away before you can come back home. Like there's just some way it's going to get through. And it got through apparently everywhere except New Caledonia and American Samoa. Yeah. Um. Another thing, another characteristic of it was the symptoms that had so like, in addition to bleeding out of your ears, you would get mahogany cheeks, these weird brown spots on your cheekbones. You would turn blue because your your lungs were not oxygen eating the blood nearly enough, so your extremities and your face and lips would turn blue. Um. You. There was a nurse in that documentary that said you needed to basically be on guard at all times because people would shoot blood out of their nose across the room and like you would just have to step out of the way to not get splattered by it. Um. Like people would scream when they were touched even lightly. It was just an astoundingly bad flu. There was vomiting, nausea, um like, delirium, just every every horrible symptom you can think of. People basically had and this is like if you're a doctor at the time, you're not like, oh, this is the flu. You were like, what is this, I've never seen anything like this before. Well, and again that led to it getting even worse because of the confusion again over symptoms. How slow they reacted because of the war, Like it's really hard to imagine a pandemic outbreak coinciding with the World War. Yeah, like the likes of which the war the world had never seen at that point. Yeah, you know, and they said that, you know, people had room to really focus on one thing, and they had to choose between the war and the flu pandemic, and they chose the war instead. Well, because it was also a time I mean, not to make two light of it, but back then it was when you know, like you're not really sick, like pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get to work, right, you know, people dying over there. People didn't have the most sympathy for for you know, sickness like this, get yourself fitted for a cast, get stuff complaining. So eventually they did, but it was just that slow slowness to react that that made it such a health crisis, especially in the US. Yeah, it's not like they didn't know that there was such thing as infectious disease, and that if you banned public gatherings and said no, you you know, we got to close these movie theaters or these bars, or not hold these parades, that it would have a positive effect on public health. But they chose willfully, uh, the people in charge chose not to out of a sense of patriotism and nationalism and um the idea that you didn't want to have any impact on morale. That public health commissioners around the country were just ignoring it, and in in cases where they weren't ignoring it, they were outright downplaying it in the press, saying this is not this is not a thing. It's fine, like any any reports you're hearing are overblown. And there was one commissioner in particular, guy named Wilmer Krussen, who was the health commissioner of Philadelphia. Hard They got hit the worst out of any American city, and it was because of this guy and the moves that he made, and one of the big ones, one of the biggest mistakes he made, knowing full well that there was a flu pandemic going on in his city, he allowed a Liberty Parade to take place in Philadelphia in September late September um, where two hundred thousand people showed up to the parade, and within a few days Philadelphia had it worse than anybody. In one day, seven d fifteen time people died in Philadelphia and one day within a week or two of this parade taking place, like the parade was, was you know, moment zero for the real spread of the pandemic in Philadelphia. And it was this guy's fault. Yeah. That and with his declaration a virus and every cheese steak, I don't know, it depends on the virus. I might still eat the cheese steak to tell you that. Oh man, I love a good cheese steak. Oh yeah, it's hard to find him in Atlanta. It really is pretty good. Ones. What he's, of course, over near the park is kind of the the old standard. Do you like it? Though? What he's it's all right, I mean it's pretty traditionally Philly like, is it. I thought they like left off the cheese was and put on ketchup. Really they don't put on ketchup. I think they do well. I just had one and had no ketchup. On it. Well, maybe they changed the recipe, because I swear to God that I've had one with ketchupon it there really I know. Did you ask for a bloody Oh yeah, that was the problem. I asked for it with ketchup. They do. They do bastardize it with the They have one version with bacon. Uh, that is not as good as you would think, Like everything isn't better with bacon. That's absolutely true because what they do is a it's not like strips of bacon wedged in the role. It's it's diced up and cooked with the meat. And normally I would say like, oh man, sign me up, but it's something about it just didn't work here. Yeah, I think. Plus the fact that pigs are smarter than dogs also makes makes things less good with bacon sometimes too. What yeah, there's really smart, I know, But well you gotta bring dogs into this. Have you seen like that that peta ad it's like a pig. No, it's a a labrador's body with the pig's head on it. And it said like if if pigs looked like this, would you eat them? Or so then they got a bunch of a bunch of stuff for it. It's a pretty weird looking at too. Yeah, I would say, so. Um, all right, so let's let's talk about let's wrap this puppy up, okay, and the legacy of of the pandemic of nineteen eighteen, the Spanish flu also called the Spanish Lady and the Blue Death, and I think Flanders disease in Germany, Flanders. Not sure why. Maybe it started h near a place called Flanders. Yeah, and in Belgium, I belief. But that's I mean, that's a pretty long standing tradition is blame some neighbor you don't really like for the flu that's killing off your population. You know, well, this was all blamed on Spain. They had nothing to do with it. You don't want to call it like us flu or anything now. So I want to say one more thing though, Chuck. So we talked a little bit about the um about the society breaking down, right, you said that people ran out of caskets. I don't think like we really got that across. Like, put yourself in a mind where they're so many dead people all of a sudden that you don't have any caskets to put them in anymore. You have to wait for them to to hurriedly build more caskets unless the people that build the caskets are dead. Yeah, that's another real possibility to like imagine building a casket, falling into it from the flu, and well they just leave you in there because you are dead. Now. Well, but that's what I mean, Like we're kind of kidding. But when I said it altered humanity, Like in a small town, what if the doctors died and the teachers died, and then there were towns that may have survived, but they had no infrastructure because there were no cops or doctors or teachers or you know, police, like you know, it was it was killing everybody. So yeah, so you could just be left, you know, with a bunch of twelve year olds, right, yeah, yeah, it's children. Are the corn up in there? It kind of was. I'm sure that happened to a lot of towns that are now run by children as out of custom. Maybe, so that's probably where it started. But but the other thing that that was a casualty of the Spanish flu, especially in small towns, was like civic life because if you were healthy, you looked at other people on the street with suspicion. If you went out at all. You didn't stop and talk to people and say hi. Maybe you didn't do all the things that keep like a community glued together. And so communities started to fall apart. And then when public officials finally did start to react, they shut down schools, they shut down bars, they banned gathering. Some towns banned funerals, like you couldn't have a funeral for your your dear departed mother. You had to leave her in a box on your porch for the undertakers to come get on an open wagon, like it's the medieval plague collectors, you know. I mean, this was nineteen eighteen. I know that sounds like a long time ago. But this wasn't the sixteenth century. No, no, So this is this was going on, and at the same time, it wasn't leaving a genuine, lasting national impression on America or anywhere really in the world that I could see, which is bizarre. Well, yeah, that's one of the weird things about its legacy is and again we had to keep hammering this home. But because of the war, it wasn't like the Spanish flu went away, which was really weird. It went away very much. Uh, kind of quickly and no one really knew why. Um, but it's not like that happened. And then they were like, all right, well man, we really need to change public health policy, and we really need to to get all these breakthroughs and sanitation and vaccinations going and really really take care of things. Now they kind of were just like, oh, well, thank god that's gone, and it would be decades before they made real changes in policy to to help prevent something like this, which is bizarre because you would think, like, you know, when something like that happened, it would have that effect, but it didn't. It just didn't like there were there were no teachable Oprah moments from it. It was just like you said, everybody was glad it was gone. Yeah. I thought the bit that Ed included about Woodrow Wilson had I had heard this before. It was really interesting. Um. He was was US president at the time. He got the flu in January of nineteen nineteen. Obviously did not die from it, but there are people and historians that say that it altered him so much, um, that it left him very paranoid, very secretive, and even caused him to impose harsher reparation reparations on Germany uh in the Treaty of Versailles, which basically crippled Germany, which led to the right of the rise of Nazism and the Nazi Party, which led to World War Two. So World War Two may have never even happened. Who knows had it not been for Woodrow Wilson being sick with the Spanish flu. Maybe it's bizarre, it's a bit of a leap, but I have other people I've heard that case made. I've seen it too, that he he just kind of changed and apparently took a completely different tack than he originally had intended as reparations against Germany. Yeah, and in in US towns, it wasn't. I mean, this was the time when people opened up their door to a stranger if and they were in need, and that really changed that. Like people were, like you said, they not only were they not hanging out on the street, but like people were turning people away at gunpoint, and people were taking their own lives and the lives of their family. It was just like it was brutal. Yep, it was brutal. And it's weird that it's not, you know, more recognized than it is. But hopefully we just contributed it to being remembered forever, that's right. But we now know today because we have continued to study the flu of uh really how a pandemic can play out. And it's not like uh science has forgotten. They are still studying the causes and the repercussions and what we can do better. It's really interesting. Yeah, it's fascinating, is what it is. By God, If you want to know more about Spanish flu, there's a lot more to it. We talked about everything we possibly could, but there's it's just big. So you can go search for it in your handy search bar of your handy UM search engine on your handy computer. Do that. And since I said that, it's time for chuck. Oh, yes, you say it? Okay, administrative details, all right, everybody, This is the time of the show. Every quarter or so's it quarterly? Roughly? Yeah? Definitely after um uh the holidays, because we're thankful for everybody who thought of us over the holidays, that's right.
