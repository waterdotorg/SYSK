Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. With me as always is Charles W. Chucker's Chuck Chucky Bride of Chucky. You paused as if you forgot who I was. I had a thing. I have marble mouth, whereas the unusual to Here we go, this podcast brought to you by Jolly Rancher. Have you ever mixes with Ziema? No? But you know that Oakland Raiders former Oakland Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell just got busted with. They call it purple drank and it's it's like it's codeine syrup and I think some sort of carbonet soda and Jolly Rancher, Wow, that's robo tripping is what he's doing. Well, it came out of the Houston, Texas scene like ten years ago. We're drink. I never heard of That's how square I am. I haven't heard of it either, So don't feel bad. Okay. Plus, it's like that's what they do in Houston. Seriously, that what you want your town associated with? Yeah, we use code dean water. Yeah, we came up with purple drink. Wasn't he the QB for l s U. Yeah. Hey that guy, Well he's a bust. He's nothing. Now, well he's a big wash. Really. Yeah. He went to the NFL and got all fat and through interceptions and he was great for LU team. He was so Anyway, I guess what all that leads us to, Chuck is saunas. Yes, football players, Well they probably your steam room guys. Yeah, let's talk about That's a great place to start, Chuck. There's a difference between a sauna and a steam room. There's a number of differences, but the mode of heat is what's really different. Right. Yeah, And I should point out we called this Saunas colon more interesting than you think for a reason because Robert lamb Our, a steam writer and uh stuff from the Sience Lab. He wrote this and he told us like months ago, He's like, dude, you should do saunas saunas. It's way cooler than you think, and it's dirty and filthy and Mike and he was right steeped in history. Yeah, this is uh for my money. Robert Williams the best writer on how stuff works out com ever. Um, but he wrote an altogether pleasant article that I've read like many, many times, and every time you just loved the way he wrote it. It's a great article. We should read the first line, please do. The first line of his article says, you're going to want to read this article naked, So please, before you go any further, disrobe completely. So if you're in the confines of your own home, yeah, if the shades are drawn and you're an adult, there's no one else around that you're uncomfortable with. Very specifically, Chuck is only talking to people who are we'll just go with twenty one years of age and older. And you're alone in your house, And if you're listening to your podcast and you feel like doing so naked right now, please do right now. Saunas more interesting than you think. Thank you. Brought to you by Jolly Rancher. Uh, Chuck, we were talking about the difference between a steam room and a sauna. A steam room is heated by moisture vapor, water vapor. Uh. And for that reason, the average steam room is going to be about a hundred and four degrees fahrenheit, which is forty degree celsius. Right, pretty hot it is, but you can't check it up much hotter than that, and the reason why is because it feels so much hotter than it is because it's a moisture rich environment and our body cools by sweating, and then the sweat evaporating off of the skin that creates our cooling sensation. Well, in a steam room, you sweat, you sweat buckets, but it never evaporates because for evaporation to occur, the environment, the ambient air has to be drier than your skin, and if it's equally dry or it's wetter, then your sweat is not going to evaporate, no cooling effect, right, which is why sweating while you're swimming is is and it's a problem, it's yeah, which is what I do. Yeah. And then in a sauna, conversely, this is dry heat, so it's gonna be a lot hotter temperature wise in there, right, Yeah. I mean, if a steam room is a hundred and four degrees fahrenheit average, you're talking a hundred and seventy six degrees fahrenheit. It's hot eighty degrees celsius in in your average sauna. And I do you like saunas and steam rooms? You do. I've never really sat in the steam room, but I love saunas. Actually, growing up. There's a holiday in in Toledo that um my family had a pool membership too, and they had a sauna. Who wha, wha, wha wha. You could get a pool membership to a hotel in Toledo in the seventies, seventies and eighties. Yeah, yeah, I never heard of that. But I mean now that I look back, I'm like, yeah, that's really really weird. Probably a membership, your dad was probably yeah, we got a membership kids, come right, I wonder actually had a room key? Is we had I'm pretty sure we had a membership, but I don't remember. But they had a sauna for sure. Uh. And so I was introduced to the sauna like really early on. It was like just a normal thing. So when you were a little kid, you enjoyed it because it seems like such an old person thing or an adult thing to do here in the West. If you go to Finland, baby, they are all about the saunas. I mean, it's like their national pastime, right actually, um, in their national epic, Chuck, it's called the calla Valla. This is a little side side note that it's their national epic, very very old. Uh. It mentioned saunas frequently. Well, of course, okay um, there's about one point six million saunas in Finland and uh. The first description of a Finnish sauna dates back to eleven thirteen. The Ukrainian historian Nestor wrote about him. That was my goats name, Nestor? Really did you name it after the Ukrainian history house? That was eleven and named him after the Ukrainian storian. It was either that or Plato. Did your goat love a good fitz? Uh? No, but he drank coke from a bottle, which was kind of cute. That is so cute. It's cute with goats. It's not very cute when you see a human baby drinking coke from a bottle, which I've seen and it's disturbing. Really. Yeah, if you're seen, like a one year old drinking a bottle of Coca cola, no it ain't right, man, Yeah, that's not right at all. It's better than an espresso shot, I guess, but not much there. And by coke, of course, I'm using the Southern colloquialism for coke, which means any kind of soda poptu c o a. As always, man, we got really far off of saunas, didn't we let's go back, So Finland saunas are associated with it, and for good reason. Right, did you read the article about the Finnish navy fighting pirates. Yeah, they have saunas on the pirate fighting boats. Yeah. And not only that, the Finnish army and Kosovo built twenty saunas for their for their fighters over there, like troops, eight hundred troops, and they have them in prison yeah, finished prisons. Yeah, it's it's literally a part of daily life. If you go camping and you're finish, you take along a portable sauna while you're camping, like people take saunas every day. It's like showering to us, and this is an addition to showering. They shower a lot too. Yeah. Before we breathe past the finished prisons on as though, we should uh that this is sort of remarkable to me because we'll find out, as we said that a lot of about being in sauna is being completely naked, especially if you're finished. Americans a little more shy, but we'll get to that in a minute. But I imagine a finished prison sanna is a pretty happening place to be on a Friday night, wouldn't you think. Yeah, because the saunas have something of a reputation, especially in the seventies. Um they developed the reputation for being a swinging gay hangout, right, and that is nothing new actually, um saunas, which we'll talk about later, the history of them. But they were um kind of eradicated thanks to the product start reformation, because they had started, they had started to get pretty. Yeah. Yeah, it's a big party in there. Uh and not just gay either, well, no, all sorts of stuffy prostitution. Yeah, it's honest, word that. All they were missing was a disco ball in uh Andy Warhol and it could have been a studio. Uh So let's get but let's crawl back inside the sauna for a minute. Okay, you know all the spruce cedar. Would that looks so nice and feel so good on your bottom? Yes? I always thought that was just like I mean, I knew obviously they weren't gonna put stainless steel in there, but I never really figured out it's would. But I never gave it two thoughts. Right, you would think that it was just a traditional and it is traditional. But at the same time, yeah, it's never been updated in that respect because if you did put in stainless steel, you would leave many, many layers of skin in the sauna from your bottom every time you sat down. Same with plastic um, you'd just be in big trouble. So would absorbs heat, and it remains relatively cool at high temperatures, which is why I mean, it's still warm. Your tookis is hot, but it's not like you're not hurting yourself. Yeah. And Robert also pointed out that it's absorbs steam and stores heat and releases like that fine ceedar smell, right, which is why the youth ceedar and spruce because they have natural aromatics trapped within more than others. Right. I love cedar except pine. But I don't know if you'd want to sit there and smell pine the whole time, would you? Maybe you get a little crazy? I think yeah, I think so, so, Chuck. Let's talk about the original finished sauna, the Savusana. Yeah, it looks sort of like the Unibomber cabin. It's literally a cabin like structure, no windows, no chimney, no chimney, which is important because it is a wood fire sauna. Yeah. And it's a little disconcerting. Apparently, if you have an original savosana, it takes like all day to get it hot enough. You're burning wood, they're smoke in there. Yeah, it's black soot on the walls and this is where you're supposed to go in and sit. Yeah. It sounds very dangerous to me. It does. It doesn't sound healthy, um, which is why the savo sauna UM, because of the eye irritants, the fact that you're inhaling carbon monoxide and all sorts of other stuff UM is generally relegated to sauna purists. According to Mr r L A M. Yeah, but I get the idea that you're supposed to let the smoke clear out as much as possible, Is that right? Yeah? Like, but how how do you do that well? Because you're just letting all the heat out you know? Yeah that he said it seeps through uh in the roof? Yeah yeah. Stick to me, And I mean you're getting hot enough. As a c O, I would say, please do not try to build your own savo sana because you will likely die off. That's what I'm saying. Like, I don't understand how people survive the saunas, right, So, um. They're generally left to sauna purists and the rest of us just use regular saunas. It's just called the sauna. And this is the very recognizable sauna with spruce or cedar would um and a stove. Most of the time these stove called kiowas, are electric these days, although you can have a wood burning kiowa kiowas k i u a s um that has a chimney. So the main feature isn't that it's wood heated for a sava sauna, it's that there's no chimney and you're inhaling. Yeah, and well we should point out to like whether it's wood or gas or electric or whatever, it's not that's not providing the heat. You're heating rocks, right, and then the rocks transfer the heat to the surrounding environment. And if you want to jack the temperature a little bit, remember we talked about steam room, uh huh, that it's heated by water vapor. You can actually use the same thing for a sauna. You take a little water too later from a bucket, splash it on the rocks, and all of a sudden you have with the Finns call loyally, there's a lot in there, I know, and I don't. I'm not big on Finnish pronuncia Asian. I know how to say semohaya, and I'm not even sure I'm saying that right. I'm gonna go with literally literally literally convening. That's Swedish. I'm sorry, Yes, I just said something in Swedish. So since we were talking about the rocks, so we should say that the rocks. It's very important. You can't just throw granite in there, because granite will probably explode in your face. I think it's that hot, sup, But water on real dangers are not good. No, you need unweathered quarry rock. And he listed a few. Hornblenda is my favorite. The one they like the most is, uh, what is it? Periodote, periodotite, peridotite, because there's an there's there's a semi precious mineral called parado. Yeah, so I imagine this is where it comes from. Paradotype or old friend basalt. Yeah, why why can't we get that one? It won't stick in our head like there's no um neural pathway forming when we hear that word. So anyway, paradotite. So those those are the rocks, the unweathered corey rock that that you can use to get really really hot. You can pour water on them. It'll steam, it'll hiss, but it won't blow up in your face right again, which is very important. I was surprised to find that the Swedes don't have a name for the pile of rocks that heat the sauna. They have a name for the stove kios. They have a name for the steam, which is yeah, they don't have a name for the rocks called the pile of rocks. The water on the pile of rocks and make us some really uh josh. You can also have what's called an infrared sauna, and that's the latest and greatest. And people say, people that believe in the infrareds honest say that it actually penetrates like into your bones, which it's good and bad. If you listen to the Butterfly Wings podcast, you know, infred means redder than red on the on the spectrum of light, right yeah, and it's radiation, sure exists, radiation that's good. Basically, what's going on is you're being bathed in infrared radiation. Yeah, so it heats you up. I'm a semi purist. I think yeah, I think I would just like a regular sauna, not a savos stove a key us exactly, kind of like they have at the gym, yeah, or at the holiday and without the old naked men. Well, that is the thing about um SAA's that you're going to run into, chuck is naked men and naked women even depending on why not, Yeah, that's um. Robert made sure to point out that depending on where you are in the world, different cultures have different traditions. Finland, a lot of Eastern Europe, Russia, you can pretty much drop everything. You gotta have your towel though, because you gotta sit on it. Right. You you may be completely naked, but you still have to have a towel for hygienic reasons. You don't want to just sit your butt on the cedar plank where somebody else just said there but because there's a transfer of butt funk. Yeah. But you know what also I thought was funny. He said that they don't like Americans who want to wear like their bathing suit in there. They're really frowned upon because of hygienic reasons. Right, you just cover up with a towel. Yeah, but why is that not hygienic to wear like your speedo in there? Does a butt funk get trapped in the I think the butt funk can make it through the licra to the outside of it. Is that it? Maybe? I don't know. I just thought that was odd because here in the U S we're like, now, you wear a bathing suit for hygienic reasons. That's my point. Yeah, that's some my point. Maybe maybe it's because we don't wash our bathing suits quite as often as we wash our selves are naked bodies. This is a steamy episode. Should know, well, we are talking about nakedness, and we also should mention that, um, same sex saunas are found all over the place in Europe. Yeah, where saunas have traditionally been around for a very long time. Yeah, they tend to have same sex, although they'll also have mixed sex um as well. Yeah there's both. Wait, I'm sorry. The places where the songs have been around the most are more likely to have mixed sex. Places where it went away for a while and came back would have more like same sex saunas. Right right, I was confused. Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe. He says generally offer nude, mixed company bathing. I yeah, mixed company like men and women. You got it? Yeah, in Russian banyas. Did you ever see Eastern Promises? Yes, such a good movie. Has there ever been a more uncomfortable fight scene in your life? Completely naked? A couple of guys, it was you. Yeah, it's awesome movie. Um, it's for adults. It's rated R or maybe n C seventeen even possibly triple X, triple X, triple X. But yeah, there's a fight scene where Vigo is completely naked in a bath house and fights these guys. I can't imagine anything worse than being in a fight when I'm completely naked. I would just that gives me the hives. It does me as well. Yeah, let's talk about sweat. Yeah, let's talk about the science of it. Huh Okay, that's what it's all about. Yeah, but a lot of people who um, who use saunas say that they're very healthy, and as Lamb gets into that goes back to the idea that sweat is excretion and excreting anything is healthy. But he also points out that it's very easy to make this mistake, this this idea of any excretion is good. Has been around for a very long time. And don't forget what we used to use leeches to suck our blood. Um. We used to believe that UM pooping as much as we could was a good idea, UM, which I kind of still into that one. I do too. I'm a big believer in it. Uh. If you're talking sweat, josh, Um, what happens is nerve endings are triggered by heat and it releases a neurotransmitter called acetal colie exactly, and he says there are two point three million sweat glands that all a sudden kick into action, which are also called ekring glands, are different from apo kringla. I feel like I have more, but it's probably not the case. Mine are just overactive. That's possible. Hard working you do, I've seen I've seen you sweat in a seventy degree farrenheight tank which is chili. You have to have a wet suit for that. And Chuck is still sweating again with the swimming and sweating. Uh So he claims that in a fifteen minutes sauna, the average person sweats about four cups about a leader of sweat, which is way more for me in fifteen minutes, right yeah, I sweat about a gallon in fifteen minutes. I guarantee that's a lot, man. A leader of sweat is a lot of water to lose. It is, you know. But you should see me in a sauna. It's awesome. It's one of the best feelings. But I'm not exactly uh sweating out toxins, am I. No, you're sweating out salt uric acid, not to be confused with Robert uruk um. And that's pretty much it. You can you can you do excrete toxins, right yeah, but not much. No. For the most part, toxins are excreted through your kidneys. This is your go to um excretion, right um. And the researchers have found that in heavy sweat, about one percent of mercury found in the bloodstream is released, where the other that's released goes through the kidneys. It either comes out in the stool or the urine, right right, uh. And this is it has no the The concentration of a toxin in the blood stream appears to have no bearing on how much is released through the sweat. It's almost like our sweat glands are set up to just do one percent. But people who use saunas, say, man, one percent of a concentration of mercury. Yeah, yeah, that's definitely worth fifteen minutes in the sauna. Absolutely, you know, so they can. But I think it's not just feeling healthier. They're saying, Look, there's a science behind it as well, right right, exactly. Um. Another benefit of a good sauna sweat or a good sweat period is this really good for your skin. It opens your pores, keeps them nice, impliant, and the uh there's a study by the Journal of Dermatology that said, you know, a regular sweat from a sauna has a proactive effect on your skin and like helps out with ex amaun and all kinds of dry skin conditions. And also um Land points out that we have long associated like bathing rituals with kind of um clearing away the like a spiritual the psychic funk. Yeah yeah, not just bottom funk, but head funk. Yeah. Uh. And anybody who's felt poorly uh and it's taking a shower can attest to that. You just feel better somehow after a shower, And there's nothing worse than the feeling of taking a shower, stepping out and still feeling bad because you know it's gonna be another twenty four hours before and you're going to feel start to feel good. Like you know, you've screwed up big time if you take a shower and you still don't feel good afterwards, right you are, Josh, A great shower, like a great sweat or a good steam. Good fits good, fits does a body good. Um, we're talking about the Russian banya, the saunas there the bath house. They also would beat themselves. I think they probably still do. You would flog your skin with what's called the venic and it's a bundle of leafy branches like oak and maple and birch branches, right, And by doing that, they're they're stimulating circulation because the skin's like, what's gonna quit that? Send some blood there, find out what's going on, right, let me know what's going on after you get there. See, And um, that's what that's what the skin is doing, right. Uh. And it also um produces a mild euphoric effect apparently releases the plant oils, which is also a good thing. And uh yeah, he said. It stimulates the production of opiate endorphins and it's like a mild narcotic effect crazy, which I love that that those three words together. Mild narcotic effect, that's great. It's almost like cellar door. Mild narcotic effect. That's better than massive narcotic effect. Right, and then you're in trouble. Then that shower doesn't work. Um chuck. Also, saunas produce a mock fever. Yeah, I thought that was kind of cool. So your internal body temperature can raise as much as five point four degrease fahrenheight, right, and uh, the temperature at your skin can increase by as much as eighteen degrees fahrenheight. That's a lot. That is a serious amount. And by doing that, your body is like, Okay, I'm sick. I need to jack my immune system up. So white blood cell count or white blood cell production is increased. UM. The limph nodes, which are another internal waste system, a very important one, UM, are flushed. Uh, and you start to sweat even four even further. Yeah, but it doesn't increase your blood pressure. Increases your blood pump circulation circulation, but not your blood pressure. No, but if you do have high blood pressure, we should say saunas are not recommended for you. Well, we should just go ahead and say, who all, it's not recommended for kids and old people, it's not recommended pregnant ladies. Um, but it is good. Um, like those people shouldn't get in, but women definitely might want to get in because it apparently alleviates menstrual cramps really well. Right, but if you're pregnant again, you want to stay away from the sauna if you're pregnant, right, very very astute point, Chuck, thank you. Um. Lastly about physiology and saunaing, Um, what you want to do is keep yourself very hydrated because the irony is while you're excreting that one percent the go to excreaseing excreting organs, the kidneys need water to excrete the other and if you're sweating all of it out, things get backed up toxic levels, raising your body and you can do some real damage to yourself. So every time you go into the sauna, you want to take a jug of water with you with at least a leader. Right. Yeah, I would say if you have gout, the sauna is probably a good place to go. You think so, oh, because you're a acid builds up. Yeah, it's your all this is a build up. If you're a acid and you're well, your is you're a acid. So if you have gout, can get thee to a sauna. Okay Um, And there was one other cool thing about the physical Oh the reason they one reason they recommend heart patients not getting saunas is because one of the traditions is to jump from the sauna, either into a snow bank or into a cool pool water in Finland, Yeah, and shock your body. And the old urban legend that you heard when your kids about going from the hot tub to the pool and you'll you'll drown because your pores are open. That's so not true. Actually, it's big in Turkey too. There's the Turkish bath, which is like a hot tub and then a cool tub, right, and you go from one to the other. I did not know that far as I know, that's what I've always heard it. I had no idea. Um, Chuck, I think it's high time we talked about the history of the sauna. And saunas are very very old. Yeah, Neolithic tribes. I love how he tied culture and uh humans like culture springing up around human physiological needs and bathing he said was like the first people that bathe and hot springs lead to saunas. They're like, wow, this is fantastic. I really like this. Yeah. Um, And I think in France and Spain especially, a lot of the Neolithic settlements are located very close to hot springs and not by accident either. Right. No, Um, as people were remained nomadic, apparently, we started creating collapsible, portable saunas that resemble like sweat lodges in Native America. Um. And then as we began to settle down and become sedentary, uh, they made more permanent structures like dugouts in Earthen dugouts uh. And then eventually the Savo saunas, and then which remember day back at least to the twelfth century, right, that's the humily a lot further than that. Apparently, as Finland settled by modern Finns, um, the the sauna was pretty much brought with them. Yeah. And through the Middle Ages it was like the common people. It wasn't just for the rich or anything. The common like whole villages would would sauna together, sweat it out together, men, women and children, and at the local bathhouse they would actually feast inside the sauna. Yes, is really gross. It is they would get married, um, and they would get they would have babes on. Yes, prostitution what they called the stews was the nickname they had. Yes, Yeah, that's not a stew. You want to eat with crackers, um maybe afterwards, yeah, perhaps. So this this association, like we said, with saw and places where you could find a prostitute and have sex with said prostitute. Um. And just kind of that Roman diane ie in orgiastic um kind of vibe going on in the Saunus was one of the reasons why they were eradicated by Europe because in the early sixteenth century Europe got a little tense. Yeah, Protestant Reformation just ruined everything. Yeah, they're kind of like, you can't do that you put a put a hat with a buckle on right now. Yeah, you can't do that either or that or that or that right, get out to start crying right now, let me teach you what guilt is all about. Right. And then that lasted for about five hundred years, and then finally in the late twentieth century, thanks to the nineteen sixties, people began to loosen up again and get climbed back into the sauna right, and the sauna immediately became associated with sex again, like the gay bath houses that we were talking about. Have you ever seen in the band played on? Uh No, but my brother worked on that. I think we talked about that. Um and I think you said they your brother worked on it too, But um, Phil Collins plays a bath house owner, and I think it's Richard Gear who's like trying to track patient zero, is trying to convince him to like shut down the bath house because there's like this epidemic that no one's paying attention to. That back then they called gay cancer, which is now called HIV or AIDS. They called the gay cancer they did originally crazy Yeah, um, and so the bath houses featured prominently, and Sauna's feature prominently in the bath Houses Phil Collins, Phil Collins SUSU studio was Yeah, they did a good job the bath house. I think we talked about what a good job Phil Collins did too. Dude, that was a long time ago. So if that's the case, then people, you know, that's like a two year old podcast. So I don't mind repeating things every once in a while. We should do one on things to do with the Dead body or synesthesia. That'd be a great one. That's what SKO shouldn't. That's what sk so chuck. The saunas make their comeback now. You can find them at holiday inns around the world. Actually it's not true. I've never seen a sauna at a holiday in since they had my last really crappy job. They had um a gem in the building, which was one cool part because you could go down, like during lunch and work out and they had a saun in there and I would work out and then I would could theoretically I did for a time, and I would go sit in the sauna and it's just the best man. Yeah, just sitting there just like there's something. I see why the intercourse happened, because there's something very primal about just sitting there naked and just sweating and sweating and sweating. But I never had a desire to like eat food or meet anyone special. You know what I'm saying? Is that clear? Yeah? I got it. I get hint hint um. For those of you can't see, I just winked that, chuck um uh so chuck. Let's say that you have been inspired to go out to take a sauna from listening to this, because there's actually something called sauna etiquette that you need to know about. First of all, if you're in a country and they speak German and you decide to go to a sauna, there will be a person in there named the sauna maister. The sona maister is in charge for basically running a very strict ten minute session where your entire job is to go in there and sit down and shut up, right. Uh, basically follow the son of Myster's lead. You're not allowed to leave once the ten minutes has started. You're not allowed to come in once the ten minutes. Definitely, never ever put your hands on that later. No, that's the son of master's job. Do not wet the rocks if you have a son of mister. No, that's that's the song. And I got the impression. I was looking around, I couldn't find anything that wasn't in German and that I could translate. Um, but I get the impression that the sona myster is actually a paid professional. Well I hope, because if someone's just doing that for kicks, then no, you know, there's like jerks out there, They're like, I'm the so on a monster, come here, all the time. Yeah, it's like no one a mister. It just goes on like that for a long time. And then they wrist wrestle and what's that? Yeah, they like wrestle. Yeah with that with just towels on. God, how about those guys that walk around the gym with the towel over their shoulder but naked, I know? And why are they always like seventy I know? And they pretend like, hey, everybody else is subject to the Protestant Reformation. I'm free. It's like put a towel on, hippie. I don't even like, I'm this close to being a never nude myself, are you? I don't like you have the Denom jeans. Yeah, shower with Denom jeans now, But I don't. I mean, I mean, I'm I'm not into that. Put some clothes on. Protestant Reformation. No one can escape it. Yeah, no one escapes the Protestant Reformation the sun myself. So lastly, with sauna etiquette, basically the whole thing comes down to putting the ladle on. If you're alone in the sauna, feel free to add some loyally, Yeah, do whatever you want. Somebody in there. It's probably one of those things where you want to be quiet and then just say, hey, do you mind if I put some water on the rocks. It's supposed to be a pretty quiet environment. Don't go in there like some chowder head with your cell phone. Right, and um, when you go in and out, you want to come in in out as fast as possible because that open door changes the temperature very quickly. Right, and just be considered, don't be a jerky. I saw him. That just reminded me. I saw The War of the Roses again the End of the Night for like the fiftieth time. And remember Kathleen Turner locks Michael Douglas and the sauna, and then the next shot after he like some like falls out of the sauna is him drinking gatorade in the office. The next day He's got like a gallon of gatorade. And that was good. Didn't Danny de Vito directly? Man, this is one of my favorite movies. Has a brilliant mind. Lastly, Chuck, let's talk about the world record for saunaing. Uh. There is a guy named timok Conan. He is the world championship, Um, well, the world record holder. Finish of course, finish. Yeah. In August two thousand nine, he sat in a sauna. That was he did to two hundred and thirty degrees parent height, which is undred and ten degrees celsius, for three minutes and forty six seconds. You can like warm food at that temperature. You can cook food. Oh yeah, at that temperature. Uh. That my friends of saunas. And again I think Chuck and I would both endorse you going over to the website how stuff works dot Com typing in saunas and just reading this really well written article by Robert Lamb in particular, enjoy it. Yeah, then informative. Uh. And since I said how stuff works dot Com, I'm largely abandoning the handy search bar thing. I think that's run its course. Really. Yeah, So the new the new signal for for um listener mail is how stuff works dot Com. Oh really? Yeah? Okay? Watch I would say it again because I wasn't ready. I was still in handy search bar mode. Okay. Uh, you want to just go over and read saunas at how stuff works dot Com watch us see so you know I can say now it's time for listener mail. I can't control it. I used to be able to control a lot more when I said handy search barah. But oh look it just happened that chu chiming all over the I need to not say anything else. Okay, let's just read the listener mail. How about that, Josh, I'm gonna call this, uh take that Colbet. Oh yeah, Colbert. I recently heard this from Scott in Connecticut. Is that what c T is? Yeah? Okay, I recently heard about your rivalry with Stephen Colbert's Keep a Team. Congratulations on your success. I'm a fan of both your podcast and his show, which is cool. But he has uh he says he wasn't gonna choose sides until late one night when this happened. I know, this is pretty amazing. It's slightly harrowing. I was up late and winding from a long day of working class. I was listening to some vintage s Y s K the Bhutan's Gross National National Happiness episode. After a little while, I noticed a strange smell, a little like overheated electronics. Yeah, ozone, Yeah, this is a scary smell. I sniffed around my computer and noticed that it seemed to be stronger near the door to the rest of my apartment opened it and this visible wave of thick, acrid smoke and gas poured into my room. I ran to wake my housemates, opening as many windows as I could to vent out some of the gas. I'm a smart guy. Uh. It literally tasted like burning. Our eyes and throats were stinging, and we called the fire department. They arrived. They found our oil furnace had basically imploded. Um, those things are dangerous. What oil burnings? Yes, this I don't know where he isn't get a letter from the oil burning up board. Okay, remind me to tell you about high for your toast corn syrup letter. One day, the basement was loaded with carbon monoxide and other compounds you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley, and it had been leaking up into the rest of the apartment. Not for your podcast, I would have gone to bed earlier, never noticed that smell. This is why I mentioned Colbert, you may wonder. As it turns out, my roommate Caitlin, had been watching Colbert upstairs and she fell asleep. She was tripping z s when I woke her up and pulled her to safety. Where was Stephen Colbert in our time of need. He may have a space treadmill named after him and a high profile primetime TV show, but he's no substitute for s Y s K when it comes to riveting and informating, informative late night life saving. I thought I would add another game winning point for team s Y s K Scott in Connecticut. He's also no s y s K when it comes to raising donation loans for the developing world, because we beat the tar out of him on Kiva. Yeah, Kiva dot org slash team Slash stuff. You should know, Chuck, we indirectly save these people's lives. You realize we've saved it quite a few lives at this point, my friend, if only we've been there for the family at the end of storytelling. Yeah, I want to know if we've killed and oh god, so awesome.
