iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:11
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, and this is stuff you should Know. It's one of our overlooked history editions. And Chuck, this is your pick, and hats off to you, Wiggs off to you.

00:00:24
iHeart Intro: Yes, it was my selection to pass along to Livia to help us with. But this is a listener suggestion. This came from gg Cowlin and big thanks to Gigi because I and I'm sure you will agree with me, found that not only is the story of the Compton's Cafeteria Riot interesting in and of itself, but sort of the larger story, or a part of the story, is the fact that how we preserve history because Compton's Cafeteria Riot happened in nineteen sixty six and was almost lost to history.

00:01:04
Josh: Yeah, I agree with all of that, which is.

00:01:06
iHeart Intro: Crazy to think about something that happened in nineteen sixty six in San Francisco could be lost to history. But it almost was if not for the efforts of one Susan Striker, one person like, yeah, this may have really gone away, Oh totally, I mean it had gone away, and she managed to clutch together a bunch of just different tiny little scraps of mentions of it or.

00:01:30
Josh: Put like the neighborhood and just just over the years cobbled together all this little stuff and finally got an idea of it and was able to corroborate it like it was Gonsville until Susan Striker came along.

00:01:43
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and we'll talk about what Susan Striker did with this information. But hats off to you, Susan Striker and Digigi. And here we go with the almost forgotten Compton's Cafeteria riot story.

00:01:54
Josh: Yeah. And the reason why it's significant that it's almost forgotten or it was forgotten for a while, that the Stone Wall Uprising, which was a really great episode we did on that too. That's considered like the watershed moment of gay rights in history, like the riot at the Stone Wall in that was it, that was what started it all. The thing is, when you think of things that way, it erases the stuff that came before that. Yeah, And one of the things that came before Stonewall was the Compton's Cafeteria riot in San Francisco in nineteen sixty six. And there wasn't a lot of difference between the two. It was based on. It was a reaction and a response to police harassment that had been building over the time. It was a multi racial group of LGBTQ people like fighting back against the police that spilled out into the streets. Like it, it bore a striking resemblance to Stonewall. And yet, like you said, there are reasons that we'll talk about that it was just pushed into the dustbin of history.

00:03:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it's very interesting. So as way of setting this up, we'll talk a little bit about the area at the time in San Francisco called the Tenderloin. This is in the nineteen sixties. The Tenderloin has long had a reputation and even still does today in some ways. In the sixties, it was a place where you could go buy drugs or deal drugs. You could go do some illegal gambling, you could get involved in set sex work on either side. It was a neighborhood that didn't have a lot of money, and it was a neighborhood that attracted transience people that teenagers, namely who were either run out of their hometown because they were LGBTQ or maybe even run out of their family or maybe even run out of a different neighborhood in San Francisco to sort of collect in the Tenderloin where they could turn to sex work because they couldn't get other jobs, and they could turn to each other for support in community.

00:04:07
Josh: Yeah, community developed of essentially what one of the people Susan Striker interviewed described as like the lowest drawing on the ladder of not just society of like including LGBTQ society. At the time, these were unhoused, teenage street trans people and like they had no rights, they had no respect from anybody, and yet they still came together and looked out for another, informed that community you were talking about. But they lived in really dire straits day to day, and yet they still formed that community. And the reason why they all kind of ended up in this the Tenderloin is because there was a few square block section of the Tenderloin that that was the only place they could live. And even there they got harassed. But like if they straight out of it, they were beaten. They were You couldn't leave that area if you were trans in San Francisco at the time, And I think Susan striker compared it to a ghetto, essentially that there was a trans ghetto in San Francisco in the sixties.

00:05:21
iHeart Intro: That's right, and just the mirriad people that were interviewed from the time, it's clear that the cops basically could do whatever they wanted in there. They could arrest someone for quote unquote female impersonation. One was arrested. I believe Amanda Saint James, who was a transforman there ran a residential hotel, was arrested for obstructing the sidewalk I saw in this documentary that we're going to talk about later. You know, any kind of cross dressing or drag. They could arrest you for having the buttons on your shirt on. You know what they deemed the wrongs because you know, traditionally the buttons on like men and women's shirts and clothing is reversed. I never understood why was it to draw a distinction between the two when you're shopping.

00:06:13
Josh: I think it's just to be difficult.

00:06:15
iHeart Intro: It may be a short step at some point, but they would say like, oh no, your buttons are on the wrong side. You're impersonating a female, so let me crack your skull and throw you in a jail cell where you will be abused more and by fellow inmates and by the people who ran the jail.

00:06:32
Josh: Yeah. And one of the reasons that this group of people were in such a pickle was not just because there was a small area of the world that they could leave. It's that they couldn't even work because they couldn't get id that reflected their gender, the gender they identified with. If they wanted to work as the gender they didn't identify with, they could just go back to their family that kicked them out in the first place. So to be themselves, to live as themselves is the way that they they they were who they were. They really really suffered and paid for it and were very poor. Resorted to sex work almost across the board unless you were really good at singing and dancing and you could make a living that way. And even those people who are successful at entertaining very frequently were stuck in that area of the tenderloin too. So it was a really it was a it was a tough position to be in. And I mean just the fact that they're like, well, if I want to be myself, it sucks that society treats me this way, but I'm going to be myself. You really have to respect that.

00:07:39
iHeart Intro: Oh yeah, totally. Within this community, there was a place called Compton's Cafeteria which provided a haven late at night. So it was at one oh one Taylor Street, right there in the Tenderloin, and it was a restaurant and it was one of quite a few in San Francisco. It is a small chain, local chain started up by a man named Gene Compton in the nineteen forties. This one opened in fifty four, and it became a gathering place for these people late at night who were unwelcomed even at gay bars. It was very centrally located. It was clean, it was open twenty four hours, it was well lit. It was a place where they could go and have coffee after you know, they got done with work or you know, doing whatever they were doing late at night. And what I really wanted more than anything when I was learning about the story was like I wanted to learn that Compton's Cafeteria was a bright spot in a haven where the owners would run the cops off and let these people do as they as they would and live in peace. Sadly, that was not the case. I didn't get the idea that they were just like completely unwelcome there. But they did call the cops here and there over you know, over the years, and like you know, the cops would come down there and run them out. So that was sort of a one discip pointing spot for me. But that's you know, that's what happened. So that's the way we have to report it.

00:09:04
Josh: So the still I mean, even having to face that, like Compton's was the place you went to because like I was saying, like even in the LGBTQ community, the trans community and the Tenderloin were not well thought of, Like they couldn't even go into the gay bars in the Tenderloin. They were limited also and where they could go. But one of those places they could go was Compton's Cafeteria and go be themselves and like a real like you could check in on one another, you could give each other tips to like steer clear of this guy in this car kind of thing. It was despite the setbacks and drawbacks of going there, it was a place that they could go. Does that make sense?

00:09:49
iHeart Intro: Yeah? And it was also a time, you know, we mentioned that they couldn't even go into certain gay bars. It was a time where the LGBTQ community was starting to organize a little bit, starting to kind of speak up a little bit for like the most basic rights you could imagine. And it was it was through the lens though, of what were called homophile organizations. One was called the Mattachine Society. These organizations where they were gay people, but they were like, hey, listen, I'm middle class, I have a great job, I am gay, and I just I just don't want to be harassed. So they they were organizing, but it wasn't like it wasn't like the kids on the streets, and they weren't They weren't rabbel rising, they weren't radical. In fact, within homophile organizations there were often disputes between some of the sort of you know, middle age more you know, not well healed, but sometimes well healed people sort of disagreeing with people in their own community. Some of these younger kids that were more radical, they're like, we don't even want you in our group anymore, right.

00:10:55
Josh: Yeah, And those those homophile groups are they were the ones they had the connections to say the press or they had a working relationship with the police, department. They were trying to show the rest of society they were respectable people living respectable lives, and so being inclusive of unhoused teenagers who were also sex workers kind of it didn't really stand up to their argument. So they just pretended they weren't there. They excluded him, they kept him out. But what's cool is those same unhoused teenage trans sex workers they were like, well, we'll go organize ourselves. And they were really, really fortunate to have in the neighborhood. A couple of blocks away from Compton's a place called Glibe Memorial Methodist Church, probably one of the more progressive churches in the United States of all time. There was a reverend named Cecil Williams. He was a Civil rights movement VET and he was very much interested in supporting these trans kids who were just getting abused one way or another by every quarter of society, and he helped them organize. Actually they organized into an organization called Vanguard.

00:12:11
iHeart Intro: That's right, and Ceca Williams is still alive. My friend, Oh yeah, he's ninety four years old.

00:12:17
Josh: I saw footage of him preaching and he looked pretty cool.

00:12:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, So that church was there and like you said, just to have any formal organization on your side for these kids who are trying to radicalize the movement was a really really big deal. So Vanguard had formed in sixty five, and through the church and through Ceci Williams and Vanguard, they eventually would help get the Tenderloin recognized as a War on Poverty target district in May of sixty six. Usually when these districts were recognized, it was there were you know, impoverished communities, and usually racism was sort of at the core of what they were facing. But these kids basically stood up with Cecil Williams and they're like, well, no, it's we're suffering the same way, and so we should be recognized thusly, and they were in May of nineteen sixty six.

00:13:11
Josh: Yeah, that was a big deal to get those kind of grants, and that ended up there was like a center for the kids living on the street. There was a van that doled out medical services like it had a pretty good effect, as we'll see. Yeah, so you said that there were times when Compton's Cafeteria would call the police on their patrons, their trans patrons. Apparently that really picked up after Vanguard. It became clear that these trans kids weren't just like keeping to themselves as much as they could, that they were starting to have a little bit of self respect, that they were organizing, that they were getting political. That's apparently when it really started to step up and the vanguard I think at one point picketed outside of Comptons. That was one of the things that they did. And that was a month or so before the riot happened. So you've got these trans kids organizing, starting to have like a certain amount of self esteem and self respect that's coming out of their community, and that that usually leads to pushback from establishment, and that's what happened.

00:14:25
iHeart Intro: That sounds like a great place for a break, my friend, Thank you all right? Well, Josh sat it up perfectly and will be right back to knock him down right after this. I know why a bowling analogy happened just there, I don't know.

00:15:00
Josh: But it was great. I love your sports metaphors.

00:15:03
iHeart Intro: Is bowling a sport?

00:15:04
Josh: Sure?

00:15:05
iHeart Intro: Oh boy, I'm gonna get in trouble for.

00:15:06
Josh: That, Yes you are, I said, sure, everybody.

00:15:10
iHeart Intro: So this is how lost to time the Compton Cafeteria riot has been is they're not even positive. Still what the exact date was, Yeah, Striker did a lot of research Susan Striker, who we mentioned and who will talk a lot more about in this segment. Eventually Striker narrowed it down to August twenty seventh, which was a Saturday, the last Saturday of that month. But we can safely say it was in August of nineteen sixty six, probably late August, very early in the morning, as in Saturday leading into Sunday. And the story is a lot like like you said, it's a lot like Stonewall. The police get called in because things are kind of rowdy. The police get there, start being very physically aggressive with these people, and then one of them through coffee in one of the cop faces, and it was on. After that, Basically it went downhill pretty fast. Other patrons joined in, the cops started fighting back. The cops eventually go outside and retreat, wait for reinforcements. The management, you know, close the place up, and the people inside started breaking the windows, They started trashing the place, they flipped the tables over, they started wrecking it, and you know, the cops showed on, showed up en mass to deal with about sixty people or so that fought the police with their purses and throwing high heels, and I think they destroyed a police car by the end of the night and set a news stand on fire.

00:16:39
Josh: I saw potentially hundreds of people, like the nearby hotels like drained, the bars drained, like it went. It got serious, like after they left Compton's.

00:16:53
iHeart Intro: Yeah, so unsurprisingly some of them were successfully arrested and taking to jail, and Compton's, you know, for their part, basically said from now on, you know, they called them, you know, drag queen patrons at the time said you're not allowed here anymore, no more gay hustlers. Apparently there were there were pickets after that, Like the ensuing days were kind of a mess. They would some people would still go down and picket. They wouldn't be allowed in the restaurant. They started closing at midnight instead of being twenty four to seven and just closed I think like five years after that permanently.

00:17:31
Josh: Yes, but they they it had immediate effects. First of all, it took that kind of sense of organizing among the trans kids in the Tenderloin. It like bolstered it. It gave them like a feeling like, oh, we actually can make things happen together, even if it was violent in the face of police violence. And apparently it had an effect that they the police kind of stopped so casually harassing or beating or even kidnapping the trans kids in the Tenderloin after that, immediately after that, there was an immediate effect.

00:18:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. They ended up having an ally in, a community relations cop named Elliott Blackstone, who basically was like, you know, I would like to help you folks out. I'm going to advocate for an end to these anti cross dressing laws. You won't get harassed for dressing how you want to dress. I'm going to help you get the services that you need. Eventually, a public health unit called the Center for Special Problems started offering their support as well, including getting IDs that reflected their gender identities, which is what you were talking about. That kept a lot of them from getting jobs, and that allowed many of them to go get legal work, and you know, they could leave sex work behind.

00:18:51
Josh: Yeah, I mean it had a significant impact, especially considering that it was forgotten really quickly after that. That was also given credit for establishing the National Transsexual Counseling Unit, which is a support group for trans people, probably the first one in history, and it was a place where like, if you needed a place to stay, they could tell you who to go ask. They could help you fill out applications for hormones and tell you what doctor to go to. It was a mail drop for some people who had just showed up and didn't have a place to live yet. Like basically everything that supported unhoused trans kids in Tenderloin. In the Tenderloin in the late sixties, the Canceling Unit did. And again this Compton's Cafeteria riot is directly responsible for not just saying like, hey, we have these needs that are being completely unmet, where the police are beating us with impunity anytime they feel like it. I read. I read one story where this kid had just shown up to San Francisco and one of the first things he's was another kid laying on the street in agony saying his ribs were broken. And the kid who'd just got into San Francisco was like, well, we got to call the police, and the kid with his rib broken said, the police are the ones that did this to me. And that guy, I think he was one of the vanguard founders. He's like that just crystallized the situation for him almost immediately, but in responding to that with violence. It's sad that it took violence, but they finally stood up and said, no, we're done putting up with this, and that actually had a positive impact in drawing attention to their needs and then getting the city to start responding to those things at the very least recognizing that they exist.

00:20:43
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Absolutely, boy, it would be a kettle of fire as an episode. But I wonder if one day we could tackle protests, nonviolent and violent protests, okay, through the years, because it is a fraught topic.

00:21:00
Josh: Supposedly. I don't know where I saw this, but I think I just saw it today. Something like fifty nine percent of nonviolent organizations are non violent movements succeed in their goals, but only like a quarter of violent movements too. So usually you want to back the non violent ones is if you're betting on it, if you're betting on outcomes of civil movements.

00:21:26
iHeart Intro: So we mentioned forgetting about the riot and how that could happen in nineteen sixty six, not even that long ago relatively speaking, historically speaking, I guess I should say, and how does that happen? And here's how that happens. No one really wrote about it, even in San Francisco. The straight quote unquote straight publications didn't write about it, and largely the gay publications didn't even write about it much. I believe there were a couple of members of the local gay community who wrote about it. A gentleman named Raymond brush Here wrote about it in the nineteen seventy two so this is five years later.

00:22:11
Josh: He was a local, very very radical reverend who was also gay. I think he was a Vanguard founder too.

00:22:19
iHeart Intro: So he wrote about it in the nineteen seventy two Gay Pride program, so just in a program for a Gay Pride event. And then a drag queen at the time named Sandy Green mentioned it, just mention it in a letter to the editor. Again, this is six years later. I'm sorry, five years later, I guess seven years Wow, we got pretty bad the seventy three issue of Gay Pride Quarterly. But it was not It wasn't even remembered in the LGBTQ community in San Francisco, forget about the rest of San Francisco or America at large. And the question is like, why did own wall become the thing? And there's a few reasons. One is that it was in New York and it was the center of publishing, so that certainly didn't hurt a bit and media. Another is that these homophile groups that we talked about in that kind of short three year span from sixty six to sixty nine started to model themselves a little bit more after things like the Black Power movement and the woman's rights movement, and we're a little more sort of activist and action oriented than they were before when they were just in sixty six saying like, you know, can we just have rights like everyone else? Get a little more aggressive.

00:23:41
Josh: And I saw it put in that there was more kindling, Like they were just starting to bring the kindling out at the time of the Compton riots, but by the time Stonewall happened, there's a lot more kindling to go.

00:23:53
iHeart Intro: Up, totally okay, And that's you know, that's another really big reason.

00:23:58
Josh: Yeah, it's pretty pretty interesting stuff. Also, I think the fact that like it was almost purposefully, if not purposefully ignored or just kind of relegated to the sidelines by the larger LGBTQ community in San Francisco, because you know, it was a riot and that really again doesn't jibe with the idea that hey, we're just respectable, middle class Americans who want to live a quiet, respectable life and be left alone. Rioting doesn't really kind of coincide with that. So when you put all those things together, it definitely makes sense that the Compton's Cafeteria riot kind of was lost to history. And the fact that it was written about in just two places or it was mentioned directly is really significant. Like it really underscores what Susan Striker did when she came up with the I guess the detective work of putting the whole thing together.

00:24:56
iHeart Intro: I think that's another great spot for a break.

00:24:59
Josh: Oh man, I didn't even mean to do that. You're just so good.

00:25:03
Chuck: We'll be right back everybody.

00:25:28
Josh: So, back in I think the early nineties, maybe even ninety one, Susan Striker was she was wrapping up her PhD. At UC Berkeley. She was a trained historian. At the same time, she was also transitioning to a woman, and this is nineteen ninety one, so she's basically like, I might as well not even apply for jobs in academia because I'm not going to get one because I'm trans so instead she started volunteering. She wanted to put her historian chops to work, and she decided to volunteer at the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society in San Francisco and the Castro And it was there that I think she first came across that nineteen seventy two Gay Pride Parade program that Ray bro Shears wrote that mentioned the Compton's riot, and she's like, what is this guy even talking about six years later? I think I said, four eight ninety.

00:26:24
iHeart Intro: Two just terrible. Yeah, And you know, when you see this documentary that I promised you were about to name it, you can like Susan Striker is struck by the fact that, like she was just like I couldn't believe what I was reading, almost like how did I not know about this? Like I'm an active member of this community and everyone knows about Stonewall, Like, how did I not even know this?

00:26:49
Josh: Well? She questioned that it might not have even been a thing, or if it was a thing, that Bruce Ears was maybe blowing it up out of proportion.

00:26:57
iHeart Intro: Yeah, but you know, if you know, obviously way pre Internet, there's traditional media, and if traditional media didn't cover it at all, the only thing you're left with is people in oral history. So that's what Striker did. She at first tried to go to the city archive is to look for police records and arrest records, and the archives said, you know, in the sixteen seventies they basically shredded and burned a lot of stuff because of police misconduct, so we don't have anything for that period or that event at least, And so Susan Striker was like, all right, I guess I got to start finding people, like literal humans who were either there or were nearby and knew about it firsthand. And that was really hard to do. I mean, all of a sudden, it's like real detective work going on because Susan Striker is having to track these people down, these people that were living on the margins, you know, fifty years ago I guess at the time about forty years ago. So oh no, lessen that thirty something years. I'm trying to think something like that. And there were there are plenty of different stories, like in one story, she found a trans woman who was a cook at Compton's but was put in a men's prison, was not allowed in interview, and ended up dying before Susan Striker could speak to her, she thought about writing a book and ultimately said, you know what I think this should be. It'll get to more people if I make a documentary out of this. So at long last, we can say that the name of the documentary that Susan Striker along with Victor Silverman made was called Screaming Queen's colon the Riot at Compton's Cafeteria in two thousand and five, which I watched on YouTube. That's great in full under an hour's like fifty five fifty six minutes, but it's also dramatized, which I have not seen, but I'm going to check it out tonight. And Netflix's showed Tales of the City in twenty nineteen that I believe Elliott Page stars in.

00:28:53
Josh: Oh, is that right?

00:28:54
iHeart Intro: I think I saw Elliott Page in the cast, but I didn't dive too deeply yet.

00:28:59
Josh: So there's an Unsung History podcast episode that interviews Susan Striker and that she kind of goes into detail about putting this whole history together and it's kind of thrilling actually, Like it turns out one of her cohorts at the Gain Lesbian Historical Society was a geographer and helped put the like create a map of this vanished area in the tender Loin together, so she started to have like visual, like a visual idea of where these things were happening. And when she was able to finally talk to people who were there, she knew that this thing actually had happened, because she didn't she didn't say, hey, here's all the stuff I found out. Is this right? She was like, have you ever heard of this? And then they would give her all the same information that she already had. She knew that she was definitely onto something. So it's definitely worth checking out. It's a great, great episode. And definitely watched Screaming Queen's too. And the name I think Chuck was in that there's an initial newsreel about the tenderloin the red light district down there. Yeah, and they mentioned how Compton's Cafeteria recently had to start closing at midnight and they chalked it up to a sidewalk fight between screaming queens as how they put it like they just basically made it sound like it was a cat fight that got out of hand. The police weren't even involved. Wow, And and That's how they explained how Compton started closing at midnight. So even then, like this is an old newsreel, even when like right after it happened, it was being ignored.

00:30:29
iHeart Intro: Yeah, like yeah, that's really hard to believe, but also easy to believe in some ways, sadly, So these days you can you can still go over to one on one Taylor Street. That building is still there. It is obviously not the restaurant any longer. It is still a home for many trans people, and the tenderloin itself is still still has that sort of that sort of spirit and undercurrent there people are. You know, it's sort of how San Francisco is treated. Both this area and this riot is really interesting for a progressive city because they haven't done the right thing in many cases over the years. Some people have tried. In twenty fifteen, there was a developer name called Group I that proposed building a hotel and retail project there with a nonprofit space a couple of blocks away from the location at Compton's, and you know, different people were on board and then like within the gay community and then we're like, no, I don't think we should do this here because it's a historical area and we should just preserve it as that. And I think that's just sort of like a lot of people are fighting back against that in general in San Francisco kind of no matter what the cause.

00:31:47
Josh: Yeah, for sure. So they finally, I guess they went along with it, or it just was going to happen one way or another, but they got some concessions out of the developer and the city, and one of the things that was that came out of it was that the area Taylor Street that Compton's Cafeteria used to be along, they renamed it Gene Compton's Cafeteria Way. And at first everybody was like, Okay, that's a compromise because we wanted it called Compton's Cafeteria Riot I guess way, and the city was like, no, we're not putting Riot on an actual official street sign. So they said, well, we'll call it Gene Compton's Cafeteria Way. And then later on they're like, no, actually, that's a terrible name for it because it commemorates one of the people who was anti trance, who like got us, who kicked us out of his cafeteria routinely. Why would we want to commemorate him. We wanted to commemorate this uprising instead, and they finally changed it to what did they change.

00:32:46
iHeart Intro: It to, Well, they dropped the name Compton's because they didn't want to honor someone who they said, you know, would frequently call the cops on them.

00:32:55
Josh: Right, So, I can't remember what they named it. I think it might be like trans under Corridor Way or something like that. And the reason why is because there's a transgender cultural district there now. And do you remember our colleague, she was a trans woman, Raquel Willis.

00:33:14
iHeart Intro: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:33:15
Josh: I read an article about this new cultural district that she wrote in I Think Out magazine. It's pretty good. That's yeah, it was great too. So it's probably the first transgender cultural district in the entire world, and it's very appropriately in the Tenderloin because this is like kind of like where a lot of the ground zero was for the trans community in America. And this this cultural district has like a I think an entrepreneurial incubator. It helps people looking for housing and jobs. It's it's everything that you would kind of want as a start for a community that's just now starting to have its needs met.

00:33:59
Chuck: That's great.

00:34:00
Josh: I think so too.

00:34:01
iHeart Intro: What if when they when the city said, oh we can't have the name right on a street sign, what if they were like, what about quiet right boulevard on Russian Hill? You're awfully quiet about that one.

00:34:12
Josh: Is there really a quiet right boulevard? I got you for okay, and the fact that you placed it in Russian Hill is what got me. That was well done. Oh, thank you, very well done.

00:34:22
iHeart Intro: All right?

00:34:24
Josh: Okay, Well, if you want to know more about the Comptence CAF tier, you're right. Definitely go watch Screaming Queens and go listen to that episode of Unsung History. And thanks a lot, Gigi for the idea, great one, And since I thank gg, that means it's time for listener mail.

00:34:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and you know that makes the overall gullible score Josh four hundred and sixty three. Chuck one.

00:34:49
Josh: Hey, at least it's not a big goose egg for you.

00:34:52
iHeart Intro: I got points on the board.

00:34:54
Josh: That was a sports metaphor, right.

00:34:57
iHeart Intro: That's right, followed by a following a quiet riot shout, which is probably not something you expected to hear in this podcast.

00:35:05
Josh: No, but they hold up.

00:35:07
iHeart Intro: All right, I'm gonna call this Handburger. Then, quite frankly, the only reason I'm reading it is because of that word, because I think it's hysterical what this guy says. This from Danny. Hey, guys, just finish to the latest episode, and the listener mail Sam mentioned he was hesitant to try the show because the title of the show sounded condescending, as if it was suggesting that he should already know certain things at this point in his life. I've heard you mention this about other people. It always cracks me up, because that's exactly why I started listening. It started about seven years ago. The person I was dating at the time would constantly hooke fun and belittle me for not knowing certain things. So one day I, huh, that's abuse. It is abuse. So one day I literally typed stuff you should know into Google, hoping to find a list of things that I ought to know. Awesome, true story is what this guy says. What I found instead, Thank God, was your show. Admittedly, it took me a while to realize you two weren't simply performing a public service to the world informing idiot boyfriends of their obvious knowledge gaps and remedying the situation. It probably wasn't until the Jackhammer's episode that I asked myself, should I really know this?

00:36:13
Josh: That's an abuse too?

00:36:15
iHeart Intro: That it's Danny. Uh. This is the best part though, needless to say, but I'm gonna say it anyways. The relationship did not work out. What I learned, though, is that everyone has some knowledge gaps. So what if I thought it was a handburger rather than a hamburger.

00:36:29
Josh: I think that's important.

00:36:31
iHeart Intro: There's no ham and you eat it with your hands. That's what Danny says.

00:36:34
Josh: It makes sense, but everyone else calls it a hamburger so or a steam tam is steamedam right?

00:36:42
iHeart Intro: I'm only going to call them handburgers from now on, though.

00:36:45
Josh: Yeah, because it makes a really love peace for why you would call it a handburger.

00:36:50
iHeart Intro: Or that I didn't know IV stood for intravenous? What am I a doctor who gives a rip?

00:36:56
Josh: I like Danny.

00:36:58
iHeart Intro: All that to say, thanks for doing what you do, guys, for teaching me stuff I want to know, as well as some things I probably should know. Keep it up until the bitter end, Danny.

00:37:05
Josh: Thanks a lot, Danny, that was an excellent email and we're glad that you're on board.

00:37:10
iHeart Intro: I wonder what Danny thought i'veys did for I don't know, or if it was like ivy or something. Right, He's like four, like, why are you gonna put ivy in my arm?

00:37:20
Josh: Uh? Where was I? Oh? Yeah? If you want to be like Danny and send us a rock and email, we would love to hear from you, wrap it up, spank it on the bottom, send it off to stuff podcast at iHeartRadio dot com.
