Josh: Hello, everybody. It's your old pals Josh and Chuck, and you will have the chance to see us live in person for the first time in two years, Friday, January twenty one in San Francisco. Right, Chuck, that's right, we're returning to the stage at Sketch Fest. We're very excited about it. We can't wait to see everyone. It is a VACS only show. Bring your backscard. It is a mask only show. Bring that mask. Can't wait to see a third of your faces. That's right. You can get tickets at s F sketch Fest dot com and again Friday, January one, thirty pm Sydney Goldstein Theater in San Francisco, California. We will see you there. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and there's Charles w Chuck Chuck, Chuck A Luck Bryant. This is gonna be a good one. I can tell by your nickname, Chuck. And this is Stuff you should know the podcast the podcast. Oh nice? Was that off the cuff? Do you have a written on your nose? It was off the cuff And that's probably about as funny as this one's gonna get. There's not a lot of room for jokes in here. But but Chuck, this is the topic that I didn't know. I wanted to know more about. Oh really, I had no idea when you when you when you threw out palm trees palms, I genuinely was puzzled. I'm like, I have to know what what triggered that, because it's not something that you're walking around. I live around palm trees all the time. They're all over the place and I've never stopped and being like, we should do an episode on palm trees. So what what caused that? Uh? I thought I told you no. No. So then this is very true is I went to Los Angeles to go to a sales dinner, as you know. Uh, and so they were bringing a bunch of new sales people on board at my heart, and they had a dinner because they had not met in person, and they said, hey, let's get uh, let's get Chuck out here, because you know, Josh didn't want to go. Somebody said, what about Jostin, like just just just chuck believe it. No. I think they just didn't bother because you would have been like, are you serious, uh, just to come say hi and stuff. And we were, you know, the sales people were picking my brain and being inquisitive and saying, how do you get your topics? How do you get your topics? And I literally I said, you know, you just look at the world around you and they come to you. And I looked outside in Santa Monica and it said, like palm Trees, that could be an episode, and they said, make it an episode. There's a great ad sales impression, by the way, No, none of them talking like that. In fact, it's quite opposite. Ad sales people are very smooth. Oh I'm guessing. So yeah, I mean they saw ads for Pete's sake. Yeah, so they just said wow, really and I said yeah, and in fact, I will do it, and I will dedicate this episode to ad sales. That's awesome. This is the episode that everybody wants to hear. The episode on Palm Trees dedicated to ad sales. That's right. Well, no, they do a great job and they keep the show nice and free for everybody. Oh that's right, man, that is right. So hats off to the ad sales people. This one's for you, guys. But that is how it came about. It's just sort of an example of you just sort of look around sometimes. And I lived in l A for quite a few years, as you know, and I loved palm trees. I have a palm tree in my backyard. And I was like, wait a minute, there's a lot of different kinds and I wish I knew more about them. And now I have a very uh unfun podcast episode to do. I don't know, it's fun and that it's super science. And there's a lot too. There's a lot of stuff that most people don't know, and we're gonna impart it to them in a approachable manner. Okay, Yeah, it wasn't as like exciting as I thought. Afterward, I was kind of okay, well, you know what about poor Dave Rugs, who helped us out with this one. I think Dave enjoys the stuff. Okay, I hope. So so we're talking palm trees, Charles, and did you know this, let's start with this. There are more than twenty different species of palm trees. Did you know that when you were wandering around l A. No, I knew there were quite a few, but I thought, you know, dozens. Okay, sit there, please continue to sit. Mhm. Did you know that palm trees are in no way, shape or form? Actually, I should take that back. They are not actually trees as far as botanists are concerned. I definitely did not know that. Very nice. And then lastly, Chuck, well, let's say it. Really, those are the two big crazy facts. Palm trees are not trees. And that's a big one because if you look at a palm tree, you say, no, it's a tree. It's got bark, it's very tall, has leaves kind of branch out from it. It's a it's a treat. Don't be ridiculous. And um, again to a botanist, it's not a tree. And we're going to get very very detailed into why it's not actually a tree. Um. But it helps if you to to understand this, if you just step back and look at a palm tree, even the tallest, biggest palm trees, those ones along Hollywood Boulevard in that Morrissey video. Um that those are giant plants and those aren't trunks, those are stems. Yeah, that's that is pretty cool. And a botanist will sell you that a uh, someone else not as hung up on the botany might say, well, you know what, they function as trees though, smarty, So take that fact and and stick it where the sun don't shine. And then that's kind of the end of that conversation because they just got hostile. Well no, somebody comes in and says, peas, peas children. Let's put it like this. Both palms are upright, tree form plants, and everyone says, thank you, Happy International Tolerance Day, everybody. That's right. But palms are closer categorically speaking to grasses and grains like something like corn, than it is that mighty oak. So again, it's just a tall, giant plant, not a tree, a plant, And in fact, giant is a really good way to put it, because a lot of the growth patterns that um palms undertake are are a form of gigantism. They're like plants on steroids basically. So there you go. That's a good that's some good groundwork for the whole thing. If you ask me, I think so, Uh, maybe we could start at angiosperms. Uh, there are about three hundred thousand of those bad boys, and these are flowering plants, and I think a lot of this stuff people. It may ring a bell to like high school biology, because when I was going through it, I was like, wait a minute, I learned about this many many years ago. Uh, and it's all kind of coming back to me. But um angie sperms of those flowering plants that have the seeds in case in the fruit, and it's the largest group in the plant kingdom. And within that you've got monocots and die cots, and palms are monocots. And that's important because I mean, you can't talk about palm trees without talking about the specificity of like how they grow and how they how they operate. Yeah, because they're in in those details lies why they're not trees, why there's something else while they're basically gigantic plants. So you said, palm trees are monocots. Die cots are what we're used to when we look at a tree. Things like elm trees, beach um, uh maple trees, all of those are die cots, right. Um. And when you're looking at like a pine tree or an evergreen, usually that's a gymnasperm that's like a completely different kind of uh plant altogether. It doesn't have its um seeds and a fruit. It bears its seeds on like the outside of like a cone or something totally different thing. We don't need to talk about gymnasperms again. Instead, we're talking about monicots and dicotts, both angiosperms. Right. Uh. And if you've ever planted a little die coot seedling, the first thing you're gonna notice when it when it pops up out of the ground is you're gonna have to I think it's called caddleadn. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, And you're gonna see two of those, and it's very you know, that's why it's called a die coot because there's two. A monica like a palm, will only have one. Yeah, And caddleadn is just the first leaves that come out of a sprout. And so you've got two, and like you said, with the monicott, you've got one. That's a big difference. But that's surely not a big enough difference to be like, well, palm is not even close to a tree. It's something totally different. You're right, Yeah, it goes on, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. The differences continue. It does. If you look at a dicott leave. If you take like a a maple leaf or an oak tree leaf and you look at the back of it or at the front, but can really get a good look at the back or hold it up in the sun, you'll see the little weblike pattern of veins coming off from that central stem on a leaf. That's different on a di coot, on a monocot, it does not do that. They they run parallel. Veins do from stiff from like rear to tip. That's your vein right there, just a tip. There's also um. Die coots have something called a cambium layer. And this is uh, this is really important to me. This is the big differentiator between palm tree and a die coott tree like a maple tree. Right, This is the big difference is that palm trees don't make wood and die cott trees like a maple tree does. And it does that because it has what's called secondary growth where it has a bunch of cells xylem and flow them cells which are vascular tissues, and they line up in a circle and they form a ring in this nice tight pattern and they grow outward and outward and outward. It every year, so that if you cut a tree down and look at the stump that's left. You see rings, and those rings are annual growth of spring would in autumn wood. But the upshot is is it's actually growing would every year. As the tree grows outward, it gains girth, and that is secondary growth. And the big distinction between monocots and i coots is that monocots don't have secondary growth. They don't grow like that. They don't grow outward, they grow upward. That's a huge distinction. Yeah, and this is where you know it can get a little word parsi um. Monocots generally do not have secondary growth. Palm trees do have a kind of secondary growth, but it's not real secondary growth. I think it's what's the what's the word for it? Uh, anomalous secondary growth is that the one? Yeah, anomalous secondary growth. So, like every plan has primary growth. If you go and you shouldn't do this because it's bad for the tree. But if you went and carved your name into a mighty oak, that that's not gonna grow up, that's not gonna be ten feet above your head in thirty years because that tree is going outward. A palm tree like you said, it grows from the top. So when you see a palm, you're gonna generally see those palm fronds sticking out of the top of it. And if you say, yeah, but there's some underneath it too, those are just fronts that haven't fallen off yet on the way up right exactly. So another way to put it is that palm trees grow up. They don't grow out right, but they do have girth yea in some cases, I know, girth just the tip growing would good lord, oh man, the ad sales people are blushing. Who saw this coming? So, yeah, they do have girth, um, but they have girth for a totally different reason. And and like, yeah, you can look at a palm tree and be like, yeah, it's a huge, it's thick, it's that's a trunk. But some of them are really too. Yeah. I think the biggest one gets to like three feet in diameter. That's a big old trunk. But the thing is, if you cut a palm tree down and you look down inside of it, you're not gonna see neat pattern of tight rings of those axylum and flow them cells. They do have xylum and flow them cells because those are um vascular cells. They carry water, minerals, sugars throughout the plant. So all all plants and trees have xylum and flow them cells. But in a in a a monocot, like a palm tree, they grow just kind of willy nilly, and they grow upward. What gives the palm tree it's girth is when those vascular cells themselves grow in size. So you've got more vascular cells growing up through the plant, through the stem of the plant, which you think is a trunk. You have more of them, and then they increase in size. That actually increases the girth of the stem. But the stem itself is not growing outward. It's not laying, it's not adding layers of growth outward because that would be secondary growth, and and monocott ston't engage in secondary growth. That's right. And the other really cool thing about a palm is is and one of the things that uh separates monocots from di coots is that monocots don't have that central tap root. So if you, uh, if a storm came along and pulled up a palm tree, you would see where basically where the mom is about to call it a trunk. Uh, we'll probably call it a trunk here and there, but it is a stem where the stem meets the ground. If it's uprooted, you'll just see just a spider web of smaller roots. It doesn't have this big, one central tap root from which the other roots go. It comes straight from the base of that stem. That's right, And those are called um. I think we'll get into a little bit later, but it's called and votitious root growth, right, Yeah, which is not super deep. I think the deepest you're gonna find is maybe a few feet. Yeah, but they can really go out, yeah, like fifty feet out from from the trunk in either direction. It's um. It's really something to see. But the problem is that that also makes them often susceptible to being blown over in hurricanes because they often grow along the coast. Yeah, and if you if it's a shallow grounded area, you can a lot of times you can see a lot of that root system sort of sitting level with the ground. It's neat in some kinds, I think, including um king palms, maybe royal palms that are nice. They look like big fat cigars growing out of the bottom of the of the tree at the base. It's pretty cool looking. Take a break. Oh man, you just you took the words right out of my mouth. I think that's a good Uh, it's a good teaser for the first part. Yeah, I say we take a break and let the ad sales people do their thing. Are they going to read the ads? We'll find out, Okay, okay, Chuck. So it turns out the ad salespeople did not read the ads, but they did sell them and appreciate one for that. So, um palms are actually super duper old. Some of the oldest plant fossils we've turned up, and by we, I mean you and me specifically our palm um fraunds that are upwards of seventy million years old um. But they think that they're actually much older than that, because there's a theory that palms are found all over the world because they were growing on m Gondwana, which is part of a super continent after Pangia started to break up. Gondwana was one of the big massive pieces of of um Earth that started to break up between hundred and eighty and a hundred forty five million years ago, and they think the palms were like goodbye family, goodbye. As the as the land spread out informed the continence as we know them today, and then started to do all sorts of weird stuff as they evolved in isolation from one another. That's right, uh, and weird stuff meaning there can be tiny palms that are about you know, five to eight inches tall. There is and I encourage people to safely look up some of these because it is pretty amazing to see the variety. Like when you look up the wax palm. Uh, these are the ones I think generally found in South America that are so tall and skinny. I mean, you think the one some of those in l A are tall and skinny, nothing compared to these wax palms where you look at them and they just seem to sort of defy gravity, and you wonder, how are they not just snapping in a half constantly with wind. It's uh um, anomalous secondary growth, that's the answer. But those wax palms grow in the mountains in the andies. So if you climbed up one of them, I think they're up up to two feet tall, which is what about seventy meters tall um, and you fell off the top, it get even worse because you'd also be falling off a mountain, so you don't want to climb a wax palm unless you're just a dummy. That's right. Uh, those stems that we talked about, the what most people might call a trunk, Like we said earlier, they do very wildly. Some of them are very small, just a few millimeters, and then those, you know, I have different kinds that are my favorites. But one of my favorites of those really big thick stemmed ones that are sort of load to the ground, very big around and have a big um just sort of almost like a fireworks display of blooms like a palmetto. Now not a palmetto palmettos. I don't think you can really see the trunk very much, can you. I saw palmetto? I think yeah. I think they get tall after a while, they stay short and then and then they achieve the correct girth and then they grow longer. But I mean, there's twenty so I'm sure there is a variety of something to suit your fancy, you know what I mean. Yeah, that's exactly right. And that one that grows only to be five inches tall and has a stemmed just a few millimeters thick, that one's called dipsis minuda um and it's pretty cut. That was not planned by the Really, Yeah, I don't buy that. I swear I will, I will photo copy. I'll scan this page and send it to you and you will not see it on there. Well, that's because you mean is standing with a big Q card in front of you, right, That's how I could get away with this, but you figured me out. I can't. I think the one that we have in our backyard is um a windmill palm, and we planted it when we first got to Atlanta. Emily worked as a producer on a TV commercial and sometimes you might have noticed this a little bit with the TV show. Sometimes there's things that you get for a TV show or commercial or a movie that you can't return or do anything with, and so at the end of the job they'll be like, who wants this whatever that we can't do anything with? And Emily said, oh, we would love that palm tree. Uh. And it was kind of small, and we planted it here in Atlanta and it is really flourished. They are very easy to take care of. You don't really don't do anything and they have managed to uh. And this is kind of one of the points of how robust they can be even though they generally grow in the tropical areas around the world. Uh, you know, this thing has had plenty of snow on it and plenty of hard freezes in Atlanta over the years, and it's just as healthy as can be. Yeah. Now, there's some palms that can thrive in zone five B I saw, which is like South Nebraska and South Iowa. The needle palm does just fine there. So Jersey short palms that said, yeah it has like, um, like bleached orange spikes rather than green fronds. That wasn't written down either. I like that one. Um. But yeah, it's just like plus species, they're gonna learn to adapt everywhere. And they've been around for hundreds of millions of years, so they've actually gotten pretty good at doing things like putting up with snow, which is surprising because again you kind of associate the palms with like a tropical rainforest, and for good reason, because they are found a lot in tropical rainforests all throughout around you know, right above and below the equator around the world. Um. Apparently in the Amazon they make up six of all the trees that you'll find there, so they're pretty successful as far as um as far as plants go, gigantic plants, that's right. Uh. Should we talk a little bit about what what makes up a palm tree? We've talked a little bit about it. You know, there are those roots that extend way way out in a pretty shallow manner. Uh, there is that elongated stem. And one thing you'll notice when you're looking at a palm stem or if you want to go up and hug one of those guys, is sometimes you might get hurt. Uh. It is it doesn't have bark, it has the scars of of fronds it came before. And depending on what kind of tree that is, it could be it can be kind of smooth, but usually they're kind of rough, and sometimes they're they're really rough and kind of uh pointing and spiky. Yeah, for sure, Um, I think people kind of trim those kind back a little bit. But um, I've all I was also reading about over trimming them that you don't really want to. Um, you don't want to trim them too much, and you definitely don't want to trim any kind of palm frond that isn't totally brown and crusty, musty, because if it's not even if it's yellow, that means that there's still a bunch of nutrient stores in there, just hanging out, and the palm is like, hey, you just used up. You just took a lot of my energy away. So um, you want them typically either fall off naturally like they do, or wait until they're just so brown and desiccated that that even you can tell this this palm front can be taken off without hurting the tree. But um, it's pretty obvious. It is pretty obvious. But I thought was really interesting is is um the idea that that's that's not bark. Those are just like leaf remains, the remains of basically where the leaf hit the tree at one time. And it looks if you if you look, Dave points us out, and I never really put it into words before, but it's exactly true. It looks like the palm fronds have been moving down the base of the tree, forming this trunk all the way down, or forming the bark all the way down. But really the stem has been growing up and out of each leaf scar that's left behind that forms what looks like the bark. So it's almost like an optical illusion of palm tree. Yes, yeah, I kind of get what he's saying there, Like, have you ever have you ever driven next to a car and the wheels are spinning so fast that they start to look like they're they're spinning backwards much more slowly. Yeah, I think it's akin to that. Do you know what I thought you were gonna say? Is that thing where you where the car next to you you see out of your peripheral vision starts to move and you think you're rolling forward and drink out a little bit and go, oh my god. Yeah, that's even better. I like that one even more. But it has nothing to do with palm trees. No, it does, because they're all optical illusions. Okay, okay, um. Should we talk a bit about Well, we talked about how they grow. They grow from the top. When those when those leaves pop out of the top, it's it's called a spear and it pops out of what's called the apical meristem or the apical meristem, And that's the thing that's uh, you know, if a tree, if it were a di coot, that's where the wood would be growing from. But it's not. It depends so so they both have apical maris stems from what I can tell, But the tree has a lateral maristem as well, and that's where that girth around the sides grows to make it wider, the witty girth. But the thing another thing that differentiates UM. Another thing that differentiates the palm tree from a diet tree is that a die cout tree has a bunch of different places where it has an apical maris stem, and those we call branches the place where branches grow off. So an apical meristem is wherever primary growth, which is upright UM vertical growth of a plant comes from, Like a maple tree has a bunch of them. Those are the branches and then eventually like smaller branches and even into the leaves. That's all apical meristem growth. A palm tree has one place aside from the roots, one place on the entire plant where it is growing. Everything else is already grown gone left a scar behind um them or it even looks like it's growing, but it's it's already grown, and it's just sitting there photosynthesizing like a big old palm front. But right in the middle of the top of the plant is the apical meristem, and that's where those new leaves shoot up from, and that's where the xylem and flow divide and growth occurs. And that's it. There's the one spot, and that's it for the palm. Yeah. And if you if you have a palm near you and it's low enough to see the top of it pretty well, you will see many times among all those beautiful green fronds um sometimes like big windmill fans, you'll see that little spiky thing sticking kind of straight up, and that's called the spear, and it will unfold into the frond and it will it will become a beautiful front. At one point it's almost like ah, so it's almost like a caterpillar becoming a beautiful butterfly, except as a leaf. Except as a leaf. And if you've ever seen the palms that have you know, we we talked about the stem, how it's just sort of that rough scar all the way up. Sometimes you'll see him that have a really smooth green part that kind of looks like uh. And we'll get to coconuts kind of looks like the very outside of a big coconut. That's called the crown shaft. The king palm is famous for these, and that's that little smooth green section between where the trunk is rough and where the leaves pop out of the top right, and all those are are the like layered leaves folded around the top of the stem. And as they as those leaves unfold and become fronds and hang out and photosynthesize, and then the energy stores that they have is used up and they fall off. Those kinds of palms, they fall off very cleanly, so compared to other rougher um rougher exterior palms, like a king palm is very smooth, even below the crown shaft where it's kind of gray and layered in horizontal stripes. That's but those are still scars left from the leaves that used to be attached there, that unfolded at the crown shaft and grew and lived and died and then fell off. There's so many weird sexual innuendos with palm trees. I had no idea, no idea. It explains a lot about how I felt about palm trees for a long time. I had no idea. It probably doesn't hurt that we're twelve years old, because there are plenty people out there, like, what have they been talking about? Yeah, that's true. Those are eight years old. Uh. So let's talk about these palm fronds or the palm leaves. Uh. There are a few different kind of shapes they can take. Uh, there's the feather like pinnate. Uh. If you see a coconut palm, this is what you're gonna see as a couple of rows of those of those leafs kind of sprawling out from that central rib down the middle. That rib is called a ratcheus, and where it meets and this is a lot of sort of you know, technical talk here, but the thick part where it actually meets the trunk, that's called the petiole. Yeah, where the rat ratchetus meets the trunk, right, that's right. And then those leaves are all individual. They're just connected. The only place where they join is that that rack is at the central rib um. But other than that, they're not connected, which makes them different from a palmate um type of half. Those are good. Those are those are really good. I think palmate might be my favorite. Where they're there, they seemed disconnected, but if you follow them back to their terminal point where they connect to the branch. You'll see that they're all connected at one central point and they're kind of fanned out almost in a circle or semicircle, radiating away from that one central point where they're all connected. Um, and that's that central point is called the hastula. So that's palmate. That's another good one. And there's cost to palmate, right, Yeah, the cost of poll made is a little bit of both. If you like a little pinnate, you like a little palm mate, then you get your cost to palm mate. That is the fan shape as well, and it is attached to a central rib called a costa, and that it's extends from that pettiole into that leaf blade. Uh. You know when it's it's interesting when these things fall off, those those fan shaped ones and you gather them off the ground, you really get a sense of their potential uses, which you know, we'll talk about that stuff a little bit later, but like primitive uses as a fan or as a broom or you know, they're all kinds of things. Things. When you have a big handful of those those dead palm fronds, you can see even you know here in modern times, like I could see how this could be useful. Yeah, just think about how much thought the writers of Gilligan's Island put into that. Yeah right, I can't watch that show anymore. How about you. I haven't tried in a long time. Why why not? I think it's just rain its course in my brain. It was great when I was, you know, a younger person. Now I'm like, this is I can't watch this. Yeah. I had a recurring dream when I was a kid. The first recurring dream I remember had to do with Gilligan's Island. But it was scary, like the boat was washed ashore on the beach, and I remember I was in the back kind of hiding, uh from somebody who was trying to get me or something. But I had that dream over and over for a while. So wait a minute, somebody was trying to get you while you were in the ship that was being shipwrecked. No, it had already been shipwrecked, and it was just like, you know, a shipwrecked boat on shore that I was hiding and like behind the back seat, did you ever figure out who it was? No? You know, I don't think I've ever had a recurring dream. All of my dreams are all original material. Every time Huh, that's interesting. I think so too. Did you have imaginary friends? No? No, no, they seem silly and superfluous to me. Someone just the only reason I've thought of that is because someone sent that in as a as a request and saying that imaginary friends is a sign of later successes in various ways supposedly. Well, that explains a lot as well. But look at you now. I don't know, but think about how successful I could be if I had had imaginary friends. I could be president of the world. My daughter has what she calls ghost friends and always has and now ghost parents, and we wonder sometimes if that is something to do with being adopted, oh yeah, or if it's just the regular imaginary friend thing with kids, or your house is haunted and she can see things you can't, or that that's number three be pretty awesome. I mean she's spelling it out for you. Chalk right there. All right? Should we take another break? Sure? All right, we'll talk about those uh not so beautiful palm flowers right after this. All right, If you've ever walked past the palm tree and you've seen a what looks like a blob of yellow or orange, orange is a big one. Yeah, I mean, what do they even look like? They look like just a little tiny grape bunches, but but not really. They're not very attractive to me, But I guess beauties in the eye the beholder. Those are palm, the flower of the palm tree. So one thing I have to say, though, is, Chuck you you would probably have your eyes open if you spend a little time on Google images looking at different palm inflorescences. Some of them are okay, yeah, there's some that are just straight up dazzling. I saw one that was like a nice pink and it looks like a really tight like you now, sometimes people have like dreadlocks that are have been around so long they actually merged into one big dread It looks like that, but like a pinkish purple, yes, but a hot pinkish purple version of that. It's very pretty. Um And again, there's like twenty undred or more species of palm, so there's a lot of different variety. But that said, I agree with you, most of the palm inflorences inflorenceances I've ever seen, or not pretty at all. I think what my problem is is I feel like it disturbs even the pretty ones that it doesn't jibe with the rest of the look. Yeah, so it looks like like a really attractive person wearing maybe a really nice hat, but that doesn't go with the rest of the outfit. Okay, all right, I totally get your meaning, and I think you nailed it. It just doesn't seem to fit in. But you keep calling them inflorescences instead of flowers. What do you mean by that? Well, I mean inflorescence is just another name for a palm flower, and palm is a It's an antio sperm, which is by definition, a flowering plant. It just doesn't look like what you and I would think of as flowers, but that's exactly what it is. And with the palm, from what I can tell, everything is a frond. It's some sort some version of a frond, and the inflorescence is no no exception. It's a specialized, weirdo version of the of the palm frond that grows out and depending on the kind of palm, it's going to have either male flowers, female flowers, or it's going to have male and female flowers in which cases off pollinating. And the upshide of all this is is when the female flowers get pollinated, they will produce fruit. And because we're talking abouferent species of palms, you get a lot of different kinds of fruit that come along. Yeah, it's it's pretty interesting actually, Like if you look at your standard coconut palm that has both the male and female parts, so that makes it monoecious. Uh, this is stuff that we learned in high school biology. Again, I haven't seen that word in so long, I know, I even was calling it monoecious for a while. I was like, I, No, that's not right, that's what I was remember. No, it's monoecious and dioecious. Those ohs are silent and dioecious. Palms only have male flowers or female flowers. Uh. And like you said, depending on the fruit. You know, if you're if you're a coconut palm, uh, then you're gonna have both, but you gotta fertilize that that female flower. If you're a date palm, uh, it's dioecious, so you can only harvest from the l tree. But you need to have both again to fertilize and get that delicious bad date. But that is dates are actually a fruit from palms from appropriately enough date palms. I didn't know that. I didn't either, and dates are delicious in this um. Researching this made me want this. But I if I had to choose, I'm a fig person for sure. Or figs from a palm? No, no, big tree. Yeah, but there's like, you know, dried fruit dates and figs. They're so they're so you know, uh, they seem to go hand in hand. So I don't think you have to choose, which is is just a stupid thing to even bring up. I'm sorry I did well. I don't know that I've ever had. In fact, I can almost say certainly I've never had a fresh date, like right off of a tree. You mean, yeah, like that, you know, not dried and not like raisins or fig style, but like in the Raider's Lost Ark, the bad date. Those are bad dates, bad dates. It's right that poor monkey, I mean, it was an evil monkey, but I think he was trained to be evil. Oh you think with the Nazi salute? Yes, I don't think he was born knowing how to do that. I think he was trained to do that and it made him a bad, bad monkey. But I still don't think he deserved to be poisoned by bad dates. You know that movie is uh has been under fire in recent years because of the the nature of India's relationship with Marilyn Marian and how old she was. Oh yeah, and he's also like fairly rough with her as well. Yeah, but there's this there's those lines at the beginning where he talks about you know, you know what you were doing, you know, I was a child or whatever. And I think for many years everyone's just like, yeah, whatever, and then someone's like, wait a minute, how much of a child was she? And I think people have tried to do the math over the years to work it out so with the time period where it wasn't that bad. But I do know that in discussion this something I talked on movie Crush a little bit about. But Lucas and Spielberg, when they were discussing it all at the beginning, one of them was pushing at the time for him to make it like creepy, Like no, man, let's make it really young and make it really kind of a bad thing that he did. Was that George Lucas doing that? I think it might have been. I don't know. I should look all the stuff up so I'm not you know, I'm glad. Spielberg was like, yeah, yeah, great idea, A great idea. We'll definitely will workshop that later. Uh. Anyway, bad dates, bad dates, and um dates. By the way, Chuck, are droops, as are all palm fruits. Did you know that? I didn't know that, but I did know that they were similar to peaches and olives, and say, what peaches and cream? Yeah, peaches and cream. And in the way that they they had that hard outer that kind of stony like covering around the seed, right, but they're usually also covered with some sort of flesh that we like to eat. Um, that's not always the case. So I think coconuts are the reverse of that. So like, if you're eating like a peach, the seed itself is that hard is inside the hard pit in the fruit. The coconut seed. No, a coconut is the opposite of that. It's got that hard, woody outer shell you can knock, knock, knock on, just and have some fun with before you It's exactly right, Chuck, nice Um that you're m actually knows that's the endocarp the hardest part that you knock on the carpet. You're talking about the hard green outer most layer. No, that would be the exocarp. The endocarp is the hard brown, woody one that that you can knock on and then you can use as a bowling ball island exactly or like a tiki cocktail cup all again on Killick's island. Um. And uh, it's the stuff inside that that's the actual seed, and that's what we eat in the coconut, the the endosperm and the liquid endosperm um, the stuff you eat from a coconut, that's actually the seed that you're eating where it's like a peach, you're eating the outside of the meat that's outside of the of the seed, right, And that indo sperm is the the solid part is that flesh, that white, delicious nous coconut. And then the coconut water is the liquid into sperm. So if you next time your friend is having a coconut water, to sco up to them and say, entroy the liquid indo sperm and they'll say, what are you talking about? You can't say stuff like that. They'll do a spit take. I hope not. Because that coconut water is delicious, it is and expensive too. And if you're like, well, wait a minute, I thought coconut water was coconut milk. You are wrong, wrong, wrong. Coconut milk is taking coconut meat, grating it up into a paste and then adding water to that. That that's coconut milk. That's delicious too, it is, it's super high. In fact, if they're really healthy fats, understand, that's a good fat and it um. I'm not a big sort of Caribbean drink cocked guy. But oh you don't like the tinky drinks. No, I'm not really into them, just a little too sweet. I mean maybe one of them, but uh, they're a little sweet for me. But that that coconut milk man with some with some rum is a really nice combination. You know, people have been drinking that for eons for good reason. They sure have. You know what else they've been drinking even longer than that, chuck a little something called palm wine. Oh yeah, so I didn't know that this existed, but it sounds awesome. But you're there are a lot of different kinds of palm species that you can tap, including I think coca yeah, coconut palms and date palms and the Chilean wine palm, which they're like, well, yeah, of course, but you can tap the sap of these things and what comes out contacts the air and just a little bit amount of like microbes in the air that come in contact with the stuff immediately cause it to start to ferment, and within hours it has gone from palm sap to an alcoholic beverage. And then hours after that, within about a day or so of it being tapped, it turns into vinegar. So you have to drink this stuff which turns into like a four percent alcoholic drink just by sitting out in the air a few hours after it's tapped, within a day of tapping it, yeah, which is why it is one of the oldest boozes because you could get it quickly and pretty naturally, you didn't have to do anything for And apparently they've caught monkeys actually drinking it too. Oh yeah, yeah, like it. They I think they found evidence that of humans drinking it as far back as eighteen thousand years ago. It's a very long time um and that because they've caught um like primates other primates drinking it's possible that it goes even further back in our evolutionary history. Very interesting. I thought so too. There's also palm oil, uh that is in food products, It's in a lot of um skin products. It is uh sort of an environmental disaster these days. There are plantations in Indonesia Malaysia where basically you just clear cut forest to plant more palms to get palm oil. And getting um quote unquote sustainably sourced palm oil is difficult, too impossible for your products. Uh. There are some people that say there is no such thing and that if it's something is labeled officially sustainable, They're like, well, no, just go back fifteen or twenty years and there was once natural forest growth there too. So it's kind of a meaningless title when just a handful of years have to go by before you say, oh no, no, no, this this palm field was here already. Like from what I understand, this is just not the case. Yeah. That was one of those things where I looked into I was like, oh good, another reason to to um be pessimistic and loose hope. There's the akai those little kai berries. I didn't know they came from palms? Is it a kaya tho asi? I've always said a kai, but it's probably a sid never said it out loud. So there it's like supposed to be a super food rich in antioxidants, and I was like, that rings a bell. We did an episode in anti oxidants, did we did? We surmise that it's BS And I went back and I read a transcript of it and um, it may bee So take that however you like. But it definitely does have all sorts of antioxidants, including antho cyanins, because that's where it has its purple color from the s E does Okay, is it really a sai? I feel foolish as I've never heard it said. Well, now you have from your good pal Josh. I don't think I've ever said it out loud until now in front of millions of you. Are right, So it's no biggie. You've got the hearts of palm, of course, that you'll find usually in a can on a shelf in your grocery store. Is that's the apical Maris stem chuck. That is it's just about to say that, and it is right there at the core. You get them in Hawaii and Costa Rica or places in South America, and you chopped that thing down and it's got that little, that little tender core. And the reason it's usually in a canus because it's doesn't last very long. Yes, uh so it's pickled typically, right yeah? Um? What about battle nuts? Did you know about those before? Because I had heard of them, but I had no idea what the video was. I knew. I knew about them because I know that chewing them, which is popular in certain Asian countries, is can be really bad for you. It can make your teeth like red and black and give you cancer. But it's a stimulant, right, Yeah, it gives you a pretty good butt, so it all works out in the end, does it really? Something like of the people in the world chew battle nuts and that makes it the fourth most used um psychoactive um material I guess or substance after um nicotine, caffeine, alcohol and then battle nuts. What about rich hand If you've ever been to peer one import since sat in a in a wicker one? Are those things called the big bowl? Oh papasan chick papasan that is made from palm ritan, uh, from Ritan palms, and it's very hardy. And you know how I mentioned that those fronds are very useful, Like this is the stuff over the years that they use faun fronds for for rooftops and ratan to make really strong furniture, very useful. Yeah, I had no idea, but ratan has really wicked mean barbs and thorns sticking off of it because it uses it to climb up other trees. Um and the stem is really pliable. It's not you know, upright, but it grows vertically, but it's like a vine. And apparently the stem can get up to like five feet long. It's a lot of it's a lot of pure one wicker, a lot of wicker. What was the name of that chair? Do you remember the chair that they would sit in for prom pictures in the seventies, the eyes a case like Moses, Yes, yeah, exactly. I don't know. There's a throne, sort of throne. That's exactly right. That's a chair too. So I guess we should finish up with a couple of little fun facts. One of them. Dave included a few of these. The double coconut palm has uh. I don't know if it's the largest seed. Is it the largest one in the world? Yes? Okay, A mature coconut from that double coconut palm can weigh about ninety pounds and the seed inside is about fifty five. And Dave said, uh, something about the way they look I can't remember exactly how he put it, suggestive, suggestive. And I looked it up and it looks like a butt. Oh, that's not what it suggested to me. I thought it looked like a butt in an an anus. Did you think it looks like female parts? No, just but just come around to the other side of a dude. You thought it looked like a scrotal sack. Yes, yeah, well put I thought it looked like a button, a butt hole. No, it looked like I mean, I could see how you would think that, But it looked like a scrotal sac to me. I thought that was the avocado. That's that's what. Yeah, for sure, avocado has got it going on too. I've got one more fact? What else? What else do you have? Nothing? I want to hear your last fact? Well, I think it'd be kind of fun to just talk about what happened in Florida with all those palms. Oh yeah, I'd love to do that. This is a good one. This the reason Florida has so many palms is because of a shipwreck in January of eight seventy eight, the Spanish brigantine that the Providencia crash landed with a bunch of coconuts on board. Yeah, coconuts and a bunch of other stuff. But there were like twenty thousand coconuts, and a guy named William lane Heart who was one of the early pioneers along this this um like um settlers of European descent, i should say, along this stretch of Florida Beach where this this shipwreck happened. I bought the whole um shipwreck and all of its cargo for like twenty dollars and proceeded to try to sell the coconuts for what was it, like two cents each or a half of two and a half cents, and he sold about a thousand but still it's like a couple of hundred bucks. He like, you know, yeah, ten times over. And then he said, I think I'm just gonna plant the rest of these I think it would be easier than trying to drum up a market for these things. And that's it. That's where palm beaches now. Yeah, the all of the coconut um palms that you see, they are not native. They are descended from that original shipwreck cargo of coconuts. Very very cool. It is very cool indeed. And also check they mentioned Henry Flaggler in there is Founding Palm Beach and West Palm Beach and he if college that's right, and Flagler County. He was like an old Ford executive who made his money, uh well from working at Ford early on and then started like a railroad and then started like founded Palm Beach and was just fabulously wealthy. But um, you know, I know we've talked about going to Providence, Rhode Island and touring some of those old Gilded Age mansions. He has one in Palm Beach. So if you ever make your way down to Palm Beach, go see the Flaggler House Museum. It's one of the most amazing houses you will ever walk in in your entire life. It's astounding. I will check that out. My uh best friend from high school uh rad the uh map drawer of the cartographer. Yeah, he went to Flagler. So I went to and this was in St. Augustine though, but um, I went to Flagler. A couple of times in St. Augustine is a lovely town. We'll just make your your way a little further south a couple of hours down to Palm Beach and check out Flaglers. I'll do it. Okay. Uh, Well, since Chuck said I'll do it, that means, of course, everybody, it's time for listener mayo. I'm gonna call this Josh and the Simpsons. I'm sure you saw this. I figured we could just answer this on the air because I think I know the answer is worried about this, Hey guys, that we were going to read it. Okay, hey, guys, just listen to the hot Dog episode. I was a little surprised at Josh let the whole episode go by without citing Homer's famous line about hot dogs from the episode where he tries to get into the grease business. Then I realized this is a phenomenon I've noticed several times. Like Josh, I'm a Simpson super fan, so I feel like I have to take issue with everyone who has written in to say you missed this quote or citation. On the contrary, what's happening, I think is Josh's biting his tongue and letting I would guess one to three opportunities passed by for episode because he doesn't want to be known primarily is that Simpson's dork and avoid owing royalties to Matt graining. Josh, please validate my hunch that is from g. You're not holding your tongue, are you. Occasionally I do, actually, very very rarely. I think g is giving me way too much credit. And at the risk of of sounding like a fraudulent Simpsons fan, there are a ton of references that people right in and be like, you walked right past this one, and I'll be like, I don't remember that one at all, or I totally forgot about it. I didn't think about that. But every once in a while I will hold it back because you just have to keep the proportion of Simpson's fandom like at a at a certain threshold. Other than that stuff you should know is like, it's stuff you should know. The Simpsons fans were more well rounded than that. So yes, every once in a while, I do, not three times an episode. No, that's what I'm saying. That's a that's over crediting me for sure. Fantastic. Well, thanks again, Gene. If you want to be like G and ask a question or see if your hunch is confirmed.
