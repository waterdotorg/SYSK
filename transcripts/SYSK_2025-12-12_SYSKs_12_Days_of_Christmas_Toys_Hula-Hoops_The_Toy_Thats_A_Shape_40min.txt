00:00:01
Josh: Okay, it's Joshy again. And up next on our playlist is our episode on hula hoops. This is a stuff you should know classic and hula hoops. For those of you who don't know, were this hoop that you kept going around your waist by making a hula motion. It's one of the more appropriately named toys of all time, and it was a huge craze back in the twentieth century. So get your time machine, leather helmet and goggles on and let's go back to the hula hoop.

00:00:28
Speaker 2: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from HowStuffWorks dot com.

00:00:38
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry over there, and this is Stuff you should know the podcast.

00:00:47
Chuck: How's going It's.

00:00:48
Josh: Fine, great, how's it going with you?

00:00:52
Chuck: Good? Jerry's distracting me a little bit because all I see in my peripheral vision is her practicing her new hula fire dance routine.

00:01:00
Josh: It's pretty dangerous.

00:01:01
Chuck: It's dangerous, but it's it's interesting to see out of the corner of one's eye.

00:01:05
Josh: It really is yes, performance.

00:01:08
Chuck: Art, performance hula art.

00:01:11
Josh: Can you hula hoop. I cannot, sir, I'm too self conscious too.

00:01:15
Chuck: To even try it. Yeah, it's it's a grown man, forty four year old man hula hooping.

00:01:21
Josh: Plus when I do it, like as I rotate my hips, it makes the same rotate my hips. Yeah, it makes the sound of like almost congealed jello, just slopping around in a bowl, you know what I mean. I don't want to make that sound.

00:01:38
Chuck: Yeah, but I did see at a the East Atlanta's Strut Festivals, one of Atlanta's many great neighborhood festivals. I believe the Strut to Me is known for having the better music of most of the festivals. And our buddy Craig Johnson's band played Space Knife, not space Knife, Okay, this one was. I can't remember the name of this band, but that band is no longer. He's got a new band.

00:02:00
Josh: Even that guy is always coming up with new stuff. You can never pin him down. It's too good.

00:02:05
Chuck: You should check out Space Knife though people on the web. Yeah, you can find it. It's good.

00:02:09
Josh: It was in our TV show too.

00:02:10
Chuck: Yeah, that's his alter ego. But anyway, Craig's band was playing and this I was pretty hula naive hoop naive at this point. And a few years ago, and there was this lady doing a hula routine to his band playing and I videoed it. It was so awesome.

00:02:30
Josh: So she was hoop dancing.

00:02:32
Chuck: Hoop dancing, Yeah, like the neck, the arms, the legs, moving around with it, like supremely talented hooper. Yeah.

00:02:41
Josh: If you go onto the web and type in hoop dancing, it's going to bring up some pretty impressive videos.

00:02:46
Chuck: Yeah, and it's quite a workout. I could tell. We'll get to that. But just watching her, I got tired, and so I drank another beer and just listen to music.

00:02:53
Josh: Yeah, and pretended you were hula hooping in your head. Yeah, you're like, I'm so good at this in my head.

00:02:59
Chuck: But I was like, man, that's a thing again. I had no idea, but it's a big thing.

00:03:03
Josh: Yeah, hula hooping.

00:03:04
Chuck: Yeah.

00:03:04
Josh: But it's been around for a while.

00:03:06
Chuck: Yes, it has.

00:03:07
Josh: For example, Chuck, did you know. As Robert points out, Robert Lamb wrote this article from Stuff to Blow your mind. Oh yeah, and he says that the hula hoop has been around in some form or fashion since before most of the world's religions. Wow, that's really saying something.

00:03:24
Chuck: That is saying something. So let's get in the way back machine.

00:03:27
Josh: Oh we're going way back time.

00:03:33
Chuck: Yeah, let's go back to one thousand BC. My friend and we're in Egypt, and they're little children, Egyptian children with dried up grapevines they've made into hoops playing with them.

00:03:44
Josh: And there's some Egyptian who's like, get off of my patch of sand kids. Yeah, you know, instead of a lawn.

00:03:53
Chuck: Sure, I get it. That was good. It was all right. So they they no doubt use them in similar ways that we did today. But they what one thing they did which was a big sporting thing to do for a long time, which I don't get personally. The fun value that is is using a stick to push a hula hoop down the road.

00:04:16
Josh: I think the fun in it is that the hula hoop as it's traveling down the road, which does seem to be the oldest use of the hoop as a playtime activity, right, Yeah, it wants to fall, It wants to fall over, sure, right, So if you can keep it going, then there's probably a tremendous amount of personal satisfaction that you can carry all the way to bedtime with and maybe have good dreams because.

00:04:38
Chuck: Of Yeah, I don't even see if you had a plastic polyethylene hula hoop, a modern hoop, I don't see how a stick like how you would even push it.

00:04:48
Josh: You would want a stick with maybe like a fork, No, probably something like a stick with a big wad of chewed bubblegum on it to like just have some sort of point of contact. Because, as we'll see when we talk about hula hoop physics, friction plays a big part in making hula hoops hula hoop.

00:05:08
Chuck: Yes, around the waist that is.

00:05:10
Josh: Well in any In this case as well, the stick makes contact with the hoop, you're using friction to push it along.

00:05:16
Chuck: Yeah, good point.

00:05:17
Josh: So I see your point. Like, if you're gonna use a stick on a like a plastic hula hoop, it's gonna slide off, or it's gonna want.

00:05:24
Chuck: To Maybe it scares me. That's why I think it's dumb. Maybe I would be made a fool of by the hoop. So I'm in timidy maybe.

00:05:30
Josh: At first, but chuck, you would have to hang in there and stick with it. Yeah, and pretty soon you'd be rolling hoops like an Egyptian kid.

00:05:38
Chuck: Yeah, like an ancient Egyptian child.

00:05:40
Josh: Yeah.

00:05:41
Chuck: Hoop rolling was a big deal throughout ancient Greece as well and Rome. They decorated them with bells and things and toys. Fifth century BC. There's you ever heard of ganny Mead? Of course, ganymedey Mead, gany Mead. He was a handsome hero. Oh, he was, he handsomest.

00:06:00
Josh: Supposedly there's an old fifth century BC urn of him where he's holding a rooster that was apparently a gift from Zeus. Yeah, and a hoop, a hula hoop, clearly a hula hoop. And apparently this discovery I'm not sure why it's called the Berlin painter eurn, but it is. Okay, again, no idea, but apparently they they said, well, I wonder if hoops played a role in the earliest Olympics. And I guess they've discredited that idea now, but for a while, because of this earn this picture of ganny Meade with a hoop, they wondered.

00:06:38
Chuck: Was it a sport? Yeah, an Olympic sport.

00:06:41
Josh: But the Greeks supposedly did use hoops for physical fitness as like a physical activity in very much the same way it's become popular today.

00:06:50
Chuck: I would imagine an Olympic hula hooper would be sort of like the you know, the uh what was the sport the curler of today? Are you kind of like an ancient Greece? Like, hey, what do you throw the hammer? What do you do? I'm hula hooper?

00:07:05
Josh: Oh, although I would guess it'd probably be more akin to the hula hoopers of today.

00:07:09
Chuck: Yeah, the hoop roller is what the sport would have been.

00:07:12
Josh: That'd be more like curling, right, hula hooping. That's tough, man.

00:07:17
Chuck: It is tough. What else? The ancient Britons they had a game called the battle game called Kill the Hoop. Yeah, I like this one when they would roll the hoop and throw try to throw a spear through it. Yep, pretty neat and dangerous and apparently they also used it in the hula method and it would people get injured.

00:07:38
Josh: Yeah, there was a fifteenth fourteenth or fifteenth century, fourteenth was it the fourteen hundreds or the fourteenth century fourteenth century hula hoop craze? Yeah in Britain? Isn't that bizarre?

00:07:51
Chuck: That is weird?

00:07:52
Josh: And yeah, people were getting injured there was a proclamation by the early physicians. They would pull up their like crows mask the masks just long enough to be like, stay away from hula hoops, steer clear of those things.

00:08:03
Chuck: Yeah, the warning was hoops kill was I guess what was posted on the church door.

00:08:09
Josh: And this is like in addition to being in the way of a spear that was being thrown at a rolling hoop. Yeah, like this is just from hula hooping.

00:08:17
Chuck: I would stay away from the hoops altogether if I was in ancient Briton.

00:08:21
Josh: Yeah, because really, if you're like an ancient Briton, Huh, you're going from like zero to sixty as far as like physical fitness goes. Sure once you're hula hooping.

00:08:30
Chuck: Oh yeah, you know, just because you're not just sitting around eating like a lamb's brains, right, yeah, drinking mead? Uh what else? The Native Americans have a long culture of using the hoop in New Mexico, the Taos Pueblo people, they use them in ritual dances, private healing ceremonies. And did you look up this chunky thing?

00:08:57
Josh: No, did you find the chunky reference?

00:09:00
Chuck: I did. The Cahokian Native Americans that.

00:09:04
Josh: Was an unusual way to pronounce that.

00:09:06
Chuck: Well, how would you say it?

00:09:08
Josh: Cahokien?

00:09:09
Chuck: I think in Native American would be hoke.

00:09:12
Josh: Okay, that's fine.

00:09:16
Chuck: Near Saint Louis apparently is where they played this game Chunky, which I just had to look it up because a game called Chunky with an E y and from what I saw, it was more of a small stone disc than like a hula hoop looking thing.

00:09:32
Josh: And you would it was like kill the hoop though in Britain.

00:09:35
Chuck: Right, Yeah, they would throw a stick. Apparently it looked like a combination of like bachi and and kill the hoop. Weird because I think they would try and throw the spear where the disc would eventually land, and the closest to the disc one.

00:09:51
Josh: Oh, that's how like they're predicting where this where the hoop would fall. I guess this makes sense, although that's not really like.

00:09:58
Chuck: Bachi at all. I mean, I get there's a proximity element that's bochi.

00:10:05
Josh: S yes, yeah, well put, but I don't know.

00:10:09
Chuck: I don't know, Like once I saw that and saw pictures, I was like, I don't even know if they should be in this article. Yeah, because it's like a small doughnut. That's a hoop of sorts, I guess. So it's a stretch if you asked me. But it was a big spectator sport, like fifty acre stadiums of people would watch this. Wow would go to junkie games and so chunkie matches.

00:10:29
Josh: So there was chunky matches in Coahokiah. Yeah, and the pueblo used there. I think, as you said, they used hoops, and they weren't the only ones. There were other tribes from all over North America and meso America. I believe that used hoops for dancing. Yeah, and apparently it was in nineteen thirty a guy named Tony white Cloud, who was a Yemez Pueblo down in New Mexico, did like a hoop dance in public and basically brought it back. Oh yeah, it had been virtually lost to the ages, at least as far as the average American was concerned. Yeah, most people didn't know this was the thing. Luckily, Tony white Cloub was like, check this out, did an awesome hoop dance, and then by nineteen ninety one there were national hoop dancing competitions in New Mexico and they're a big deal still to this day.

00:11:23
Chuck: Yeah, of course, I think. Did he kick off the American craze? Yes, no he didn't.

00:11:31
Josh: He was strictly native American hoop dancing, gotcha, not hula hooping.

00:11:37
Chuck: Okay, so let's go to well, let's take a break actually, because this is this is the big revelation here, that's right, all right, Josh, we're at that point where mainstream America goes hoop crazy.

00:12:14
Josh: But to get to that point, we actually have to go backward again in time for a second.

00:12:18
Chuck: Back in the way back machine.

00:12:19
Josh: So let's quote it running. Let's go to I don't know, Fiji or Tahiti or Polynesia. Yeah, and it's the eighteenth century. Yeah, see all these British sailors.

00:12:34
Chuck: Can we drink some rum?

00:12:35
Josh: Oh man? Okay, yeah, in addition to the room we've already drank today. All right, good, So the British sailors that you see here are noticing a houla dance, right, and they're filing it away in their mental catalog. And now when they reach Briton again, Yeah, why have we been saying it like that? I don't know, they notice that it bears a striking resemblance to what people do with the hula hoop.

00:13:05
Chuck: You gyrate every time you'd say that, by the way, you can't in your seat, can't not do it, Okay.

00:13:10
Josh: So the term hula became applied to the hoop, especially when you used your hips to gyrate. Sure to rotate them, Yes, when you rotate your hips with the hoop. These British sailors ended up applying the word hula to it, and it stuck. That's where it came from, was Polynesia.

00:13:28
Chuck: Right, even though there was no hoop involved in Polynesia? Correct, Yes, they just kind of ganked that word. Ye think their own purposes.

00:13:38
Josh: Is nineteen ninety seven all over again.

00:13:41
Chuck: That was a big nineties termo, wasn't it yanked?

00:13:43
Josh: Yeah? Let's go watch some X Files.

00:13:48
Chuck: Let's actually yeah, the movie's coming out soon right. Oh yeah, they're doing another one, aren't they. Yeah. That thing will never die. I don't think it should keep doing movies, That's what I say.

00:13:59
Josh: So. So we mentioned that the Greeks I believe used it for physical fitness, right.

00:14:07
Chuck: I don't think we said that.

00:14:08
Josh: I think I said it. Okay. The Swiss actually came to adopt it for the same reasons too. In the nineteenth century and early twentieth century.

00:14:18
Chuck: Yeah, someone named Emil Jacques Dalcroze and that was great. That's tough. Had a program called Eurythmics, which, of course I started singing Sweet Dreams this morning, of course because of that, and I've been singing it all day as a result. So that was a special training program and it was apparently a big deal.

00:14:41
Josh: It was a big deal. So eurhythmics used hoops for basically physical fitness but also interpretive dance that kind of stuff. It was a combination of It was like dance training is what I can gather, and it used hoops. The reason that we're mentioning this when we're talking about the American craze is that it directly led to the American craze potentially because eurhythmics spread from Switzerland to Great Britain and it was brought in as part of like pe class in Australia, and it was in Australia that the founders of Whammo were inspired to create the modern hula hoop that we think of today boom. So it's possible they watched the eurhythmics class or heard about a eurhythmics class with Australian kids and then said, well, this is a clearly something of Australian design and let's bring it to the US and start a craze.

00:15:36
Chuck: They said, sweet dreams were made of these. Yeah, and this was Richard Knerr and Arthur spud Melon mel maline melon sounds like.

00:15:48
Josh: M l O N like Thornton Mellon.

00:15:51
Chuck: Uh huh. Don't tease me with that movie, The Great Back to School. I saw a bit of that recently. Yeah, and the only thought through my head was like, man, why couldn't I have caught this from the beginning? Yeah, because I wanted to see it all.

00:16:05
Josh: That And man, his son is pasty.

00:16:09
Chuck: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought you were saying that was a line for the movie. It should have been. Yeah, his son Keith Gordon, who became a great movie director. Oh really Yeah, the guy from Christine and Back to School? Yeah yeah, yeah. He gave up acting and started directing movies and directed a bunch of good movies, one called Waking the Dead.

00:16:27
Josh: You should see, I thought Keith Gordon co starred, and they live.

00:16:33
Chuck: I don't know, Maybe I'll have to check that. So where were we oh yes. The two founders of Whammo, they said, you know what, let's take these wooden hoops, let's make them out of polyethylene. Let's make them forty inches, and let's charge a dollar ninety eight for them and make them all kinds of fun colors.

00:16:56
Josh: Yeah, and boom.

00:16:58
Chuck: The hula hoop craze in nineteen fifty eight was born.

00:17:01
Josh: Like it was the definition of a flash in the pan craze.

00:17:06
Chuck: Yeah, a lot of money in a very short span.

00:17:07
Josh: Of time, like a summer. Basically pretty much. In nineteen fifty eight, WMO released it, and by the end of nineteen fifty eight these things were rotting in the warehouse. But in the meantime they sold globally, globally from the summer to the end of nineteen fifty eight, one hundred million hula hoops.

00:17:29
Chuck: Yeah, more than that, I think.

00:17:31
Josh: Damn my brain.

00:17:32
Chuck: Yeah, you forgot what we were talking about.

00:17:34
Josh: I almost said frisbees.

00:17:36
Chuck: Did we do one on the frisbee?

00:17:38
Josh: No?

00:17:38
Chuck: I thought we had, but we haven't have we No, we did one on the boomerang. Oh right, just like a frisbee, but not it's like a dangerous frisbee. Uh So they sell all these hula hoops. They make a ton of money, like, you know, over fifty million dollars in a short span of time, which I'm sure they weren't happy with the that it didn't last, but they're all so probably like an injection of cash like that is great for any business.

00:18:03
Josh: Yeah. Then they moved on to the frisbee and made even more money.

00:18:06
Chuck: Yeah, and they did not secure a patent for it. I guess it didn't matter in the long run.

00:18:10
Josh: Well, they couldn't because it was so demonstrably an ancient invention that nobody could patent it. Nope, But they trademarked it.

00:18:17
Chuck: They did. They trademarked the name hula hoop in the United States, which is why we still call it hula hoop today. I guess. Yeah, it just became.

00:18:25
Josh: They should probably put the title with a R in a circle for this.

00:18:30
Chuck: Oh yeah, we should do that, like Barbie. Yeah. It was named the number thirty five a toy of all Time by Time magazine. And they know toys, they know their toys. And then from nineteen sixty eight to nineteen eighty one, there were national hula hoop contests held and the guests in the early eighties people were finished with it.

00:18:51
Josh: There were also like a tremendous amount of music, like musical singles released called the hula hoop song. Oh really, different people recorded different songs about hula hooping.

00:19:02
Chuck: Doesn't surprise me.

00:19:03
Josh: Yeah, it was a craze big time. Yeah, and you say that they were done with it by the eighties, not true. The national competitions there was so if you look at hula hooping records, yea, the most recent hula hoop records from two thousand and nine.

00:19:17
Chuck: Wow. But was that part of a national competition?

00:19:20
Josh: Probably for just a guy named Aaron Hibbs, he hula hoop, just hula hooped for seventy four hours and fifty four minutes. Wow. He broke the record of.

00:19:31
Chuck: I couldn't even stand up for that long.

00:19:33
Josh: He broke the record of a girl named Kim Koberly. She held the record twice, in nineteen seventy eight with fifty four hours and in nineteen eighty four for seventy two hours. Wow, which is pretty impressive.

00:19:46
Chuck: Yeah, people were still like hundreds of them at once.

00:19:49
Josh: Yeah. There was a guy named Paul Dizzy hips Blair who set the record in two thousand and nine with one hundred and thirty two hoops at the same time.

00:19:56
Chuck: Wow, that's impressive.

00:19:58
Josh: He's basically probably just like like the Michelin man made of hula hoops.

00:20:01
Chuck: Yeah. To ever tell you about the Surface Area Man costume and Athens. No, that was out on Halloween in Athens in college, and that was a dude. I know. The guy's name was Blake. He has you may have seen him. He had big red dreadlocks, kind of a short guy, just a ubiquitous Athens dude. No, he lives kind of in my neighborhood now. I still see him every once in a while. We called him Sideshow Blake because of Sideshow Bobs. Sure, and he came in the bar and the Georgia Bar, and he had these foam discs around his arms, around his legs, around his waist and neck that were huge, like probably four feet across, and he was Surface Area Man. And that was just his costume because when he moved around, he took up like, you know, probably seventy five square feet in space and he would just move through the bar and say Surface Area Man. And I'll always remember every time I see Blake. I saw him at the grocery store the other day.

00:21:00
Josh: Was he dressed like that?

00:21:01
Chuck: No? But I also like surface. He wouldn't fit down the grocery aisle.

00:21:04
Josh: Does he have dread still?

00:21:06
Chuck: Yeah? Does he really still rocking the red dreads?

00:21:09
Josh: He's dedicated?

00:21:10
Chuck: He looks exactly the same. Actually, but we weren't friends. I could actually see him. Actually, I'm gonna just walk by him and go surface area. Man, you should I'm gonna do it. All right, Let's talk about the Hudsucker Proxy for a quick moment, and then we'll take another break. Okay, did you ever see that one?

00:21:28
Josh: I don't think I made it through that one.

00:21:30
Chuck: The Coen Brothers, Yeah, uh not.

00:21:32
Josh: All of their movies are great.

00:21:34
Chuck: I disagree.

00:21:34
Josh: I love the Coen Brothers, but some of their movies stink.

00:21:38
Chuck: Oh boy, that they're part of my one hundred percent club where every movie they've made has been great?

00:21:43
Josh: That is wrong?

00:21:45
Chuck: Which other ones? Don't? You like?

00:21:46
Josh: The Man who Wasn't there?

00:21:47
Chuck: Loved it?

00:21:49
Josh: Bob Robertson, They didn't.

00:21:51
Chuck: That wasn't theirs?

00:21:52
Josh: Well it was terrible. Okay, uh? Well the Hudsucker Proxy too, all right, I liked it.

00:21:57
Chuck: I would put it at lesser Cohen's for sure, you'd have to. But I enjoyed it quite a bit. Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Lee and Paul Newman in a fictitious tale of the invention of the hula hoop. It is not the true biopic of the invention of the hula hoop, but they co opted it for one of their movies, and it was I think pretty great.

00:22:19
Josh: Okay, but that's just me, okay, so go ahead.

00:22:23
Chuck: Well, no, that was it. I just wanted to shout it out.

00:22:26
Josh: Fine, Well, then let's take a break because we're about to get into physics.

00:22:30
Chuck: Yeah, and hoop games yep.

00:22:33
Josh: After this, No Country for Old Men terrible. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:23:01
Chuck: Do you like that one?

00:23:02
Josh: I love that one. That's maybe the best. Raising Arizona is probably the best.

00:23:09
Chuck: It'd be tough for me to pick on any given day, but Fargo is the one I can watch over yeah and over.

00:23:13
Josh: Yeah. Yeah. I would say this three year type for first.

00:23:17
Chuck: Did we just come back from the break just segueing right back into the car?

00:23:20
Josh: I don't know.

00:23:20
Chuck: All right, let's do it.

00:23:21
Josh: We'll see how Jerry edits this, so.

00:23:24
Chuck: Let's it wouldn't be a stuff you should know podcast if we didn't talk about the science behind something seemingly unscientific.

00:23:31
Josh: Well, hula hoops are super complex as far as physics goes. You know that, super complex, super complex.

00:23:37
Chuck: There's just a few things.

00:23:38
Josh: We are not in agreement on stuff today, are we?

00:23:40
Chuck: I don't know what's going on.

00:23:41
Josh: So let's say you have a hula hoop, right, and it's around your waist, and you take it and you throw it. You have it up against maybe one hip, sure, making contact with your body.

00:23:52
Chuck: That you're starting in the traditional way, then.

00:23:53
Josh: Sure, and you whip it around, yeah, to one side, and as you do, you start rotating your hip. You're gyrating, right, I'm rotating my hips, chants, and as you do that, when you rotate your hips, what you're doing is, first of all, you're conserving the angular momentum you gave the hula hoop when you pushed it in a certain direction, you twisted it around yourself.

00:24:14
Chuck: Right, that's right. You are the axis.

00:24:17
Josh: Yes, you are the axis.

00:24:18
Chuck: Yes.

00:24:19
Josh: And when you move your hips around, when you rotate your hips, you're applying what's called torque.

00:24:25
Chuck: Yeah, Because all this hoop wants to do is fall down around on the ground and make you look foolish.

00:24:30
Josh: It wants to stop. Well, no, it doesn't want to stop because of inertia. It wants to keep going, but it can't because of friction. But it wants to fall down to the ground like you said, and make you look foolish. Yeah, but ironically that same friction is keeping it from doing that.

00:24:45
Chuck: Who's the fool now, hoop the hula hoop? Yep, fool? All right? Did you talk about the torque?

00:24:52
Josh: I did talk about torqu and torque is a twisting force where you're twisting your hips and you're thrusting the hula hoop in a circle, and what you're doing there is contributing to the centripetal force.

00:25:05
Chuck: That's right and centrific goal no centripet all two different things move.

00:25:10
Josh: Is a force that moves at a right angle to the motion of your body, so it keeps that thing whatever it is, say, hula hoop or tractor tire, which, by the way, someone set a record hula hooping with a tractor tire. Shut up, really yeah, for like seventy seconds of fifty four pound tire.

00:25:26
Chuck: How big was a person?

00:25:28
Josh: I'm sure it was ginormous. I think he was from like Baylor Roos or something, you know.

00:25:33
Chuck: Oh yeah, they do that on a daily basis.

00:25:36
Josh: So with the centripetal force is going at a right angle to the direction that you're thrusting your hips, it's constantly going to move around a circle on the axis. That is centripetal force. Boom, centripetal motion. I should say yes.

00:25:52
Chuck: And when the soop wants to fall, of course, we're talking about gravity. Gravity wants to win that fight. But if you keep that pulsing gyration going, then you're going to keep that hoop just a little ahead of the curve.

00:26:05
Josh: Yeah, that's apparently the key. And Robert puts this in here. Is it kind of like a throwaway thing?

00:26:10
Chuck: Yeah, that is the thing.

00:26:11
Josh: It's the key of hula hooping. Is you want your hip to move just before that that I guess wave that comes in contact with your body again, comes in contact, comes.

00:26:25
Chuck: Back around, catch and release in a way. Okay, you can catch it on your hip and then slinging it back around. Now I'm gyrating, yeah you are.

00:26:33
Josh: Wow, there's a lot of gyrating going on in this room right now.

00:26:36
Chuck: There is.

00:26:36
Josh: It's crazy.

00:26:38
Chuck: So there's a few different parts of the body at work. I don't know why in two thousand and four they needed a fifteen page study in the Journal of Biological Cybernetics to figure this out, because if you just look at somebody, you can tell that the hips, knees, and ankles are really what's at play keeping that thing going. And that's if you're just doing the hip who hoop, not right neck and legs and all that.

00:27:03
Josh: Of course, yeah, just the standard hooping right.

00:27:05
Chuck: Yeah.

00:27:05
Josh: And so another study I think four years later in the Journal of Human Movement side.

00:27:11
Chuck: I don't know why they needed that either.

00:27:12
Josh: They built upon this two thousand and four study and said, okay, you use your hips, knees, and ankles. Everybody uses it, but depending on the individual, there'll be different contributions from the hips, knees or ankle depends on the motion of your ocean exactly. So it's like the individual. Everybody uses the same the same parts, but they use them in different percentages to come up with the hula hooping motion.

00:27:38
Chuck: Yeah. I bet certain body types are better at this than others too.

00:27:42
Josh: Yeah, slim, yeah, yeah, probably.

00:27:45
Chuck: So I met the one in front of Craig's band. She was pretty slam I guess sure she's working that thing. Man. It was like, it was pretty amazing.

00:27:53
Josh: Hula hoop.

00:27:54
Chuck: So that's hoop dancing. When we'll finish up here with some other games.

00:27:58
Josh: Well, we didn't talk about hoop dancing. We were just talking about hula hooping.

00:28:01
Chuck: No, we talked about hoop dancing at the beginning with that lady. Oh yeah, okay, so that's hoop dancing. Okay, that's when you you know, it's around the neck and then you work it down around your hips and then up one arm and then up the other arm, right right, It's pretty impressive. Your standard hula hooping, of course, which we've covered. Speed endurance depends on what you're after. Sure, like I want to do this for twenty minutes.

00:28:24
Josh: Or I want to do it seventy four hours.

00:28:26
Chuck: Really fast for five minutes.

00:28:28
Josh: Okay. Hoop rolling, that's one of my favorite.

00:28:31
Chuck: Hoop trundling, Like you're a little ancient Egyptian kid.

00:28:35
Josh: Yeah, I I'd like to see you do that hoop rolling. Sure, let's do it.

00:28:40
Chuck: Let's do a video for that.

00:28:41
Josh: Okay, we could do a periscope of it. Oh yeah, let's do that.

00:28:45
Chuck: Are we going to start doing that?

00:28:46
Josh: We could do at least one of me hoop rolling.

00:28:49
Chuck: I think people, Well, we're going to get emails.

00:28:51
Josh: Yeah, they'll they'll turn out in droves to see that.

00:28:53
Chuck: Sure, hundreds of people will show it for that.

00:28:55
Josh: There's one not on this list that I want to give a shout out to you.

00:28:58
Chuck: All right?

00:28:58
Josh: What it was invented? Apparently in Belgium they call it Belgium skipping. It's called ankle skipping. It's where you put the hula hoop on one foot around one ankle, and you use it to hula hoop. You make the hula hoop motion with that one and as it comes around, you jump through the hoop with the other one.

00:29:16
Chuck: Yeah.

00:29:16
Josh: I can't believe it wasn't on this list.

00:29:18
Chuck: Yeah, that's a solid hoop endeavor.

00:29:20
Josh: But apparently it's a pretty recent invention from like the sixties.

00:29:23
Chuck: Oh really, all right, that makes sense. That's sort of like hoop jumping, but not quite.

00:29:29
Josh: No, hoop jumping is more like jump roping with a hula hoop.

00:29:32
Chuck: Yeah, but that kind of reminds me of that too.

00:29:34
Josh: Okay.

00:29:36
Chuck: Hoop jumping is when you hold the hula hoop the top of it, and then you swing it around your body and jump up and down.

00:29:43
Josh: Okay, like you have nothing better to do in life, right, Like you can't find a jump rope. You haven't heard of those before?

00:29:50
Chuck: Return the hoop. This is the only one I was ever good at. That's when you hold it vertically and you fling it out as hard as you can backwards, and it sort of spins place and comes back to you.

00:30:01
Josh: Right, And if you're not expecting it, you're going to turn and run because it is startling.

00:30:07
Chuck: We've already talked about kill the hoop. We don't recommend you use spears to do that, or just.

00:30:12
Josh: Make sure nobody's in the vicinity of where the hoop is. Yeah, you don't want to combine hoop chundling and kill the hoop because you'll kill the hoop chundlure.

00:30:22
Chuck: No, And I'm not even uncovered this last one. I dare you too, though.

00:30:26
Josh: I like this one. Hoop your environment, Yeah, right, go ahead. So it's like you put hula hoops around and you jump from them like they're islands and there's lava in between. Okay, what's wrong with that? I don't know too childish.

00:30:40
Chuck: No, I'm very childish, but I don't know. I just didn't.

00:30:43
Josh: There's your childlike not childish. Oh, gotcha, big difference, man.

00:30:48
Chuck: Uh, well, we talked about exercise. It is legitimate exercise. Our hula hoop classes. Now apparently Mursa Tomay, the actor, took hoop fitness classes to lose weight or to get in shape for her movie The Wrestler in two thousand and eight. First Lady Michelle Obama.

00:31:09
Josh: Has very famously hoop worked out.

00:31:11
Chuck: Yeah, hooped the lawn of the White House to say, hey, kids, get active and at the US Open, Yeah, you can still have fun by doing this. Yeah. And they even did another study to see what kind of calories you could burn.

00:31:24
Josh: Lots of hoop studies too many.

00:31:27
Chuck: They took women between sixteen and fifty nine and said go crazy and hoop and they yeah. And they were weighted hoops too, by the way, which is not to say they were super heavy. They're generally still pretty light weight.

00:31:44
Josh: Yeah, but strangely weighted hoop is easier to keep going.

00:31:48
Chuck: Yes, which makes sense, I think. And they average one hundred and fifty one beats per minute bpmat yeah, heart beats.

00:32:00
Josh: Oh their heart.

00:32:00
Chuck: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, tribe coal quests would be proud, right.

00:32:04
Josh: Uh.

00:32:05
Chuck: And that is burning seven calories a minute or two hundred and ten calories during a half hour of hooping. So that's good exercise people.

00:32:12
Josh: That's like weightlifting type calorie burn.

00:32:16
Chuck: Yeah.

00:32:16
Josh: Plus also like if you just break it down to calorie first of all, Chuck, I want to do an episode and I'm not quite sure how to frame it yet. It doesn't have a thesis. But there are so many like medical myths out there that are just taken as facture, even by the medical establishment, even though like if you asked a doctor like is this fact they would be like, no, no, actually, it's not like drinking eight glasses of water a day. Yeah, totally made up. And you're going to say that, Like, I think we should do one on medical myths sometime.

00:32:47
Chuck: What do you think we should have? We not?

00:32:50
Josh: No, Like part of me wants to say we have, but I think it things to have just come up like here or there over the years. Anyway, if even if you take the calories out of the equation, just hula hooping the standard hip gyration hula hoop, yeah, will really really work out your core.

00:33:11
Chuck: Yeah, like you need a hula hoop.

00:33:13
Josh: No, you can just sit in your chair and do what I'm doing now. Yeah, like I'm getting I'm sweating. Yeah right now, you totally are. My lip My upper lip is broken out in perspiration.

00:33:23
Chuck: Uh. Modern hooping burlesque uses hoops. If you go to any music festival these days, you're going to see the ladies like I was talking about, or they might have him decked out with LEDs or even fire.

00:33:35
Josh: Well what's neat is LED hula hoops in particular are really displaying like the physics of hula hoops pretty neat through Like, what's that type of photography LSD? No, No, uh, what's the what's that photography where you like you just keep the shutter open so it like high exposure, long exposure.

00:33:57
Chuck: Yeah, you just said it, keeping that shutter open. It's like when you see the pictures of the cars on the freeway right and it's just like a long trail of headlights.

00:34:04
Josh: Yeah, but there are photos out there of LED hula hoops there. It's just like you can see they don't just keep like a flat path. They go all over the place in some way. It's really neat.

00:34:14
Chuck: It's pretty cool. What about this lady, the Israeli sculptor. Did you watch that?

00:34:21
Josh: I saw a couple of pictures of it.

00:34:22
Chuck: Yes. Her name is Cigolette Landau, and in two thousand and three she did a performance art slash political statement piece where she did it was called barbed Hula and she was naked and hula hooped with a barbed wire hula hoop that just tore her abdomen up. Yeah, it's really rough. Yeah, it was pretty disturbing. But she said she was on an Israeli beach that she defined as the only common natural border Israel has. So she was making a statement to my friend, Well.

00:34:56
Josh: She's an artist.

00:34:57
Chuck: That's what they do.

00:34:59
Josh: I got a couple of last things. Let's hear it in the that hula hoop craze.

00:35:04
Chuck: Of the fifties of yeah, yes, yeah, not the not the fourteenth century Briton one. There.

00:35:11
Josh: It was in Japan, it was banned. The hula hoop was banned because they're worried it was going to lead to actual stuff things happening gyrating hips. Yeah, and apparently the Soviets said that it was a it was evidence of the emptiness of American culture, the hula hoop craze. Really, yeah, leave to the Soviets to be like Americans. Go on, they hated America. Do you remember when the Iron Curtain fell and you were like, oh, wait a minute, Like everything we were taught about the Soviet Union was basically made up.

00:35:46
Chuck: Yeah, and they were like, you know, the average Russian was like a good person.

00:35:50
Josh: Here, Yeah, and the average Russian was a lot like the average American, and.

00:35:53
Chuck: Yeah, drunk on vodka, I'm gonna live forever.

00:35:59
Josh: All right, that's it. If you want to know more about hula hoops, you can type that word into the search bar at housetuffworks dot com. And since I said search bar, it's time for the listener mail.

00:36:12
Chuck: I'm gonna call this anarexia.

00:36:15
Josh: Could you read this one?

00:36:15
Chuck: No?

00:36:17
Josh: See how I missed that one.

00:36:18
Chuck: Hey guys, I'm a huge fan. I want to let you know how you how Stuff you should Know has helped me over the years. I began listening if I love These, began listening at the age of twelve, and I'm now turning eighteen.

00:36:28
Josh: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:36:29
Chuck: August Night. Stuff you should Know has played a part in the young adult I've become. At twelve, I was diagnosed with restrictive anarexia, was hospitalized for about a month and did day treatment for almost a year. After leaving treatment for the day, I'd religiously put on my headphones and turn on stuff. You should know. The podcast was really helpful on bad days, especially if I had just had an argument with my parents or a difficult meal, or your humor was especially helpful. I remember laughing out loud many times in the car, which was quite a rare occurrence. I'm pretty solid recovery now. But your podcasts also helped me gain a better relationship with my sibling. My eating disorder costs a lot of tension between my sibling and I for quite a few years. But one day I invited her to listen to your podcast, so, if you should know, quickly became a part of her commute to university class. We occasionally would discuss the podcast topics.

00:37:20
Josh: Nice.

00:37:21
Chuck: We now have a tradition and I love this part too. We now have a tradition of listening to the Christmas Extravaganza together while in winter break, which is what we want people to do. Yeah, man to gather the family and make.

00:37:32
Josh: This a thing Yeah, it's pudding.

00:37:34
Chuck: Even though I don't know what we're going to get pretty slim on Christmas time.

00:37:38
Josh: I've got at least one great topic. Yeah, we need to start looking now though. You're right.

00:37:43
Chuck: Yeah, we've even gifted each other matching stuff you should know shirts. One year more recently, I received the very urgent texts letting me know in all caps that you guys were coming to Minneapolis this fall, and another text to let me know that Chuck's daughter Ruby shares the same birthday as our father. And I want to point out again and.

00:38:02
Josh: Josh, yeah, the Triumvirate.

00:38:04
Chuck: That's right. Your podcast gives us endless topics and inside jokes, and I can't thank you enough for bringing us closer together. Thanks again for being such a big part of my formative years. My sister and I can't wait to see you guys in Minneapolis this fall. That is from Emily, and she said, please shout out your sister Meghan.

00:38:22
Josh: Awesome, Emily, thank you for telling us all that like that really means the world to us.

00:38:27
Chuck: Yes, and best of luck in your continued recovery. That is tough stuff.

00:38:30
Josh: Yeah, and congratulations too.

00:38:32
Chuck: Yeah, Well, we should do an eating Disorder Podcast at some point that one's been hanging out there.

00:38:36
Josh: Yeah. Yeah, because you know, there's like a whole there's like this new idea that like almost everybody has an eating disorder in America these.

00:38:44
Chuck: Days of some kind.

00:38:45
Josh: Yeah, like typically binge eating is like a huge thing. Sure, yeah, we should definitely do that. Yeah, but thank you very much, Emily and hello sister Meghan. We appreciate you guys listening, and hopefully we'll see you guys in Minneapolis when we come in out.

00:39:00
Chuck: Yeah, and you know what, actually write me back. We'll put you on the guest list. Oh man, how about that?

00:39:05
Josh: So nice?

00:39:05
Chuck: Free tickets for YouTube?

00:39:07
Josh: Wow, that is something just for YouTube. O.

00:39:09
Chuck: Guess right, just kidding.

00:39:12
Josh: Oh, you need to lay it down. We should probably have a legal disclaimer added after this too.

00:39:16
Chuck: Yeah, we might hear from a lot of Emily and megans Minnesota.

00:39:20
Josh: If you want to get in touch with us, you can tweet to us at s y SK podcast. You can join us on Facebook dot com, slash Stuff you Should Know. You can send us an email at Stuff Podcast at house stuffworks dot com and has always joined us at our home on the web. Stuff you Should Know dot com
