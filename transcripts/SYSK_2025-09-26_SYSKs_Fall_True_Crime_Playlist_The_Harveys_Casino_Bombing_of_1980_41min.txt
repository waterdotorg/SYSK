================================================================================

00:00:01
Josh: The bombing of Harvey's Casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada is one of the great overlooked capers. It's kind of nuts how anything like the Harvey's bombing could ever be forgotten considering the outcome. This episode has it all. A great plot in competent criminals, an amazingly well designed bomb, and a huge explosion. And it's made even cooler somehow because it takes place in nineteen eighty plus no one dies, which makes it okay for me to call this episode kind of charming. Enjoy.

00:00:34
iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:44
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here and this is Stuff you Should Know. The true crime edition where nobody gets hurt. Isn't that amazing?

00:00:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah? I think this falls into our sort of caper edith.

00:00:59
Josh: Yes, well put well put edition. Do we have any other capers?

00:01:04
iHeart Intro: Yeah, like the Chow Chilli kidnapping And I think any non murder crime podcast I think would fall under this. TB.

00:01:11
Josh: Cooper right exactly. And before I forget Chuck, that was definitely a caper. Good call. This was a request which, like you said last time. We've been doing a lot of these lately, but this one's requested by Nick Hales, and I say, good request Nick, Thanks for that, And I totally spaced on shouting out Neil Stevens from the UK for Georgia Guideston's episode. He requested it and gave me the idea to do it.

00:01:39
iHeart Intro: All right, nice work. This one was so familiar to me that I was sure that we had either touched on it or that I saw. What I really thought was that I saw a documentary about it, but I hadn't because I don't think there's been one. I don't know what it is. It was really familiar with some other true life thing that I saw.

00:02:00
Josh: I don't know, I don't know, but the fact that there's not a movie about this is insane.

00:02:05
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I don't know if it's movie worthy.

00:02:07
Josh: Oh really? Yeah? Oh man, just like the pork Chop Sideburns alone, I think would warrant a movie. But because I said pork chop Sideburns, of course we're talking about nineteen eighty, right, Chuck, August twenty sixth, nineteen eighty.

00:02:22
iHeart Intro: That's right. And on August twenty sixth, nineteen eighty very early in the morning. A couple of delivery dudes would be delivery dudes wield a big piece of equipment, had a cover on it, said IBM into Harvey's Resort Hotel in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Shout out to our buddy, Aaron Hagar representing Lake in Tahoe. Oh yeah, he's got it made out there in Tahoe. Nice except for the bears and wildfires.

00:02:51
Josh: I'll bet he's heard of this story.

00:02:53
iHeart Intro: Then, I bet you he has. We'll hear from him on this. But anyway, they wheeled in there, up to the second floor offices and dropped it off and basically skid autled. After that, they had a guy waiting in a van outside and drove them the heck out of there.

00:03:08
Josh: Yeah, so it's kind of weird five am to drop off a piece of office equipment, not waiting around for everybody to sign it. Kind of odd. And within an hour the oddity behind it kind of became really apparent. A slot manager, I believe, or maybe the night manager in general, he noticed this piece of office equipment that was kind of randomly placed on the second floor offices, and he saw that there was a note by it, and he gathered some other employees and they were all kind of hanging out reading the note. And one of the details I love that I saw in a Adam higginbottom article on the atavist was that one of the people reading the note was leaning up against the machine while they were reading the note.

00:03:50
iHeart Intro: All right, the notes, sid, Should we read the note?

00:03:54
Josh: Yeah, because then it makes the whole thing about somebody leaning up against it really hilarious.

00:03:58
iHeart Intro: All right, stern warning to the management and bomb squad, in which case I would have been out of there. That's all I need to hear, right exactly. Do not move or tilt this bomb because the mechanism controlling the detonators in it will set it off at a movement of less than point zero one of the open end Richter scale. So let's confuse people right out of the gate. Is with this note, is what this guy's thinking. Sure, don't try to flood or gas the bomb. There's a float switch and an atmosphere pressure switch set at two numbers twenty six point zero zero to thirty three. Both are attached to detonators. Do not try to take it apart. The flathead screws are attached to triggers, and as much of a quarter to three quarters of a turn will cause the explosion. In other words, this bomb is so sensitive that the slightest movement, either inside or outside, will cause it to explode full stop.

00:04:51
Josh: Yeah. And you can guess the person leaning against the machine stood up and moved away from it, right.

00:04:56
iHeart Intro: That's right. And basically they said, I love that part. No one can detonate or no one can can deactivate this bomb, not even I, not even the creator can diffuse this thing. So it is going to go off at some point. Your best hope of not getting hurt is to pay a three thousand dollars ransom, and you're going to receive instructions on how to move it out of here so it can explode somewhere else.

00:05:21
Josh: Yeah, and it would have been a bargain for three thousand dollars. There was actually a three million dollar ransom and to save three thousand you did, I think you were being optimistic. Yeah, but it was a it was a big fat ransom. And the bomb itself, I mean, if you just look at the at the ransom note when it's talking about the bomb, that's a pretty amazing bomb. And It actually became pretty legendary with the FBI, so much so that I saw that they still I don't know if they still do today, but for many years they used it as a teaching model for bomb technicians, and the FBI considered it very sophisticated, and they, I said, it was unlike anything any bomb technician had ever seen before. No one had ever made a bomb like this.

00:06:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah, very good bomb, if there was such a thing. It was a couple of stacked boxes ligned with metal and rubber that through conventional methods, you couldn't separate, of course without it going boom. And so that FBI did what they do in this case. They come in, they start taking pictures, they X ray it, they sweep it for fingerprints. Obviously, they don't move it. They find out that it has about a thousand pounds of dynamite inside. Yeah, and they can't find a way to Like basically they're saying, this note seems to be right on the money, Like we can't find a way at least right off the bat about how to diffuse this thing safely.

00:06:45
Josh: Yeah, and very famously, the bomb technicians in the room started running around in aimless circles saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. And they did that for a good three hours, I think before somebody stepped in and stopped them. But that handsome note also showed a lot of planning, not just the bomb. This bomb was amazing, just full stop, amazing, one to really be proud of if you were a bomb maker. But the actual heist itself had like a real shot at extorting this three million dollars successfully. And it started with they knew what they were doing. Out of the gate. They said, we want three million dollars in used bills, one hundred dollars bills already used, not marked, not bug don't even try to chemically treat them. And we want you to fly a helicopter to Lake Tahoe Airport, have the pilot land by the payphone, and wait by the payphone for instructions. Our instruction is going to come from the payphone. Who knows. They could also come by taxi. They could also come by carrier pigeon. I'm making that last one up. But they were just trying out of the gate to confuse them so that they couldn't plan for everything. And it was I think it was a really well planned heist.

00:07:59
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean basically said, no one involved from this point that you meet up with, like anyone that might deliver a note, any someone that might drive a vehicle that's involved, Like, no one's going to know anything, So don't bother. And I think I believe that that's probably true. They said that the you know, I the creator of the bomb, I'm not going to be a part of this money drop. I'm not going to be around Nobody that's a part of any of this exchange of money is going to know anything about how to diffuse this bomb. Like, this thing is going to go off and there's nothing you can do to stop it. Again, the only thing that you can do is follow what will ultimately be six sets of instructions to safely get this bomb out of there after I get my loot.

00:08:45
Josh: Yeah, after he gets the loot or they so, the first set of instructions was going to be given to the helicopter pilot. The rest of the instructions would arrive through the local post office, which is putting a lot of a lot of faith in the USPS. But then there was another demand too, that was probably the most ridiculous demand of all. They said that all news media, local or national was to be kept ignorant of the heist until the bomb was successfully removed, right, yeah, And that was impossible, totally impossible because the first thing the cops did when they realized like this is for real, which they figured out pretty quickly. I think the thing was discovered before six am, and by seven or eight at the very latest, they were rousing hotel guests at Harvey's, many of them from sleep, telling them like, nope, you don't have time to grab your belongings. You got to go. And not only did they evacuate Harvey's. A thousand pounds of dynamite can do some real damage, they actually evacuated heras across the street from Harvey's too.

00:09:46
iHeart Intro: Yeah, so they said you're all going to go to this nearby high school. And of course the media it's a big thing when that happens, when people are being like massively bust out in their bathrobes and stuff. So basically within a few hours, like all the media knows this, they cordon off the area. There's people hanging out, there's gawkers, there's reporters, there's before you know it, of course, because there's casinos around there. They're taking bets, of course, like over under on whether this thing's going to detonate. And not only did they not keep the media out of it, but it became like I mean, call the sensation indicates that it drug on. It was like a day and change, but it was a crazy day and change for the media for sure.

00:10:30
Josh: And it was over the week before Labor Day weekend, so Tahoe was crawling with people. And this was nineteen eighty right, just thirty six years before the first casino was opened on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. And it was opened by the same guy who's hotel now how to bomb in it, Harvey Gross. His first thing was Harvey's wagon Wheel Saloon and gambling Hall, which I saw described as a cabin that had six slot machines in it. And at the time in Tahoe Chuck there was no phone, no water, no sewer, no power lines. The roads would close at like the first sign of snow, and it was like a real podunk area. But gambling made it actually put it on the map.

00:11:19
iHeart Intro: For a second there. I thought you were going to say, not a single luxury.

00:11:23
Josh: Oh man, I really should have I wish I had I'm not on my game today.

00:11:29
iHeart Intro: Like Robinson Caruso. There were what primitives can be.

00:11:32
Josh: Right, that's what they said. But it was the sixties. You wouldn't say that anymore.

00:11:38
iHeart Intro: So things go great for Harvey and his little wagon wheel cabin. You know, it's on the state line of California. So that's a pretty smart thing because you get those out of staters, those richies from California throwing down some money.

00:11:52
Josh: Yeah, and it was so on the state line. It was in a town called state Line.

00:11:56
iHeart Intro: That's very Nevada.

00:11:58
Josh: It's very on the nose. I'm so nervous about us saying it the right way because those people will email you like Gangbusters.

00:12:06
iHeart Intro: Oh it's Nevada. But I always say Nevada.

00:12:09
Josh: Okay, but they say it Nevada.

00:12:11
iHeart Intro: Yeah, everyone outside the state of Nevada says Nevada. And that drives them.

00:12:15
Josh: Nuts, drives them crazy. It's really something.

00:12:18
iHeart Intro: So Harvey, no, let's wait on break. So Harvey was doing great with this little tiny casino in the forties through the fifties makes a lot of dough and by sixty three had expanded and upgraded to Harvey's Lake Tahoe, which at the time was the tallest building at eleven stories, which is you know, that's a pretty tall building for that area of the country.

00:12:43
Josh: Yeah, less than twenty years. Who went from a cabin to an eleven story casino resort? Yeah, and I believe it was at that same eleven story casino resort that this bomb was placed in nineteen eighty, seventeen years later. And Harvey himself was like, I mean, he was a casino owner in Nevada. Like he had I don't want to say a checkered past, but he had a pass like he'd been hauled in front of the irs for tax evasion. There was. He had been given an honorary name by the Nevada Inner Tribal Did I say it right Nevada?

00:13:18
iHeart Intro: Nope?

00:13:20
Josh: By the Nevada Inner Tribal Council. He was called Chief who Nai. And there was an article that was written back in I think nineteen eighty that said that it meant the man who runs the game and takes a percentage of the bets.

00:13:34
iHeart Intro: I don't know if that's a joke or not. I can't tell.

00:13:36
Josh: I don't either, because that's definitely like that era kind of joke. You know, you can see that on like a tiki napkin.

00:13:45
iHeart Intro: But the long and short of it is he was He'd had his little run ends with the irs and stuff and the gaming board, but it wasn't anything unusual. He wasn't like some bad guy like mafioso type. He was, like you said, he owned a casino and there's you know, he's gonna be brought up by the irs at some point. But all of this to say, he wasn't like some some big mark because of all his dirty dealings in his past.

00:14:11
Josh: Basically I saw him actually referred to as a good guy by some people. It sounds like it like he was well known to have put off expansion, like he didn't want to expand to other towns. He's basically said, I'm making enough money. He had a quote that he would refer to as I have a nice little business. How many steaks can I eat? Which is to say like he had everything he needed and this was fine. He was happy with his business where it was.

00:14:39
iHeart Intro: That's right. But it was the seventies and into the early eighties, which was just sort of the golden age of all this kind of stuff of kidnappings and ransoms and hijackings, and it just seems like all this kind of high jinks. There's still stuff like that happens ocasionally, but not like it did back then.

00:15:01
Josh: I think it's because, Chuck, the police state hadn't evolved enough that they would catch you no matter what. Yeah, AMers everywhere now right, and leaded gas had been around long enough to really have the effects on a whole new generation of brains. So you put those two things together, you have everything converging on the seventies for people trying all sorts of heists and kidnappings and stuff like that.

00:15:25
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and that happened back then around there even I think as far back as the early seventies there were kidnapping conspiracies against gross ransom things that had been uncovered in the late seventies. There were smoke bombs with ransom notes found at other casinos around Tahoe.

00:15:43
Josh: So I don't know about that.

00:15:44
iHeart Intro: It was what the smoke bombs?

00:15:46
Josh: Yeah, what is that? You might as well say, like there's a box of sparklers in your lobby, give me five hundred thousand simoleons, or else give.

00:15:56
iHeart Intro: Me thirty five cents, I know, to pay me back for the smoke both. So it was a time where if you owned a casino that brought in I think he made about four million profit, but brought in like seventy million dollars a year like his did, then that simply just meant you were a mark by virtue of that fact alone.

00:16:17
Josh: Right. The thing is, though, is the FBI found out as they started investigating the case about a year after that, it actually was a personal vendetta against Tarve himself or Harvey's casino that led to that bomb being placed there in August of nineteen eighty.

00:16:33
iHeart Intro: That sounds like a great cliffhanger for a break.

00:16:35
Josh: Thank you, Thanks man.

00:16:37
iHeart Intro: All Right, we'll get back to it right after this, all right, And so we're back in action here at the bomb site. The FBI's bomb squad is working hard trying to figure this thing out. They have another team working on a fake ransom drop. Special Agent William Jonky basically told Harvey, hey, listen, why don't we drag this thing out as much as we can. We'll do a fake payoff arrangement. Maybe we can just sort of put off this bomb going off long enough for us to figure it out either how to stop it or how to catch these people, like, the bomb is going to go off no matter what. And once Gross heard that, he was like, well, I'm not paying anything. If this thing's going off no matter what, you can use my By God, you can use my own helicopter for the drop even And that's what they did. They use his own personal helicopter. But the pilot was a fed, and there was another fed with a gun hiding behind the pilot's seat with a suitcase full of mostly fake money.

00:17:55
Josh: Yeah, I think a few grand is what I saw. And just like the ransom note said, the agent flew the helicopter Lake Tahoe Airport, landed next to the payphone and got there just in time from what I saw, just for the phone to start ringing, although I suspect they were being watched and the phone rang and rather than giving them instructions over the phone, I think it's hilarious that they said, look underneath the phone. There's instructions taped beneath the phone, and then I guess hung up.

00:18:23
iHeart Intro: We didn't want to tape it to the front of the phone.

00:18:25
Josh: Booth, right, So he checks out the instructions and it says, okay, this is what you're gonna do. You're going to fly west along the highway for fifteen minutes from the airport, and you're going to turn. There's some compassitting and they told him to turn toward I never found which one. And then after a certain amount of time he should start looking for a beacon, which is going to be a strobe light in a field. He should land there and that's where the money drop would happen. And so the pilot took off and he did exactly as the thing instructed, the ransom note instructed, and there was nothing. He flew around for forty five minutes, just waiting, hoping. I guess probably came close to running out of gas. And then he flew back to the Lake Tahoe airport and went back to the payphone in case they called to say, like, what the heck's going on? And they never did call. Actually, so the money drop never happened.

00:19:15
iHeart Intro: I wonder. The FED takes off and he's got the other FED behind him hiding with a gun, and he's like, hey, how do you think this guy knows how far we're going to be in fifteen minutes? And the other fed went beats me, and that's exactly what happened. And it's at this point in the story where we will introduce you to the guy behind the whole thing, and we'll learn more about him later. But his name was John Waldo Burgess Sor and that was one of the key mistakes he made. He kind of botched this money drop because he should have said miles, like fly so many miles, or fly to this destination. He just said fly for fifteen minutes. And I don't know if he put at like at an average rate of speed for your helicopter. Right, But the long and short of it is they didn't know after he had flown fifteen then it's exactly where he was going to end up. And they were like, well, that stinks. And this is after they had forgotten the battery to the Strobe light.

00:20:17
Josh: Right, they left it in Fresno.

00:20:19
iHeart Intro: They eventually got one. Yeah, they left it at their place. They eventually got one. They tried to break into an autopartch store to get one and got chased off, and then got one at a shell station. So they had the Strobe. But by the time all this happens, they don't even know where the helicopter is.

00:20:35
Josh: No, and that shell station also has its own hilarious story because the gas station attendant they were trying to buy the battery from basically was like, why no, you need this kind of battery for the Volvo that you have parked outside that you're driving. They're like, it doesn't matter what kind of battery it's for. He's like, well, yeah, it does, because Volvo won't take any battery. And they finally, I guess, convinced him to just sell them a battery and he's like, fine, I guess you're gonna find out yourself that it's not gonna work, and they finally drove off. That's how they got the battery. But they made it to that drop point, which was twenty five miles away from the airport, and they sat there and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited. No helicopter. No helicopter came. And the reason why is because they were separated, separated by so many miles. They couldn't even hear the helicopter where it was. It was so far away from where they were at the drop site.

00:21:29
iHeart Intro: All right, so this is botched. Back at the bomb site at the casino, this a full on party is going on because it's a casino and people are just out of their minds at those places. So the barricades are set up, people are selling T shirts. I got bombed at Lake Tahoe. I had a dynamite time at Lake Tahoe. Like that's how quickly this thing was moving. And the bomb squad team said, all right, here's what I think we should do, like they call this and they said, if we flip switch number five, then it'll buy some more time because this thing isn't playing out quite right. But I don't know if I trust that. No one volunteered to flick that switch like they felt basically, we should go on our own, like with our own gut feeling on how to do this, which is to basically blow this box apart, but do it so quickly that it severs the relay switch, like before the signal can reach the dynamite.

00:22:25
Josh: Yeah, it's just pretty fast. And it was possible. They had They had some of the greatest minds in the United States who knew about bombs working on this problem, and they designed to charge especially for this, and it was built and brought to the site and put up and they said, this still has at best a twenty five to thirty percent chance. But we talked to the engineer, one of the engineers at Harvey's, and he said, it probably won't bring the whole building down, so let's give it a shot. And so, almost thirty five hours after the bomb had been discovered, around three pm the next day, a guy named Daniel was the person who volunteered to go take the charge, put it on the bomb exactly at the angle he was told to put it at, and then walked out and started the countdown for the remote triggering. And remember there are hundreds, if not thousands of people thronged together to watch this to see if it worked. And when they finally did, apparently, they broadcast the radio the countdown on local radio Chuck. And when they finally set it off, that charge did not work the way it was intended.

00:23:33
iHeart Intro: No, it set off the bomb. The entire thing went off, and it was, like we said, it was a thousand pounds of dynamite. It created a forty to fifty foot hole in the ground in the middle of this casino, shooting shrapnel everywhere, obviously, shooting cash and chips everywhere, which is obviously problematic. They said, there were TV sets swinging on cords, toilets hanging by the pipes. It was a huge, massive explosion in the middle of a casino. And because it's a casino and because it's Tahoe, it was not very long afterward that the surrounding casinos got right back to business, and it didn't take too long. A couple of days before Harvey's got back to business. With what was left of the casino, they put glass around it and was kind of like, hey, come see the bomb hole and gamble some.

00:24:26
Josh: And watch the FBI work on this crime scene that just took place. So one of the other great details of this story for me is that the bandits didn't know that the bomb had been detonated, and so a few minutes after the bomb went off, they called the local sheriff's office and said, we'll be calling back in one hour to arrange another payment drop.

00:24:48
iHeart Intro: He said, whatever.

00:24:49
Josh: Yeah. Can you imagine like the person who took the call being like, oh, yeah, great, okay, we'll talk to you in an hour.

00:24:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah yeah, So that didn't matter. Harvey Gross was very sad. He just cried and he saw the damage eighteen million dollars worth of damage, and you know, we'll tell you what ultimately happened later. But they got back to business, like I said, and I guess we should talk a little bit more about who this mastermind was.

00:25:17
Josh: I agree, Chuck, and I say, before we start talking about the mastermind behind the plot, we take a.

00:25:22
iHeart Intro: Break, all right, let's do it.

00:25:43
Josh: So we already revealed who it was. A guy named John Burgess, and his son wrote a book later that I saw. He called the publisher to find out how many copies had been sold at the time, and they told him zero. But in this book he depicts his dad as not a very nice guy. He was an abusive husband, physically abusive, a really terrible dad. He liked to emotionally blackmail his family by threatening to take his life by suicide. And he was an actual Nazi, like a genuine Nazi. Just to put the cherry on top of everything.

00:26:19
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he flew for the Luftwaffa and spent eight years in a Soviet prison camp before coming to America and becoming a multimillionaire, So it kind of ended up okay for him. He had a landscaping business in Fresno that apparently did really, really well but he also liked to gamble a lot and lost a ton of money over the years. I think about seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars they'd estimated that he lost. I think at Harvey's alone, right.

00:26:49
Josh: I think that was the whole shebang, But most of that was at Harvey's. That was my take on.

00:26:55
iHeart Intro: It, okay, And we do need to put a pin in something else, is that years before he had a business, a restaurant that it was pretty clear that he burned down for the insurance money, got up three hundred and fifty five thousand dollars from that and gambled that away.

00:27:13
Josh: Yeah, he was that kind of guy, right. So the heist itself, it was it was an attempt to make back some of the money that the house had taken from him over the years that he felt bitter about. But also the reason that he targeted Harvey's, they later found out, was that on some New Year's Eve a year or two before he had been given the high Rollers suite. That's how often he gambled at Harvey's, Like he was well known there, but he had amassed such a debt that they actually took him that evening out of the high roller suite and put him in a regular room. Was in much to his great humiliation. Yeah, I mean that was pretty much why he, at very at least why he targeted Harvey's. He considered that quite a loss of pride because I I guess he was with a date and the date was like I thought you said you were a big time right, which didn't make it any better. So that's why Harvey's got targeted in particular.

00:28:08
iHeart Intro: That's right. And they put Aaron Hagar in that suite instead.

00:28:12
Josh: They did, and everything was right with the world.

00:28:15
iHeart Intro: That's right. So actually Aaron's he's about mate. So he would have been a kid back then, or maybe they did.

00:28:21
Josh: He could have been high rolling.

00:28:23
iHeart Intro: Maybe he was like a nine or ten year old, like running the show in that gambling room.

00:28:27
Josh: I could totally see it.

00:28:28
iHeart Intro: So we mentioned he was Burgess Senior. There was a Burgess Junior. He had a couple of sons, John Junior and Jimmy, who were twenty and eighteen respectively, and then Jimmy or wait, was Ella Williams the senior's girlfriend. Yes, okay, so he had a girlfriend named Ela Williams who were also in on it. And these two numbskulls who delivered the bomb, named Bill Brown and Terry Hall.

00:28:53
Josh: The FBI later said after they caught Bill Brown they described him or no, it was from a report like somebody who witnessed the bomb being delivered. They said one of them was a hay seed, a real goober type. That's how they described Bill Brown. And it's sad for Bill Brown and Terry hallchuck, because they got a total of twenty one hundred bucks. But it wasn't until after they were driven away early that morning that they were told what they'd just done. They did not know that they were delivering a bomb until after they delivered the bomb. Isn't that terrible?

00:29:26
iHeart Intro: Yeah? I mean they they were probably just sold here some money, go deliver this thing.

00:29:30
Josh: That was a lot of money, that's exactly right. Yeah, and John Burgess Junior just totally misled him, which is another mark against that guy.

00:29:38
iHeart Intro: All Right, So spinning back a little bit, when they hatched this plan, the first thing they did was go out and get all this dynamite which they stole from a power plant in California and stash it in their walk in freezer in their garage and started building this bomb, and no one. That's kind of one of the mysteries of this. It was such a sophisticated device, and no one still really knows how this guy managed to build this thing, if he had help, if he was just this bomb genius that no one knew about, or was just super smart and did his research, but no one really knows how he managed to build such a sophisticated bomb.

00:30:19
Josh: I mean, it's still not clear. I don't think anybody will ever know he just did it. And what's crazy is John Burgess might have gotten away with the whole thing. The FBI did not. They were not on him initially. They interviewed something like five hundred suspects in the whole case. And there were two things that seemed to have brought Burgess down. One was a hotel owner who was the night manager of the hotel that Burgess, Brown, and Hall stayed at before they planted the bomb. Her name was Nancy Domenico, and she found those three suspicious enough that she wrote down their license plate on their van, model color and the license plate number and just kept it on file just in case. And it turned out that would become really important later on. And then the other factor was John Burgess Junior had a really loud mouth.

00:31:12
iHeart Intro: It turns out, yeah, he had a girlfriend leading up to the event, and he would just brag all about this thing. They break up. You never think about the breakup side of things when you're spilling your innermost thoughts. Yeah, and she has a new boyfriend, tells him all about this guy I dated before you that told me all about this bomb plot. The new boyfriend calls in the FBI tip. So now they have a couple of tips pointing to these dudes. Yeah, they tracked down the van that the Nancy Domenico had reported as shady, and it was a van that was registered to the restaurant that Burgess Senior allegedly had burned down. So that's where that comes back into play.

00:31:56
Josh: Yeah, so they're like, okay, let's go interview John Burgess Senior, and on Burgess Senior says, oh, John Junior was driving the van.

00:32:03
iHeart Intro: Completely gave his immediately.

00:32:06
Josh: Yeah, I mean like that first interview said him, probably said here's his address. Hopefully at least called his son to give him a heads up. I don't know. But they went over and they interviewed John Junior and he said, yes, I was around uh Tahoe at the time. Yes, I was with my van, but I was looking for places to plant marijuana. And you know that's true because I've just admitted to a crime to the FBI, right right. And apparently the FBI didn't didn't really buy it. They said, like, this story is awful, but he stuck to it and they didn't have anything else they could get him on right then, but he was definitely on their radar from that point forward.

00:32:45
iHeart Intro: I thought it was a pretty good story to be put on the spot. Personally, Well, well, it didn't work, but like to admit to another crime, I was like, right, all right, not bad, I'll give you that part.

00:32:56
Josh: The part of the FBI. The FBI was like, you're you're kidding, right, He's said the battery died, so I abandoned the van. Somebody must have taken it and used it in the crime and then brought it back while I was away from the van.

00:33:10
iHeart Intro: Right well, which is a long way of saying, was it wasn't me, right exactly. So they you know, they do what they do in the movies. They don't have enough hard evidence, so they spend a year getting that evidence building a case.

00:33:24
Josh: I'm a montage with a great like upbeat song where they're putting this stuff together. Right.

00:33:29
iHeart Intro: Sure, I don't know why John Junior and John Senior are still in the country. I would have been out of there so fast.

00:33:37
Josh: Where would you go?

00:33:39
iHeart Intro: I'd leave the country?

00:33:41
Josh: I know where where'd you go?

00:33:42
iHeart Intro: Oh, that's a really good question. Everyone just always talks about, like who would you have over for dinner? Living or dead? Like where would you go if you were guilty of a bombing blot?

00:33:53
Josh: I mean, it's got to be a non extradition treaty country, right, So you're looking at like Venezuela.

00:33:58
iHeart Intro: I'd have to do my research then, but yeah, I would go someplace with a beach and like a very quiet life. Okay, yeah, and then they just you know, they eventually show up at the beach in the movie as well. So yeah, but I tie out of your hands, and your Canada has beaches, sure, lovely beaches. Not quite the beaches I was looking for, though, You're welcome, Chunk. So the FBI is getting this evidence. They have rewards. I think like a half a million bucks is about as high as the reward went. And finally about a year later, they arrest John Junior and Jimmy and they say, they dangle a little carrot in front of their faces, how would you like to how'd you like to turn on dad and maybe get a little leniency And they went that jerk, I'm happy to And that's exactly what they did.

00:34:55
Josh: Right, And they turn on their dad. They arrested their dad. They arrested Ella william Bill Brown, Terry Hall, and from what we understand, every single person who had anything to do with that was rounded up in one fell swoop basically, and the conviction started coming out. Ella Williams got seven years for her involvement. And she hasn't factored in hugely into this podcast, but she was definitely an accomplished She typed the ransom notes up, she did a lot. I think she dropped some people off at one of the landing sites, like she was very much involved. So she got seven years, but a judge later overturned her conviction, and I couldn't see why. But as far as I know, she did not do any time in prison. Maybe beyond her trial.

00:35:38
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think the sons did get that leniency. As for John Senior, he represented himself in court. Cross examined his own sons. Eventually got twenty years in federal prison, and then I believe life without parole in state prison.

00:35:55
Josh: Yeah. The big key to his defense was his son's had given him a father's day car that said you're the best dad around ten years before. It didn't work on the jury.

00:36:06
iHeart Intro: That's sorry, how could I have done this? He served sixteen years, died in prison of cancer. But then there's one final little potential twist here.

00:36:16
Josh: Right, Yeah, so John Burgess had talked to a reporter while he was alive and he said, you know what, this wasn't my idea. I was a patsy, I was a rube. I got and I got dragged into this by a loan shark. I owed sixty large too. That's what you say when you're a gambler. And he recruited me to plant this bomb. And that really the loan shark was working on behalf of Harvey's top executives and the mafia who were conspiring to blow the place up so that they could collect the insurance money.

00:36:48
iHeart Intro: Look you there, you believe it not at all?

00:36:51
Josh: No?

00:36:51
iHeart Intro: Same, no, and the like the.

00:36:55
Josh: The thing that just like completely proves it is yeah, they used insurance money to rebuild. It's like, No, that doesn't prove anything. Of course you're going to use insurance money to rebuild. It doesn't mean there was a conspiracy there.

00:37:07
iHeart Intro: Right, Is that place still there any idea?

00:37:09
Josh: Yeah, it's still there. I think it's been updated even more since then. But yeah, as far as I know, Harvey's is still there.

00:37:16
iHeart Intro: Awesome. I don't know why over the past two weeks I've ever thought to look that.

00:37:20
Josh: Up me either. I'm almost positive we'll have to leave it to Aaron Hagar to tell us whether it's there or not.

00:37:27
iHeart Intro: Sweet it is. I'm looking at a picture of it. It's definitely been updated.

00:37:31
Josh: Well, while you're online, why don't you look at eBay and see if there's any like I got bombed at Harvey's T shirts still around?

00:37:38
iHeart Intro: Oh wow, Well, if there are, I'm not going to tell you. I'm just going to get you one for Christmas.

00:37:43
Josh: Fair enough. I like that a lot. That's a good plan. Well, since Chuck said but he's gonna get me for Christmas, and I realized, Man, I've got to figure out what to get Chuck for Christmas. It's time for listener mail.

00:37:55
iHeart Intro: You just got me a great record, which one.

00:37:59
Josh: Oh, the Bill Evans one. Yeah, yeah, you like it? Have you listened to it yet?

00:38:03
iHeart Intro: I love it? I mean a it's Bill Evans, but it's just uh yeah, it's good, very evocative of changing the seasons, which I think was the whole.

00:38:10
Josh: Point for sure. I'm glad you liked it.

00:38:13
iHeart Intro: All right, Hey, guys, After listening to the Introvert Extrovert episode, I thought i'd reach out because Chuck at one point talked about finding ways to discipline his child by removing fun activities. I remember saying that, but I guess.

00:38:30
Josh: Oh, you were so mad, You're like frothing at the mouth. I've never heard you more angry.

00:38:34
iHeart Intro: You don't even really do that, so I'm not sure if I may have been kidding or not. Anyway, I'm a third grade teacher because this is like a tip here, so we got to read the tips. I'm a third grade teacher on a reservation, and with sixteen kids in my class, I have never had to use discipline. My classroom functions like a well oiled machine. Due to a type of behavior management, known in the educational world as pbis positive behaviors and supports manage challenging child behavior solely, solely through the use of using praise and rewards. Wow, I can easily be applied in the context of raising your own.

00:39:10
Josh: Child, especially if you want to raise a psychopath.

00:39:15
iHeart Intro: This is a huge topic, and when there's near and dear to my heart, I thought it might be incredibly useful for all the parents out there who, like Chuck, struggle to find a way to manage their child's behavior. You convention your discipline.

00:39:26
Josh: Man, this guy's scoring all over you, Chuck.

00:39:29
iHeart Intro: A little bit. This is Anthony. You guys rock. Thanks for all the wonderful knowledge and Hilary's dialogue. I want to be super clear, Anthony, we don't struggle to find a way to manage her behavior. She's a good kid. And not to say that kids who have trouble behaving are bad kids at all. Everyone has their challenges as kids and parents. But it's not too bad. And I don't know that this pbis would work necessarily in my household. I mean, we already do that kind of thing, but I'll ramp it up and see if that helps.

00:40:05
Josh: Hey, good run an experiment, Chuck and true sysk fashion.

00:40:09
iHeart Intro: Sure. I'm curious though, because Anthony didn't say if Anthony had kids, I will say that the way kids behave for teachers is not at all related to how they behave for parents.

00:40:19
Josh: A lot of it I can imagine for sure.

00:40:21
iHeart Intro: So yeah, I'm curious.

00:40:23
Josh: Yeah, if you guys listening out there, try this, let us know if it works or what. And also, Anthony, thank you very much for writing in Anthony. It was great. So if you want to be like Anthony, you can write into to Stuff podcast at iHeartRadio dot com.
