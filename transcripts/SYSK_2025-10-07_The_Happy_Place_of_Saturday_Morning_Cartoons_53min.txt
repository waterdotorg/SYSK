================================================================================

00:00:01
iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:11
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, there's Chuck, there's Jerry, and we are practically perfect in every way here on Stuff you should Know.

00:00:20
iHeart Intro: That's right. I'm just a bill, only a bill.

00:00:24
Josh: Oh yeah, Well, have you ever been to Capitol Hill?

00:00:29
iHeart Intro: Oh? I'm just sitting here on Capitol Hill.

00:00:31
Josh: Do you remember we did a whole episode on Schoolhouse Rock once and you had Bob Nastanovitch.

00:00:37
iHeart Intro: John Yeah, a Pavement who. By the way, I finally met him in real life. Oh yeah, yeah. I was at a hard Quartet show, the New Supergroup with Matt Sweeney and Stephen Malkmus and Emmit Kelly and Jim White and in Atlanta and I turned around in the Bridy Playhouse lobby and Nastanovich comes strolling in and I was like, hey, man, I was like, uh, and I'm sure he gets hay Manned a lot, so he had he has, you know, his guard up. Actually he didn't. He was nice, but I was like, hey, I said, it's Chuck from Stuff you should Know. It's like good to finally meet you in person. And he He's like, oh, hey, man, and we chatted for a minute and it was great.

00:01:17
Josh: Oh that's cool. He remembered you.

00:01:18
iHeart Intro: Huh yeah, yeah, we've emailed and texted here and there.

00:01:21
Josh: Oh, gostcha. Well that's great, Chuck.

00:01:23
iHeart Intro: So that's my bobn Thestandovich story.

00:01:25
Josh: That's a great one. That's about as good as a Bobnistandovich story.

00:01:28
iHeart Intro: Get yeah. I mean I got to meet a pavement guy. So that was like the bucket list complete.

00:01:34
Josh: So I guess I guess I can't think of a segway from bucket list. I mean, I guess it would be an uncrossed off thing on my bucket list to build a time machine and go back to nineteen eighty three and watch Saturday morning cartoons again. How's that?

00:01:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah?

00:01:55
Josh: What I mean?

00:01:56
iHeart Intro: What was your routine in your house?

00:01:58
Josh: Oh?

00:01:58
iHeart Intro: Baby, yeah, let's hear.

00:02:01
Josh: I don't ever recall having to worry about my sisters trying to change the channel like it was Saturday morning cartoons. It was all me, yeah, oh okay morning. Yeah, it was great.

00:02:15
iHeart Intro: So they were watching.

00:02:17
Josh: No, Amanda's five years older than me, Karen was thirteen years older than me. Oh yeah, so she either one of them had much interested in Saturday morning cartoons when I did the interested and overlap.

00:02:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, we were close enough. Scott's three years older, Michelle six, so we overlapped a bit, and our routine was it was, you know, Saturday morning cartoons, but it was always a race to the big yellow chair to see who could claim that first.

00:02:42
Josh: That's you sat in a chair. I sat like three feet from the TV on the ground, cross leg in front of it.

00:02:47
iHeart Intro: Yeah, you were one of those guys. Yeah, for sure, because you weren't blocking anybody.

00:02:51
Josh: No, it was totally cool. It was just me. I love it yep with my et cereal.

00:02:57
iHeart Intro: Yeah, parents sleeping in Yep, for sure.

00:03:00
Josh: I Actually I can't say what anyone else in the house was doing during eight am to twelve pm every Saturday morning.

00:03:07
iHeart Intro: Yeah. I don't remember watching them, like the whole block, but maybe I did.

00:03:12
Josh: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I did. Except I know we've talked about it before. I don't remember what episode, but Thunder the Barbarian I would miss it. I would get to watch like the first seven eight minutes and then my mom would be like, it's time to leave for swimming lessons, and it was such a bummer. Yeah, and I know I've talked about it before on the show because a listener was so kind that they bought the complete series of Thunder the Barbarian and mailed it to me where that I could see it.

00:03:43
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah was it VHS?

00:03:47
Josh: No DVD? Man? They really they've styled me out, so thank you.

00:03:50
iHeart Intro: That's amazing.

00:03:52
Josh: So all right, let's get into this because I'm sure we're going to pepper our own favorite cartoons that we watched throughout this, right.

00:04:00
iHeart Intro: I might mention a cartoon or two, you never know.

00:04:02
Josh: Okay, I mean you were into this, right, like for years and years you spent Saturday mornings watching cartoons, right, Oh.

00:04:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, yeah, I mean, as you've reminded me over and over through our lives. I am a bit older than you, so there will be some overlap. But also, you know, as evidenced by like your love of like the Gi Joe stuff that was a little bit after when I was into that kind of thing. So there'll be some misses here and there too.

00:04:27
Josh: I'm sorry you left out the adjective superior Gi Joe stuff.

00:04:35
iHeart Intro: Yeah. This is a fun trip down memory lane though, and big thanks to Julia for this.

00:04:39
Josh: Yeah, for sure, So for those of you who were born after the mid nineties or even the early nineties, I guess because it took a few years to come to realize that there was such a thing as Saturday morning cartoons and then get into them, you might not really get what we're talking about. Maybe you've heard of Saturday morning cartoons, like exers love to talk about it all the time, clearly, but it was a very special thing, like a point in time every week where essentially every child in America and I've read also Australia had their own, the UK had their own to an extent, the Canada, other countries in Asia had like Saturday morning cartoons. And you came and you sat down and you watched four straight hours of cartoons, yeah, peppered with ads directed to you a five, six, seven, eight nine year old and loved life. And that was like your time in the week because like you said, parents tended to sleep in during that time. They were totally happy with their kids amusing themselves for the first four hours of the morning, watching TV and eating sugary cereal, and like it's there was a real loss when it went away, Like I was well out of watching Saturday more and cartoons by the.

00:06:00
iHeart Intro: Time we went away same.

00:06:02
Josh: But I remember feeling like a real like sense of like younger kids and like subsequent generations, like really missing out on something that we were in retrospect, really lucky to have.

00:06:14
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and you know, I'm sure the counter to that could be like, yeah, bruh, but we can watch anything we want, whenever we want, all the time, including Saturday morning. But and not to say like, oh, things were better then, but there was something special about a block when you didn't have choice like that, Yeah, dedicated to you, aim squarely at you for a certain amount of time, saying we see you, kids, and we want to sell you things.

00:06:44
Josh: It's true. Like when I read about, you know, just how shamefully bad the commercialism was in the eighties, I still am like, I don't I don't care. Like I loved all I loved every minute of it.

00:06:56
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and the commercials, this will see, we're not that much different than the content. And I saw this in action when when Ruby was younger and she would watch commercials with the same fervor. And I'll be like, yeah, I guess I did the same thing. You know.

00:07:11
Josh: I remember when we first started podcasting, with ads the whole the whole idea was, yeah, just all of a sudden start talking about the products, so no one gets that you're talking, you're giving an AD. And we were both like, we're not doing that at all. And that's where the idea for the the fan submitted jingles came about. Was to make sure everybody knew an AD is coming. We're not just suddenly going to start talking about how great Ore Casper Mattress is, you know.

00:07:36
iHeart Intro: Right, because I love cartoons and I love printer ink. Now that you mention it, yeah, I do too.

00:07:41
Josh: And you know, I've got one of those Epsen printers and they have like a tankless or a bottomless tank where you just refill the cartridges. You don't even have to go buy new cartridges, do they? Yeah, Epsin.

00:07:55
iHeart Intro: I wonder I people are going to suspect that's real and not a bit.

00:07:58
Josh: No, it's a bit.

00:07:58
iHeart Intro: Everybody should send you some though, you know. Yeah, But what we're talking about is a span of time of a few decades, about sixty five to two thousand ish, although you will see there was some one straggler at least beyond two thousand and cartoons had been around but they had mainly been in movie theaters, like they would play them before, Like you get to like a fancy movie theater and they'll be like an organ player and you would see a cartoon and maybe a newsreel. The first sort of regular running TV cartoon was something called Crusader Rabbit in nineteen fifty Yeah, just ran for a couple of years. But the first big breakout was the Mighty Mouse Playhouse. Mighty Mouse had been around since nineteen forty two, but it made its big Saturday morning television debut in nineteen fifty five on CBS.

00:08:47
Josh: Yeah, and that changed everything because prior to this, there was Saturday morning programming apparently all the way back to the days of radio. If you were a kid, you would tune in either after school or on Saturday mornings to hear your favorite program. So they were well aware that this is when kids listened and then eventually watched TV. But if you were a kid on Saturday morning, you're probably watching like some clubhouse style show where, yeah, some local dude who might or might not be dressed as a sag clown is interacting with puppets in the studio audience. It's nothing but kids, there's a single camera, it's produced by your local TV station, and like that's what you watch because they were so dirt cheap to make. And then when Mighty Mouse came along, it basically showed these things are maybe a little more expensive than that clubhouse style show, but they're way cheaper than like The Lone Ranger or Our Gang or some of the other stuff we're showing on Saturday mornings. And there's something else that's really really important to remember. We talked about it. I think in our political cartoons episode. Cartoons are a super stimuli. They hit our brains differently than watching Alfalfa or The Lone Ranger or that sag clown, who are live action, real life people. The kid is differently. They capture our attention differently, And so Mighty Mouse essentially showed like, hey, you want to like get into a kid's brain and sell them stuff, Yeah, this is the way to do it. Cartoons are the wave of the future.

00:10:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, way do you get a load of droopy?

00:10:18
Josh: Droopy was great, wasn't they.

00:10:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, although I don't remember stuff like that Saturday morning, I remember stuff like Droopy more of like afternoon after school kind of hours. But cartoons became a big deal shortly after they hit the small screen and in nineteen sixty and this is one of those little weird factoids that I think some people might not realize is that Flintstones is actually a primetime show. A lot of people do know that, but a lot of people don't. So was The Bugs Bunny Show at first, the Jetsons and the New Adventures of Johnny Quest. They were all primetime you know, major network, which is to say, either ABC, CBS or NBC. This is pre Fox. Even there were only three and not too long after nineteen sixty seven was when they said, you know what, we got to consolidate all this stuff to Saturday morning. And that was it. It was a new thing. And like you said, it was pretty cheap to make, especially, I mean some of the cartoons were better than others. There were some that were really cheap and kind of poorly made, where like just the mouths moved and stuff like that. And it was the same person voicing every character like kind of clearly. And they were like, Hey, what we can do here is we've got these kids. We got this captive audience, tons and tons of kids named Josh Clark, sitting three feet in front of their TV Chris Cross Apple sauce, and that means we can sell them toys and sugar.

00:11:42
Josh: Yes, And they were already doing this, I mean those clubhouse style TVs. The guy would do like what the original podcast ads were supposed to, just suddenly be talking about a brand new toy that he loves. Right, yeah, right, So they've been doing this before, but again, cartoons, they just were operating on a different plane. And I think nineteen sixty six was a pivotal year according to I found a pretty good article about this by a guy named Paul FP. Pogue It's great name on encyclopedia dot com, and he basically says nineteen sixty six was the It was the year because that was the first year where all three networks showed cartoon blocks on Saturday mornings, and from that moment on until I would argue the late nineties, really he was a golden age for cartoons on Saturday mornings.

00:12:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And you you know, you didn't have a DVRs or TVO or anything like that to record stuff. Obviously, you didn't really even have VCRs to record things. You probably just had the one TV at least until kind of mid to late seventies is when multiple TVs really started showing up a little bit more unless you were, you know, like the rich kid, and so you had to figure out in debate with your siblings if they were around, what to watch by reading most you know a lot of people got TV Guide, but we did not pay for that because we didn't pay for extra things in our family.

00:13:07
Josh: Sure, but you know, we.

00:13:08
iHeart Intro: Had the local paper which had the TV listings, and so you pour through some made arguments that you know, it had kids reading on Saturday morning as a result, and you would, you know, sometimes there were real Sophie's choices to be made on what to watch.

00:13:21
Josh: Right and the reason why. And this is what's hard to understand if you're like gen Z or even like a late millennial. There was no choice in what you were watching. When you said on Saturday mornings, the networks that you were watching were showing you the shows that they decided they wanted to run. So a show you watched was on a specific time, on a specific network on a specific day, in this case Saturday morning. So you just sat down and I think there was something about not having that choice that made it even more enjoyable so long as the stuff was good.

00:14:01
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean they were serving us exactly what we wanted. I never had any complaints, did you No.

00:14:05
Josh: The only complaint I had that I didn't have three TVs that I could watch. Yeah, them all at the same time, or even better sequentially.

00:14:12
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And while this was all, you know, kind of fun and games are not all fun and games mostly fun and games, there are people out there, you know, kind of smarty pants, people who have made arguments for things like, Hey, it introduced a new generation to the Beatles, because I certainly remember watching that Beatles cartoon when I was a kid. Oh yeah, Yeah. I came out in sixty five, but by you know, it was still running somewhere because I watched it, and that's where I kind of got my love of the Beatles. It introduced kids to, you know, concepts like what might happen in the future with the Jetsons. There's a historian named Joel Rhodes who said that the cartoons perform what the scholars call the bardic function. Yeah, as in like medieval bards and people would sit around and listen to the stories and it would give kids on the playground, like they knew the same jokes, they had same reference points. It bonded a generation.

00:15:01
Josh: Because they were all watching the same thing on the same day at the same time. So, yes, that was the culture for kids. That's where you got your culture largely, I mean not entirely. There was Mad Magazine after all, right, but like that, that was because there wasn't choice, because you couldn't be like, hey, have you seen Black Dub No, I haven't seen that, but have you seen Time Crimes? It's a great right, Like those conversations didn't happen. It was some kid yelled out like exit stage left. Every kid on the playground just cracked up because they knew exactly what they were talking about. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, just look up cartoon exit stage left.

00:15:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's right, it was that snaggle buss. Yes, okay, I get some of those confused sometimes.

00:15:47
Josh: Now you nailed it, but you nailed We also.

00:15:51
iHeart Intro: Uh hammered this home in the Schoolhouse Rock episode. But we do have to mention that how pivotal school House Rock was and literally teaching kids things about history and about politics and civics and government and math and English like you name it. It was all there and like real learning, like legitimate awesome learning, awesome stuff.

00:16:13
Josh: Yeah, that was a good episode. I remember I cracked myself up and we almost like had to take our younger break. Yeah, if I remember correctly.

00:16:22
iHeart Intro: Do you remember the joke?

00:16:23
Josh: I think I did some weird impression of Chuck Jones the Loony Tunes guy.

00:16:29
iHeart Intro: Oh man, I gotta listen to this one now.

00:16:31
Josh: Yeah, maybe we.

00:16:32
iHeart Intro: Should put Schoolhouse Rock as our select on Saturday. Oh that's a great idea when this one comes out, the idea.

00:16:37
Josh: Yeah, that's a that's a wonderful idea.

00:16:39
iHeart Intro: Chunk Jerry, make a note of that. And then now I'm doing the flintstones hammering something into a stone tablet.

00:16:48
Josh: I looked up The Great Kazoo because anytime I hear Flintstones, I think Great Kazoo. Yeah, and did you know he was He was an alien who was banished from his planet for creating a doomsday device.

00:17:02
iHeart Intro: I don't remember that part.

00:17:03
Josh: I didn't either.

00:17:04
iHeart Intro: I remember him floating around, but yeah, that's right.

00:17:06
Josh: And being extremely condescending.

00:17:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, it's a real George dum Shall we take a break yeah, let's take a break, all right. Whenever you call me a dumb dumb that means I have to go reset. We'll be right.

00:17:18
Josh: Back, Chuck. There was one other thing that, one other place you could find out what was running at what time on what network, Saturday Morning Cartoons. It was the annual ad, full page ad in the comic books in the fall that announced like the Saturday Morning Cartoons line up.

00:17:57
iHeart Intro: Yes, huh, I didn't know that.

00:17:59
Josh: Yeah, well, I was going to say, go look them up because they're very nostalgic, but they're just awesome. They're just so great, and they would tell you what time it was on and then it was all starting in two short weeks and you just couldn't wait.

00:18:12
iHeart Intro: Well, and how sweet that you could publish a one time thing and that was the lineup.

00:18:17
Josh: Right, Like, it's not changing, no, for sure, although apparently they would change lineups in spring for shows that weren't working, but more often than not you were seeing largely the same shows.

00:18:29
iHeart Intro: Yeah, so yeah, I remember that's when things would change sort of mid season. That was always disconcerting.

00:18:36
Josh: Yeah. And one other thing I just barely touched on. It was there was a subtext to it all this started right after summer ended, so you had all summer to have a great time. Summer stops, school starts, and then Saturday Morning Cartoon kicks off a new season.

00:18:52
iHeart Intro: Oh man, I love it. The fall TV season. So we mentioned advertising. This is going to be a big part of this episode because it really goes and lockstep with Saturday Morning Cartoons and all children's programming of all time. But at one point, you know, like I mentioned, they realized they had a captive audience. They could sell them toys and sugar. But the lines started to blur in the nineteen seventies between content and advertising in such a way it was sort of like the beginning of In fact, I'm curious when that people started using words like IP intellectual property, because now we would just call it IP. Back then, it was like, hey, we got the Jackson five, they are a successful musical group. Let's give them a cartoon. We got the Osmond's kids, love the Brady Bunch, Let's do the Brady Bunch kids. We got the Flintstones, Hey, let's give them a cereal. And things started just kind of crossing streams such where yeah, like we would just call that IP today, it's like, let's take a thing and exploit it in as many different ways and sell it in as many different ways as we can.

00:19:55
Josh: Right, yes, exactly. They were cartoons starting, like you said, the seventies became marketing tools, and at first it was to basically extend the advertising power of an existing TV show, like all the ones you listed right and more. Yeah, But then they started saying, like, hey, we have this line of greeting cards. The care Bears started out as a greeting cards line, so did shirt Pales as a matter of fact. Yeah, And they would say, like, people are going crazy for these mugs with these adorable characters on them, because care Bears did have the loveliest animation potentially of all time of all Saturday Morning cartoons.

00:20:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think so.

00:20:34
Josh: And then they said, Okay, mugs are not enough, Greeting cards are not enough. Let's like really blow out this ip if they were calling it that, and turn it into a kids show and then start selling like dolls and figures of these cartoons to the kids watching these shows. And you could take something like the care Bears as a greeting card line and turn them into a hot property.

00:20:59
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean we'll read through a few of these. That was a pac Man TV show of course, that was good, which was an arcade game. Of course. There was a Dungeons and Dragons cartoon that was pretty good role playing game. I don't think I ever saw that there was let me see here, obviously the Transformers, yeah, long before they were not so great Michael Bay movies. They were toys and then a cartoon. And as you'll see, some of these things kind of it's hard to remember which one came before the other or if they were like developing toys just to sell a cartoon or developing a cartoon just to sell toys. It kind of except for you know, Rambo and Chuck Norris, which were actual shows in nineteen eighty six, Rambo The Force of Freedom and Chuck Norris Karate Commandos Double K. I think the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was the one that started out as a show just to sell the.

00:21:52
Josh: Toys, right, Yeah, they were basically co developed at the same time. Was part of a grand scheme. I know. Jim and the Holograms was a cartoon before the toys, about a year before the toys. Okay, there were Smurfs when the Smurfs came out, that was a big deal. Yeah, because there was there was like was it one hundred or one hundred and one Smurf with Papa Smurf, and they made little like really collectable size action r well not action figures because they weren't action at all, but just little figures of the Smurf. You remember those, Yeah, you could smurf them all And yes, exactly, I'm pretty sure they had like a hundred different ones that you could collect, and people went bonkers on those things because they were just so cute and you could put them on your desk or you could play with them or do whatever. If the Smurfs came first, and I think that they really kind of helped kick off that genuine like we can really market the heck out of these cartoons if we make figures based on these.

00:22:51
iHeart Intro: Yeah, see that that's a slight divide. I was a little bit old for Smurfs, a little bit old for Smurfs.

00:22:57
Josh: Full stop Smurfs is still pretty good.

00:23:00
iHeart Intro: Hey, they're still making those movies. Man, those one out last year, wasn't there.

00:23:03
Josh: I have not seen you mean, like the CGI movies. Yeah, yeah, I've not seen them. But yeah, I think they've got several out.

00:23:10
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think it's the same thing. They're still smurfing at the box office.

00:23:13
Josh: That's great. And then there were other ones like Strawberry Shortcake, My Little Pony. Well, like you said, the lines between did the cartoon come first, did the toys come first, it really doesn't matter because they were all part of the same package. By this point were well into the eighties, which not coincidentally was the deregulation minded Reagan era, and cartoons at this point had evolved into half hour essentially commercials for the actual toy, and in the most pronounced cases, the actual commercials were for the toys in the cartoon that the toys were based on.

00:23:53
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I've got some stats here because in the late seventies of the FTC, and we're going to talk about the FCC and the FDC quite a bit, because parents and the government started to get a little upset. Basically, they saw the writing on the wall, and in late seventies they released numbers by the FTC that highlighted what they called it like a real health problem for this programming companies every year and this was back then in the seventies, spent five hundred to six hundred million dollars on ads targeted to children. Of all the foods being advertised to kids, two thirds, I'm surprised it wasn't more than this, honestly were highly sugared products.

00:24:35
Josh: It was by my Josh math calculations, it was over ninety five percent.

00:24:40
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that feels about right.

00:24:41
Josh: Yeah, for real, because of all the foods. But even of all the ads, chuck, most of them were first sugared foods. There was a study or that Trade Commission study looked at some data that looked at nine months of nineteen seventy five nine even the whole year looked at seven five hundred and fifteen ads. Seven and eighty two of those ads were for sugary foods ninety five point seven percent.

00:25:11
iHeart Intro: Was there anything for good food? Uh?

00:25:13
Josh: Yes? Actually there were four four ads over nine months, four different ads for meats, vegetables, milk or cheese, and cheese. And I think meats maybe had zero, so vegetables somehow was basically carrying that. And I would guess all four of those were different V eight ads or fruit juice ads.

00:25:36
iHeart Intro: Who was the guy? It was like the the dairy counsel or something. The guy that danced around and sang about cheese.

00:25:44
Josh: I think it was uh time for Timer. Was he like a big circle with real long, skinny legs in the That was Timer?

00:25:53
iHeart Intro: Okay, yeah, that was what was? That? Was that the dairy Council.

00:25:56
Josh: I know. He was actually a respect to the government actually doing something in the late seventies, which we'll talk about, which was so he's a good days to kind of counteract this stuff. Yeah, it was a good thing.

00:26:10
iHeart Intro: Okay.

00:26:10
Josh: He talked about eating proteins and stuff rather than sugar.

00:26:14
iHeart Intro: God, what a very weird He looks like Twinkie the Kid a little bit.

00:26:17
Josh: Yeah. I couldn't put my finger on it. Chuck, You're absolutely right, that's who it was, all right.

00:26:22
iHeart Intro: So the writing's on the wall. These studies are coming out and people are saying, like, really, four ads for good food and seven thousand plus for sugary stuff, and so people started getting upset, not just about the ads though, but about the content. Cartoon violence is a real thing. Every time that was an adult in a cartoon, they were buffoons and morons.

00:26:41
Josh: Or they had like an evil plot that the kids had to foil.

00:26:45
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, like they were bad people like Scooby Doo kids were. They were always foiling the adults evil plan exactly. They were never going against fellow whatever. I mean, how old were they even.

00:26:55
Josh: They were late teens, maybe even for those high school Yeah, I think they were bumming around to college. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it was right before college.

00:27:04
iHeart Intro: Okay. Consumerism, of course was very much glorified in the cartoons and the ads, and by the late sixties, you know, jumping back a bit, there were there were groups that were forming The Action for Children's Television got together, there were lobbying the FCC. Obviously they regulate the media on not cable as we'll see, but just regular TV. And they were saying like, hey, this is this stuff is we got to pull this back some like we're getting out of hand with what we're feeding children four hours at a time every Saturday.

00:27:35
Josh: Yeah. Yeah, this was, like you said, the late sixties. It started to really kind of pick up in the seventies because the reason why is more and more research was funded studying what effect television had on kids, and Saturday morning cartoons were a deep focus of those studies too. There was a nineteen seventy five study from the National Science Foundation. It was a metas funny analysis. Yeah, yeah, and they said, Saturday morning cartoons are creating conflict within families because kids are going to their parents saying I want this, the parents say no, and then the kid gets upset and starts arguing in that. Yeah, that's internal family conflict. Familial conflict. And this same one of the surveys found that kids, I think a third of kids reported arguing sometimes when their parents said no, Six of them argued quote a lot. So the reason why Saturday morning cartoons in particular were causing this conflict is because there were so many ads for so many kids products that kids saw every Saturday that it increased the frequency of kids asking for stuff, which increased the frequency of being told no, which increased the frequency of arguing in conflict.

00:28:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. Parents didn't like that. Of course, they also didn't like that. They learned that and they did you know, studies on this too, and they found that young kids or kids in general, basically couldn't tell the difference between cartoons and ads because sometimes it was the literal characters from the cartoons selling you something. Sometimes it was kids playing with toys and showing you the action of the toys and kids just love watching that. And the old you know, the younger you were, you really couldn't tell the difference. Once you got a little bit older, you could tell the difference just by the link and be like, well, those are the short cartoons.

00:29:25
Josh: Right exactly. Yeah, because these ads were all like there would be a mini cartoon within the ad, you know, like Frank and Berry would almost fall into a pit or something like that. Count Chocula would have to come turn into a bat and rescue them or something like that, and then they both end up eating their cereal. That Like, if you're a little kid, you're like, this is great. This is some weird short that they just put in the middle of the show.

00:29:51
iHeart Intro: But it's not an ad, and I'm hungry all of a sudden for that cereal.

00:29:56
Josh: Mom, I want some Count Chocula.

00:29:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:29:59
Josh: That was actually apctured really well in a Simpsons just this almost in a side where Itching and Scratchy are up for a cartoon award and one of the other one of the other cartoons in the running for Best Writing in a Cartoon Series was Action Figure Man. The How to Buy Action Figure Man episode where it just shows the little kid and goes, Mommy, I want it. He's pointing to the action vase, like not even an ad that was the episode.

00:30:28
iHeart Intro: That's really funny.

00:30:29
Josh: Yeah, they nailed it on that. They nailed it like snaggle Puss.

00:30:32
iHeart Intro: They always do. So the long and short of all of this past few minutes is that kids didn't know that they were being sold things right, and parents didn't like that. I think the authors of the paper were fairly kind when they said, certainly, most advertisers do not deliberately set out to confuse or mislead children, nor to promote unsafe, unhealthier, social, socially undesirable behavior, which was very naive I think. But maybe they were just trying to soft sell it.

00:31:00
Josh: Right, So you put all this together that again started in the sixties, is kind of agitation. And also this is where this is the climate that Sesame Street grew out of and probably made Saturday morning cartoons look even worse because it showed you could make kids shows that didn't poison their minds. And then it picked up in the seventies and by nineteen seventy eight, the Federal Trade Commission said, hey, we need to do something about this. We're not going to do anything about it, but we're going to make some recommendations. Through their staff report on television advertising to children, they said, we should ban all television advertising for any product whatsoever that's directed at very young children.

00:31:38
iHeart Intro: That's a big one, right, so you can kiss.

00:31:41
Josh: My buddy goodbye. Right, ban advertising directed to older children for sugar products, which makes sense. But the thing they predicated this concern on just cracks me up, because those things can pose serious dental health risks. Like that was the extent of the concern with sugary products back then.

00:31:59
iHeart Intro: Yeah, could rat your tea, right, yeah, I mean that's what you heard. That'll write your teeth, not like just eating tons of sugar is not good for you.

00:32:05
Josh: Right. I remember having like a we did a module that included a play and some other stuff in third grade that was sponsored by Crest. There's a big Crest like cutout stand up and like we just in class, we just did this whole thing about brushing your teeth with Crest brand toothpaste. It was like that pervasive.

00:32:25
iHeart Intro: We make holes and teeth. Do you remember that?

00:32:28
Josh: Yeah? I do, but I can't place it.

00:32:30
iHeart Intro: It was oh man, I mean, I think it was Crest, but it was again a cartoon that Crest was running, and it was the cavity something that they had to fight, and that was what they would chant, we make holes and teeth.

00:32:45
Josh: Yeah, that might have been one of the things that kicked this off.

00:32:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, probably so. And then the final requirement was advertisements directed to older kids for other sugar products that they could you know, put TV would be balanced by ads for other nutritional products or health disclosures at the end of the sugar product ad.

00:33:09
Josh: That's where Timer came from.

00:33:11
iHeart Intro: Yeah, okay, I gotcha.

00:33:12
Josh: That's also where bod Squad came from. Don't drown your food, remember that one. Oh yeah, there was the cool thing about Schoolhouse Rock is they'd already been doing this for half a decade by the time other networks started to do something about it by running these cute little cartoon PSAs. So essentially they were ten to fifteen maybe up to thirty second commercials that the networks had to run that were cartoons too, So they appealed the kids, but they rather than telling kids to buy fruity pebbles, they were telling kids to brush your teeth or to exercise your chompers with things like carrots and apples, that kind of stuff.

00:33:51
iHeart Intro: Right, should we take a break.

00:33:54
Josh: Let's talk about the rest of these. There's some other stuff that you just kind of take for granted. I didn't realize came out of an actual deal between the networks and the FTC.

00:34:04
iHeart Intro: Yeah, there was also and all this stuff I didn't remember necessarily in the moment, but once I started reading about it and studying it and obviously watching on YouTube, it like washed over me. NBC had one to grow on from eighty three to eighty nine, and that was just usually some famous person sort of giving some life lesson advice and they'd be like, well, that's one to grow on. H what else weld? Nancy Reagan of course, and just say no to drugs. You can forget that.

00:34:31
Josh: Yeah. Betty White taught you who to call in an emergency.

00:34:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah, called Betty White, right exactly.

00:34:37
Josh: Because Betty White could handle basically anything. She was just that kind of person. There was also the more you know, with the star that went over your head. That was the nineties on NBC and all of the NBC stars at the time, because remember NBC ruled the airwaves. Yeah, must see TV Thursdays.

00:34:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Yeah, they had.

00:34:56
Josh: Their stars basically doing thirty second spots which are PSA and about how to, how to you know, maybe get into teaching, maybe stay in school, just little life lessons like that. There were a bunch actually about abusive parents and how not cool it was for a dad to beat up on a mom. Oh yeah yeah, real like kind of rugging and raw stuff here there, but presented in these vignettes that kind of got through to kids, although you can tell they were geared towards slightly older kids.

00:35:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And then of course you're beloved. G I Joe talked about stranger danger and always finished with the famous line, now you know and knowing is half the battle.

00:35:37
Josh: And you've seen those parody videos of that before, right, I don't think so. Oh there's about thirty or so maybe more parody videos that are just totally off the wall but hilarious where they just take out the sound and put in their own sound and vocals and edit the stuff up, kind of mix it up so that they're just it's just amazing. Look up g I Joe PSA parody videos and you'll thank.

00:36:02
iHeart Intro: Me later, or just watch probably any episode of the family guy. Yeah, probably, he did a lot of this stuff.

00:36:09
Josh: Yeah, he did.

00:36:10
iHeart Intro: Shall we take a break, yes, all right, we'll be right back with more on Saturday Morning cartoons. All right. Oh, by the way, I remembered it was the Cavity Creeps.

00:36:41
Josh: Oh great memory, Yeah, it just pop back.

00:36:45
iHeart Intro: So before we left, we talked about, you know, some of these things they were doing to offset the effect of cartoons. It's called pro social programming, and it came about because of an actual deal that was made. There was an FTC hearing in nineteen seventy eight where Kenneth of Quaker Oats was up there because you know, they're like, hey, Captain Crunch is rotting our kid's teeth out and you make it. And he actually like he didn't think they were the problem. He thought the content was the problem. But he did come out and had a statement basically where like he said, you know, I think we do need to change what's going on in our cartoons and change the way our society is using this medium to communicate with kids. So it took a lot of nerve, I think for that guy to say that, But he didn't blame the ads like I said. So they struck a deal. Basically, hey, you can keep these ads if you add this other programming that we were talking about before.

00:37:41
Josh: Yeah, and apparently the way that I took it, it was a very crafty thing to do by blaming the content because it took the onus off the sugary product. Advertisers and everybody started looking at the cartoons themselves, and the cartoons were probably like, hey, hey, we're not nearly as bad as fruity pebbles, but okay, we'll start doing something about it. The I guess cartoons themselves started to get a little more pro social, like this is where fad Albert came from, I believe. But then also those PSAs that we were talking about, that was the advent of them.

00:38:14
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, but this is late seventies. I think that was seventy seven seventy eight. Ronald Reagan would come along in the nineteen eighties and sort of just deregulate the United States as a whole and said, FCC stand down and don't worry about this stuff. They didn't officially, I mean, there were recommendations anyways, and not laws. So a recommendation is only good if you sort of follow up on that, and the FCC started not to in the eighties, they kind of didn't try in some cases. I think between nineteen eighty and nineteen ninety they actually saw a rise in the number of violent acts per hour on Saturday morning cartoons from eighteen point six to twenty six point four per hour.

00:38:55
Josh: Which is pretty nuts. But it gets even more nuts when you compare it to what was on prime time, what the adults were watching. Oh yeah, between nineteen eighty and nineteen ninety, it pretty much held steady at just five to six acts of violence per hour as opposed to the twenty six per hour on cartoons.

00:39:13
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and you know, it's cartoon violence, but it's still it's not all Roadrunner falling off a cliff like a lot of it was, you know, depicted, like you know, there was a Rambo cartoon like I mentioned, right.

00:39:26
Josh: Yeah, but there there is research. And I'm not taking a position on either way because people have said, like violent video games caused violence, right violent, this is like the predecessor to all that stuff, violent cartoons caused violent kids. One of the I guess arguments of that is that even if it was cartoon violence like Roadrunner, it still desensitized kids to the consequences of violent acts, right because there was accompanied with humor.

00:39:51
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. So the eighties were kind of the most unchecked time, it seems like. Yeah, and the nineties come along and finally they were like, all right, we got to do something. Congress steps back in and the Children's Television Act of nineteen ninety required the FCC to enforce those original FTC's recommendations in nineteen seventy eight and said, you got to reinstate restrictions on advertising during children's television and enforce the obligations of broadcasters to meet the educational informational needs of the child audience. And a couple of years later, NBC was like, all right, I'm done, it's not even worth it anymore.

00:40:28
Josh: Get this. Yeah. Although one good thing that came out of this is this was the origin of Saved by the Bell because NBC went all in on slightly older kids team programming on Saturday mornings, and the flagship of it was Saved by the Bell so much they shoot they showed two episodes of it Mourning New Ones.

00:40:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah. I mean, this is also where you got things like the Mighty morphin Power Rangers, and of course pee Wee's Playhouse was a little bit before this, or was it in the nineties.

00:40:57
Josh: Was that the German pronunciation? Did I say pee Wee's play Hoss?

00:41:02
iHeart Intro: Did I p's PV's play House?

00:41:06
Josh: Perfect? Yeah? I think that was like eighty five or something like that.

00:41:11
iHeart Intro: Okay, I never watched pee Wee's Playhouse. I know we talked about this, but I guess I was fourteen by then, not that you I mean there. I could watch it today and probably really love it because pee Wee defies age groups. But it was just one of those things that maybe at the time I didn't know about it and didn't think it was for me or something. I don't know, I have no excuse.

00:41:29
Josh: Yeah. I wasn't into him either for sure. But I did get to see his live version of the pee Wee's Playhouse.

00:41:36
iHeart Intro: Oh you went to that?

00:41:37
Josh: Yeah?

00:41:38
iHeart Intro: Amazing.

00:41:39
Josh: So there were a few other consequences of this, but the big one, the upshot, was that the government Congress essentially nanny stated Saturday morning cartoons out of existence. Yeah, because of these rules, they just weren't profitable anymore. There were certain restrictions on advertising. You could only show so many ads during kids programming like there was. There was just a lot that took away the profit drive that made Saturday morning cartoons so attractive, right, Yeah, there were a lot of other factors too that put the writing on the wall, not the least of which was the rise of cable TV, which you mentioned was outside of the purview of the FCC for a long time, and from what I could tell, even today, networks are required to show three hours of educational programming geared toward geared to kids. So if you ever are up on a Saturday or a Sunday and you were watching say By the Bell reruns like I don't know some people do, it would say it would flash like a logo that says EI, and it would say this program has been labeled educational and informative. That's because of the government mandate that they have to run three hours of shows educational shows. I guess a day, maybe maybe a week, because I only remember seeing it on certain times of certain days. But there were mandates that said you have to show educational programming, and that's why you see that today. But Cable that didn't apply to and so not only did Cable not have to show and take up valuable real estate with educational programming that nobody wanted to watch unless it was saved by the bell. There were also cable networks that were geared exclusively two kids. That wasn't just on Saturday mornings. These were twenty four hour a day children's programmings like Nickelodeon in the beginning, the first iteration of the Disney Channel.

00:43:39
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and stuff like the WB and CW two. Those weren't exclusively kids, but I feel like most of that was, and like through teen years, basically you also had the rise of like even though I love my Atari and stuff like that, it wasn't anything like what was to come with at home gaming. That certainly put a dent in things because now kid could just get up on Saturday morning and play whatever. You know, new system was out, DBRs came along, and then, you know, so you didn't have to crowd around the TV at a certain time. Together. They all just started getting out of it. I think I mentioned NBC got out in ninety two, CBS got out in ninety seven, and ABC Wow. ABC hung on to Saturday morning cartoons till twenty ten.

00:44:25
Josh: Yeah, yep, for sure.

00:44:27
iHeart Intro: Bad No.

00:44:28
Josh: I think WB and Fox had only stopped just a couple of years before. But again, it seems like the whole thing peaked and ended by the late nineties, very early two thousands. And from what I saw, the last Saturday Morning cartoon block shown in the United States happened on September twenty seventh, twenty fourteen, on the CW. And the last cartoon show that was shown in the history of Saturday Morning cartoons was Yu Gi Oh Zexol, which is nothing I was ever into, but I know there are a lot of kids who just like drooled with nostalgia. And that was the last Saturday Morning cartoon ever shown. There's a little piece of trivia for you.

00:45:13
iHeart Intro: Wow did they did they have a lone bugler play taps afterward?

00:45:18
Josh: They should have? For sure?

00:45:20
iHeart Intro: Man, what a what an end of an era? For sure?

00:45:22
Josh: Yeah. But it also I mean when I look back or look at all of this info, and I'm like, I was smack dab in the most manipulative stretch of Saturday Morning cartoons. Yeah, and it makes me wonder, like what had I been watching in the early seventies, or had I been watching in the nineties or two thousands. After like all of these restrictions, How different would would I be?

00:45:47
iHeart Intro: Yeah?

00:45:49
Josh: Yeah, Like I can recite a specific fruity pebbles ad that they used to show around Christmas. Yeah, now, yes, So I think Fred no Barney was pretending to be Santa because he wanted to slide down the chimney and get Fred's fruity pebbles and he said ho ho ho, I'm hungry. And then he slid down and he found Sana was already there and he goes, Sanna, my pebbles, and Fred goes your pebbles, Barney. And this would like get in my head as an earworm, and it does still sometimes today where like for days it'll just be going on a loop in my head.

00:46:28
iHeart Intro: That's so funny.

00:46:29
Josh: And I can even top that chuck. Okay, As I was thinking about it today, I was highlighting, like my notes for today and I started drooling. So like that's how that's the Pavlovian response that was teen to me for fruity pebbles thanks from the Morning cartoons in the air.

00:46:48
iHeart Intro: Oh I love frddy pebbles. Not as good as Captain Crunch Peanut butter to me, that's my all time favorite. But boy, I love some prudy pebbles.

00:46:54
Josh: Did you ever have that Etty cereal that I mentioned earlier?

00:46:57
iHeart Intro: I don't think I ever had that. I mean we didn't good, we weren't. You know, we didn't get a lot of that stuff.

00:47:03
Josh: If you could afford cap'n Crunch peanut butter, you could afford Et.

00:47:07
iHeart Intro: Yeah, but Captain Crunched peanut butter was a rarity, and oftentimes it was the the generic brands of all that stuff. So instead of fruity petals, it was like fruit stones or whatever.

00:47:19
Josh: Fruit tonsilstones.

00:47:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, exactly gross.

00:47:22
Josh: Yeah. Yeah. As far as peanut butter cereals, go Et was the best. I think.

00:47:26
iHeart Intro: Oh it was peanut butter, yes, And it was.

00:47:28
Josh: Not peanut butter and chocolate. It was just peanut butter because remember Riese's pieces were ET's face. Oh of course candy. And it had like a glossy coating to it too that somehow maybe even more sweet peanut butter. It was so good.

00:47:41
iHeart Intro: Was it uh ET's head or something?

00:47:46
Josh: No, I don't remember what it was, but it was I don't I don't think it was. Were they and teas? I'm not sure?

00:47:52
iHeart Intro: Just ask if it was eas and teas.

00:47:54
Josh: It may have been, but on the box it was obviously just a big picture of et.

00:47:59
iHeart Intro: I bet you they could bring that back and people would like it.

00:48:03
Josh: I would buy all of it.

00:48:05
iHeart Intro: I think it I'm looking now, Buddy, I think it's eas and teas.

00:48:08
Josh: It's so good, Chuck. It was so good that. And remember the lemon lime bubble Yum where it was like a lemon center wrapped in lime outside. Yeah, those two things are like. That was the pinnacle of my childhood as far as eating stuff goes.

00:48:24
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I was a great Hubba Bubba guy generally. I found that they had the best tensile strength for the biggest bubbles, for sure, but I would also do Hubba Bubba or Bubbleicious and bubble Yum too.

00:48:35
Josh: Yep. Yeah, bubble Yum probably had the least bubble blowing ability. Hubba Bubba definitely had everybody else beat.

00:48:43
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:48:44
Josh: One last question. Did you have a license plate that you got out of a honeycomb box that you put on your bike?

00:48:50
iHeart Intro: Oh? You bet, your sweet Bippy, I get.

00:48:53
Josh: Me too, buddy. Yeah, I don't remember what it said, but I'll bet it was bitchin and pro America.

00:48:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I didn't even like Honey Cereal, so that they got you to buy stuff just because you wanted to the prize.

00:49:03
Josh: That's awesome. And I'm sure you learned all about the license plate being in the box of Honeycombs on Saturday Morning cartoons.

00:49:10
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and man, the nostalgia's coming hard now. But if you weren't sitting down for Saturday Morning cartoons, you would just have your bowl in front of you. Of course, if you're at the kitchen table eating cereal, what were you doing.

00:49:23
Josh: Reading the back of the cereal box? You got it so good, which is probably another ad for something else too.

00:49:30
iHeart Intro: Yeah, or like a puzzle or a word find or something.

00:49:34
Josh: Yeah, if you're lucky. Yeah, we should probably stop because I'm getting dizzy about a faint.

00:49:40
iHeart Intro: I'm drooling now.

00:49:42
Josh: If you want to know more about Saturday Morning cartoons, I have a great little piece of advice for you. Some saintly humans have put entire three four hour blocks Saturday Morning Cartoons, complete with ads, the original broadcasts on YouTube and all sorts of other video play sights. And if you want to just lose yourself, go watch some of it. You will love it. Amazing, Chuck said, amazing, which means it's time for listener mail.

00:50:12
iHeart Intro: I'm gonna call this gross's cockroach story. Ever. Hey, guys, not to be a one upper, but I believe I might have the worst cockroach story on Earth.

00:50:19
Josh: Yikes.

00:50:20
iHeart Intro: A few years ago, I would let my little three legged best friend Trip. I guy, he's got a little tripod dog. I love those mm hm out on the front porch because he loves laying on the porch at night to listen to the bugs. He's the best dog one could dream for. But on this night, he let me down for the first time ever for not protecting me as I opened the door to let him out. As I turned around to walk back inside, I felt something hit my head and start crawling. Quickly ripped off my hoodie and threw it to the ground. I searched and search but ultimately couldn't find the culprit. After a few minutes of searching, I decided to open the front door to see if Trip wanted to come back in. Right as I began to call out for him to come inside, a roach the size of a Mulano cookie buzzed around from inside the house and flew directly into my mouth. Oh my goodness, yes, all the way into my mouth. I quickly spit it out and tried my best to smash this thing into oblivion. But Saliba only made him stronger, I guess, as he evaded me with ease and flew off into the warm summer night sky. I think about this far too often, and wouldn't doubt if it only added to my ongoing anxiety. He had mentioned at the beginning that we help with anxiety for Buck so and that his wife appreciates that. So part of the reason for Buck's anxiety might be recounting this roach story for real. Again, Thank you, guys for the years of joy, knowledge, and last, may your mouths be free of paraplanita Americana for forever and longer.

00:51:41
Josh: Nice. Thanks Buck. That's a good email.

00:51:44
iHeart Intro: Yeah, good writer.

00:51:45
Josh: I can image, Yeah, I can imagine that there are some people out there listening that are like, what does he mean a flying cockroach? Yes, indeed there are flying cockroach. Yeah, cam palmetto bugs, and they're giant and they're flying, and their cockroaches and apparently if your Buck and you got your mouth though open, a milano sized cookie cockroach is going to find his way right into that gaping hole horrific. I think I already said thanks again, Buck, but that was such a good email it's worth saying again. So thanks again, Buck. And if you want to be like Buck and send us an email, send it off to stuff podcast at iHeartRadio dot com.
