Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh, and Chuck's here, and Jerry's here, and we're all here, and this is short stuff with even more talk on cremins. You thought we were done with talking cremains. We're not done talking cremains. Don't you remember cremains is offensive to the funeral directors. It's cremated remains. Oh did they say that? Yeah, we said that because people wrote in and told us that. No. I think we found it in our research atually. Yeah, I think we talked about it on one of our many, many episodes where we've talked about human remains. All right, well, I apologize then to start off this short stuff. That's okay. It's really tough not to say. It's everywhere too. It's just so catchy. But apparently what the basis of it is that what you're talking about is needs more dignity than a jargony catchphrase like cremaine. I'm with you, it's not a it's not a McDonald's product. It's not me saying that. No, you're thinking of mc ashes. So what we're talking about is what people do with cremated remains. It's so hard not to say it now, and a lot of things. You know, sometimes people keep it in a vase in their home or in a box or something like that. But it seems like more and more the thing to do, and what I would like done as well, is is to scatter those cremated remains somewhere meaningful for for that person, whether it be a place they went camping or their favorite uh rooftop pool at a high end hotel or huh are you speaking about something specific or just pulling stuff out of your cuffs. Out of the cuffs? So okay, Wow, that was really nice and random. I love it. Um or you know someone's favorite restaurant you name it, like the man Chuck really love the steakhouse. So we're gonna sneak some cremated remains in here and put a couple of spoonfuls in the palm plant by the front door. Yeah, and maybe sprinkle a little bit in the bottle of tomorrow. Yeah why not? Yeah, That's what you just described is what's called wildcat scattering, where you know that there are rules in place, and there are plenty of rules in place about scattering cremated remains, but you're just flouting it. You say, I don't care. Chuck wouldn't care. Chuck would want me to spread them all over this steak joint, and that's what we're going to do. Yeah, so that's called wildcat scattering. What's interesting about the term wildcat scattering is I'm not sure if our friends at house stuff Works made that up or not. Yeah, this is from Nathan Chandler from houstuffworks dot com. Do you think they made that up? I don't know what it might be triggering a different memory. When I was learning to drive, the woman who taught me to drive, like the like I went to an actual driving school, she said, you know when you when you're in a snarl of people on the highway and you have to kind of wiggle your way out and speed up, call them wolf packs. Oh okay, And I thought that that's what they were called. And I remember saying that to a friend within the next year and they were like, that's not what that's called, and they said. It was such confidence that I realized that that woman had made it up and was basically trying to spread it around as if it were real, to make it real. So I saw wildcat maybe a triggered wolf pack who knows. You don't think it could have been a regionalism. I don't. I've never heard anybody else call it a wolf pack. Well we'll find out if someone writes in and they were like, oh yeah, and Treboygan we call them wolfpacks, right for somebody writing and be like that's so high O. Wolf pack is one place that if you if you're interested in scattering remains in a meaningful place, one place that you can do so in the wild, legal with permission is at a national park. Yeah, you got to have to get a special permit for those. You can also put them in bodies of water as well, public body of water, but again it's their regulations and a lot of times you need to get permission or a permit and then they say like, hey, listen, you can do that, but you can't do it, you know, fifteen feet from the shore because no one wants to swim up on that stuff. Like, get out there one hundred feet or whatever the rule is and notify us and then you're good to go. Well, from what I saw, you need to be out three nautical miles to scatter somebody's ashes legally. Is that's in an ocean clearly. Yeah, but what about in your favorite like municipal lake. I don't know, man, I do not know what the rule is on that because it probably depends on the place. The whole thing that they're trying to do is get around people getting open up against the cremated remains that are not floating in your lake. You know, um, no matter how you feel about it, you probably don't want to kayak through a like a puddle of or not a slick. A slick of cremated remains is kind of floating there. That wouldn't bother me. Okay, So I'm wondering about this because a lot of people might. But all over the internet there are some people who are like, oh, yeah, you don't want to do that, and other people are like, that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard. And it's like, you're not like throwing body parts into the lake. I mean, these are cremated remains. This is ashes, pulverized ash. And what's more, the temperatures that the corpse is exposed to are on the order of about fifteen hundred degrees f eight hundred and fifteen degrees celsis. There it's considered sterile ashes are sterile um, But I think it's just the association with the fact that it used to be a body that that's what really bothers people, right, I guess so, and everyone is different. I'm not yucking a yum or yemming a yuck, but I see it if I had done that, if I, like canoe through something that turned out to be remains, I would see that as like, Wow, that's kind of like an honor, almost like getting upgraded by a whale exactly. But the thing is okay, So yes, I understand that. But what if when you got out of the lake and you put your behind your trailer and it was just smeared on your canoe. Wouldn't you feel bad about toting the person's remains with you, you know, putting them in your garage, on your canoe, or even worse, hosing them off at home. Sure, that's I think one of the other problems. People who aren't grossed out by it don't want the responsibility of, yeah, somebody's cremated remains like on their shoe and not knowing what to do about that. Yeah, that's true. All right, I'm gonna think hard about this while we take our break and we'll be right back, okay, just like stars so much so we talked about places to do it legally in there. There are plenty of places. The key seems to be asking permission ahead of time, right. There are places where if you ask permission ahead of time, they'll say no, no, and don't you dare do it anyway. Right. One of those places, that's one of the most popular places to engage in wildcats scattering sometimes if you do it as a group, that's a wolfpack wildcat scattering is disney World in Disneyland. Yeah, theme parks, and of course Disney is going to be the big daddy. That place means a lot to a lot of people. And you know people that go there. We know people that go there many many times every year of their life and just it's a part of their fabric and they're like, I want to be dumped in the Pirates of the Caribbean. That's where I want to be. That's one of the big ones, as Pirates of the Caribbean. And it's a small world, I think. And then also the Haunted Mansion is another big one, and you can kind of understands. Yes, they're literally called dark rides, but the Pirates of the Caribbean one and It's a Small World makes sense because you're dumping the ashes into the water and it's really becoming part of that ride. The Haunted Mansion in particular, is a really bad choice because they're probably going to see you do it. They're probably going to stop the entire ride, evacuate everyone from the ride. Ye bring in a special custodial team and vacuum up the ashes and dump them in the trash. That's what's going to happen. That's where Grandpa will end up because there's, like he said, there's cameras everywhere, but people still take this risk. Although I mean, didn't something in this article say that Disney said that people don't do this. Yeah, so this article said that Disney's official stance is that it does not happen. I saw a twenty eighteen Wall Street Journal article. I should say I saw a lot of reference to it. I'm too cheap to spring for the subscription, but apparently in that article they interviewed people who were with Disney saying like, yes, this happens a lot, a lot, and here's what happens when they do that, and Ultimately, the bottom line is, even if you get away with it, even if you don't get caught and escorted out of the park and probably banned for life from any Disney attraction. Yeah, the cremated remains are going to be swept up one way or another and thrown in the trash. Your grandpa is not going to forever be part of the Haunted Mansion, right because they clean those rides thoroughly and frequently, and he's not going to there anymore. He's going to end up in the trash. And is that really where he wanted to be? Yeah? Yeah, meaning now right, that's what I saw is basically the bottom line to the whole thing. Yeah, And like you said, you you're probably gonna get kicked out. I don't even know if they have a public stance, like official stance on that, because their public stance is like, no one does that here, right, keep coming, keep coming the Disney world. You're not when you drag your hand in the water of the Pirate scribbean, And it's not just literally full of cremated remains. Maybe a tooth bobbing up and down here or there's now that would that would gross me out? Sure? That would be very disturbing. I still I do see the Pirates of the Caribbean Rye being the smart one. Though. If you're gonna do it anyway, if you're such a wildcat that you listen to this episode and still do it, we guess that's probably the best way to do it. I want to be scattered at my camp. Oh yeah, I'm sure of that. Unless something changes. That seems like a great, great place to spend eternity. Yeah, way to go, man, it's a great It's a great thing to settle on. You mean, I are still trying to figure that one out. Well, let me know. Maybe me doing it, Okay, I will if you go. If you guys go down in a hill of gunfire at a bank robbery or something, well, if it's gonna be you doing it, then definitely Pirates of the Caribbean. Right, want me banned from Disney World? You got anything else? I got nothing else me either. Wildcats scattering don't do it. Short. Stuff is out. Stuff you Should Know is a production of iHeartRadio.
