Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me. It's always Charles W. Chuck Bryant, hol A, Chuck Hola, Hola right back catching Um. How are you doing? I'm great? How are you? I'm doing pretty good? Yeah. Yeah, I've been learning a lot about bull foling lately. I don't know if you know. You mean bull killing. Bull fighting is what it's culture. It's not what I call it. Or you could also call it a cardido cordida. Boy, here we go corrida. Have you ever been to Spain? No? Have you? Yeah? Where I've been to? Uh? And then um Tosa de Mar which is little coastal town near Barcelona there on the coastal Brava, very nice. Have you been to Okay? Yeah? Very Have you seen a bullfight? No? I would not, I would not do that, sir, I have seen a bull fight. And um, to offend you even further, not only was it a bullfight, it started off with a cock fight. It was in Cancoon. I saw it with my sister and my dad, and UM, it was crazy because we were we were there and it was a bullfight like. It wasn't like you could have accidentally walked into this thing like it was a bullfight. Um. And I would say of the people there were um, white, probably American tourists, who booed and yelled and shouted things the whole time. And I remember thinking of that one Simpsons where um, Lisa was having a nightmare about being second chairs for sacks phone in the school band, and um, at the concert, everybody was booing and she wakes up and thinks, like, why would everybody come just to boo? It was exactly like that. People came just to boom to bullfight. Well, that is one people who who say bullfighting is not good, of which I'm one of them, say that that's one of the only reasons bull fights are still even going on is because of tourists. That they're the ones buying the tickets. And many times those tourists get there and they're horrified and they leave early and think, wow, no refunds making no exactly he just funded bullfighting. Yeah exactly, sucker. Um. A couple of quick stats roughly to between two hundred and two hundred and fifty thousand bulls are killed each year from bull fights, from bull fights, and um, I'm not sure if this is accurate, but the number I got was it fifty two matadors have been killed since. I'm surprised it's that few. Have you heard of Julio Aparichio? If you have a very strong constitution, Uncle Josh warns you against this one. Yeah, holy cow. It was almost like, how is that not photoshops? It was perfect? The horns so Julio Apariccio was he fell down and bull got the best of him, gored him with his with its horns, with his horns because bull um and what a boy? Huh, and gordon under his chin and it threw his through his neck and then the horn came out of his mouth perfectly. And m a guy from getting Images got a close up of it, like like fifty of them. It's it's amazing. I haven't seen the video. It's on the YouTube and it's one of those that's so awful that you have to like sign in and verify your age before you watch it. And I do not advise people to watch this. I don't even advise you to see the too. Look at the Daily Mail article that has it. But it's pretty crazy. But yes it happens. And I'm surprised that only how many fifties seven? The stat I got was fifty two in the last you know, three hundred plus years. Um, so there's not much of a fight going on. And matador is actually Spanish for killer, so is it really Um, yes, they're killer bulls for sure. It's the whole point, Like there's really no gray area here, like bull fighting is the the purpose of it is to kill the bull. Yeah, under certain conditions or um, within a certain framework. But that's the point of bullfighting. It's not anything but that. And if the matador fails to kill the bull, that's on him and it is a huge disgrace, like that's a that's a loss, and it's it's not very good right. Um, what I start, I'm starting to suspect that you are a post bull fighting Um. There are a lot of people and apparently Spain's um. I mean in Spain, it's like a natural cultural thing. It's been around for a while, and even people who feel the same way you do still say I still don't think it should be illegal. It's just too much a part of our tradition. Not everyone feels that way, though, No, definitely not. They did a gallop pole in two thousand ten and seventy of Spaniards said that they were ready to do away with it. Yeah, that's a lot of Spaniards. And that's up from like fifteen years earlier. So in this modern day, people are starting to think twice about it. Well, let's let's talk about this, Chuck, Let's talk about how how long people have been fighting bulls on the Iberian Peninsula. We don't know, Fox Show, but um, there is evidence of bull rituals dating back all the way to BC. Yeah. The Mycenaeans apparently used to leap over bulls that were charging. It was like a thing, and they were always revered, you know, as like these godlike creatures, which is why I guess they want to kill him. What. Yeah, what's the taurus? One? Taurus? Is that the Is that an astrological sign? Yeah? Okay, yeah, of course pretty ancient. Uh. The article points out that the Visigoth rule Um of the Iberian Peninsula from fourteen fifteen to seven eleven um No. Four fifteen four fifteen to seven eleven, UM had men on horseback fighting bulls um, which evolved into mounted bullfighting which uh rijneo, which still exists in Portugal horseback bullfighting where they kill the bull outside the ring. Later on, right, they weaken it to a certain point, which is the equivalent of killing the bull is far. I guess there's some point of no return that the Portuguese understand and they're like, okay, well we're done, come outside, and then that's that. But as anybody who's opposed bullfighting will tell you, that's not any more humane. Of course, it's just out of sight of the spectators. Um. So yeah, you've got what is it? Ray hoo rayjono joo um. And then uh. Bull fighting itself as we understand it today was firmly established in Spain by the eleventh century UM, and it came about during festivals, specifically one festival called the Fiesta descind Ferminton and anybody has been to Pampalonna will recognize that because that's where the running of the bulls takes place. And when in July now so I seven when it used to be September. And then in the sixteenth century they moved it to July, and ever since then the running of the bulls has been held. But it's been going on since long before that. And it actually started with a bunch of um ranchers their kids moving the bulls from like their pens to about a half a mile to the arena. Um. And then people started running alongside him and evolved into the running of the bulls. Now interesting els said the Spanish military leader uh midd eleventh century. He was one of the first to actually bring it into the arena and make it the sanctioned corrida, which was government sanctioned is today at least, but what's back then, I'm financially supported by governments to fifteenth century. It was a big part of the aristocracy until Queen Isabella came along and said this is not cool. I don't know why she was against it, probably because she was an animal lover. I would say that's probably a good idea, and Pope Pious UM five almost said the uh he banned it. But that didn't last very long, um only about eight years, because people were into it pretty pretty big time, right um. And then in about the I guess in the six d is when that that whole divergence between horseback and foot bull foot bull fighting took place, and it remained um the sport of the aristocracy until Philip the came along and he said, you know what, this is barbaric. You would have to be a low class barbarian to engage in bullfighting. So if you remember my court and you get caught doing this, I'll shoot you in the knee. And the aristocracy said, well, we want our knees in tack, so we're gonna stop doing this. And at this point bullfighting transferred from a kind of high flutant, snooty pastime to the them the pastime of the people, the national sport of the Spanish people, and from that point on it's it's stayed that way. Yeah, but they they The author does point there are arenas in Spain that still have the royal boxes for the royal family right to attend these things, so it hasn't gone away completely as far as that goes. So Spain is the heart and life center of um bullfighting, but there's other places that it's held. Obviously, I saw him in cancun Um. And if you're a bullfighter, you can follow the season pretty much year round and get work if you're good the heaven France. Did you know that? I didn't, but I saw that it's been It was banned in the UK. Had no idea anybody was fighting bulls and going on in Germany. It was going on all over the place. It's crazy. But that doesn't make sense that it would happen in Germany if the Visigoths are the ones who introduced it to the Iberian Peninsula because they were Germanic people from south of the south. Norway will call you south Way. I don't think the Goths. Uh. So we'll walk you through what happens in a in a corrida um in this whitewashed article version. But um, before this ever happens, we'll walk you through the couple of days before the bull even gets to the ring. Oh, this is a special treat for me. It is the bull. Um is not an aggressive animal at all. Bull likes to hang around in chew grass and uh smell flowers. That sounds like bullfighting propaganda to me. No, Ferdinand, the bull it's like a sweet creature. But they actually are not aggressive. They're only um gonna charge somebody if they're threatened and angry, which is what bullfighting is all about. Um. So in the two days prior to the bull showing up at the arena, they are abused. Um they are uh basically mentally destroyed versions of what a bull should be. You're fat bull. While they do fatten them up to make them slow. Well, that's a big problem, and you can call somebody out for that, Okay. Um. They have wet newspaper stuffed in their ears so they can't hear anything. They have vasoline rubbed on their eyes so their visions blurred. They have their eyes taped open so they can't sleep. Uh. They stuffed cotton up their nostrils so they can't breathe very well, and they stick and needle through their genitals. That'll that'll take anybody off. They rubbed this caustic solution on their legs, which makes the bull not be able to balance and uh keeps the bull from lying down. Ever. They strap their horns to the ceiling of their transport truck uh to take them on their long hot journey's wherever they're going. And for the two days before they keep them in a in a box. Oh wait, I'm sorry, that's not all they give them drugs to either pep them up or slow them down, just to keep them in whatever state they want them in, and give them laxatives uh, to just obviously make things even more uncomfortable. Um. Then they put the bull in the in this dark box for two days uh to disorient the bull. Finally, when they open the box, there's a light at the end of the tunnel that the bull thinks, my god, I'm finally getting out of here. Runs to the light and all of a sudden they're in a bull ring, right, And there's trumpets and fanfare and people cheering, um, and the bulls like, oh cool, how's how's that? Hey, how are y'all doing? I've been through some rough times lately. Um. Some of that stuff, I think if you were found out, you would be disqualified immediately, especially doing stuff that slowed the bull down or made it less dangerous. Yes, the bull ring is a ring for a reason. Um. Bulls would want to go try and hide in a corner, but the ring, the circular ring, will confuse in a bull to where it can't hide anywhere. Have you ever seen that footage of that bowl that like makes it up into the stands, Like jumps up and then is in the stands like on top of people. It was crazy. Was that bull run our test? No? Do you get that joke? Okay? So the different acts I believe are called ter CEOs. Yes, I believe so. And there's three of them, right, Yes, there's three of them. And the that's three acts in a fight in a cardido, yes, in a bull fight. Yeah, and um there's no suspense going on either by the way they all go down the same way. I bet it's suspenseful for the bull. Um. So the bull comes out the first act or what? Uh? Yeah? Act one? Okay. In act one there are um guys called peka doors and they're mounted on horseback and they are basically, um, I guess, low level torreros or bullfighters because both. A matador is not the only kind of bullfighter. He is the cream of the crop, pinnacle of bullfighters, the well paid rock star. Yes, um, but he works with the crew of pika doors who show up in the first act, and bandilli airos who show up in the second act. But the pika doors what they do is they lance the bowl between his shoulder blades, around his neck muscles and the whole point of this chuck. You'll love this one is to weaken the neck muscles so that the bull's head hangs so that the matador can get to its heart more easily. Yeah. It also hits a gland in the neck that releases adrenaline. Apparently. Um so they lanced the bull three times and twist the blade around to ensure maximum blood loss. Um. Three matadors will now come in. They will fight individually later on, but they all come in at first in the first act with their capes. And this is and for the for the bull fight, it's an afternoon of them. There's six bowls and three matadors, and each matador fights two bowls and each bull fight takes about fifty in twenty minutes. Yes. Um so they come in with their little capes and uh do their little maneuvers to draw attention away from the pika doors. And the Pika doors go and hide behind their little walls. They have these interior walls that they can hide behind. Whenever the bull starts to get too dangerous, they run and hide behind these walls. Yes, or if this America, the Pika doors would be dressed as clowns and would hide in barrels. Look at rodeo. Yeah, it will do a rodeo podcast at some point. Do we have to sure they don't. I don't think they kill the cals and rodeos. Okay, Um, So the pika doors leave the ring, the matadors leave the ring at two begins, and the vandel Garros, I know that's a tough one. They're they're basically bullfighters, assistant bullfighters. Put they're on foot, yes, and if you've ever seen a bullfighter a picture of bull fight, bulls seem to have some um crepe barbed sticking out of him. That's the bandelierros work. Yes, and that is called a bandias and it's a barbed dart. It's adorned colorfully. The bulls aren't the only things dying in this episode, and so was the Spanish language, because we are butchering it. I'm trying uh this of course, further weekends the bull um so the mighty Matador doesn't have much work to do, so the bull is still dangerous. Um are They run in circles at this point to to get it nice and dizzy and confused. The manador comes out for the final act and he has ten ten official minutes to kill the bull, well, to do a little showing off first and then kill the bull. Um after the ten minute warning. After the ten minutes he gets in a viso, which is a warning first warning. After three minutes he gets another one, and then he gets a third one, so he has a total of in actuality fifteen minutes to kill the bull or else the bull is let out alive and the matadors disgraced. But for the most part, the matador is going to dispatch the bull, and um, he does it. He first starts using the cape. And the cape is always held in the left hand. Is it? That's all right handed? Dudes? I did not. I was looking, and I could even tell that they were. Um there, the cape was kind of clumsy held in the left hand. They were still holding it in the left hand. Well, the guys I saw were practicing, So maybe I don't know, but I don't see why they would practice with their right hand. I don't either. Okay, but you have a cape in one hand, you have a sword in the other. Yes, and the point of the cape, by the way, we should probably get to this now. Um cape is always red because red Anger's bulls right not true. Balls are color blind, so they're not angered by red or any other color. What does get them going is the movement of the cape and sticking swords in their neck. That's another thing that gets them going. Um. And actually that's not necessarily true. By the time the manador comes out, sometimes the um the bowl is really tired from blood loss and being tortured for a couple of days apparently, um. And so the manador really kind of has to work to get it riled up again. And even though the bulls just like, just kill me, manador is like, not yet, we have a crowd to please first, So um the the manador. Eventually after the cape work is done. Um. Oh the cape is read by the way to high bloodstains. Um. Once the cape work is done, the manador will um as the bull runs past him, will plunge the sword in between his shoulder blades and what's called a estoccata, which is the death blow. And uh. It properly delivered estocata will sever the bulls a order and that will be that almost immediately for the bull. If it's not done correctly, then the bull can be in even more tremendous pain as it bleeds out. But to protecting into this, a bandeliero will come out and immediately deliver any any another thrust of a blade to make sure the bull is dead with a plantilla a smaller knife. Ideally they killed him with one blow. That rarely happens because apparently matadors aren't so great at doing that anymore. I don't know if they ever were. And uh, a lot of times the bull lives even through the smaller knife plunge and is still alive when the ears and tail or hoof or cut off and presented to the matador. We usually there's a there's another fail safe um where they just bring out a tractor and run the bull over a bunch of times to make sure that it's that's so nice. If that doesn't work, then the people come down from the stands and just start shooting it. That's not true, and it's not funny. It's not funny because it's not true, and they oftentimes do survive hanging on by read. Their lungs are punctured, so they're bleeding, like drowning in their own blood and like vomiting up blood through their nose and mouth like a whale. Dying and flurry. Uh. And sometimes they will take it outside and skin it while it's even still alive. Yeah, that's a kind of a tradition. Um. I saw the bull after the bullfight. It was pretty sad. Um. They take the bull right outside and um, they'll dress it and then sell the meat at the stadium. Um, which is customary and very strange, but that's one of the aspects of bullfighting. If you've ever wanted a bull burger and you wanted to eat it right after you saw it die, go to a bullfight in Spain. Uh. They will drag the bull out with some mules attached to chains. And UM, I don't know if the booing booing you heard, because apparently the people will boo and throw beer cans at the bull at the end. I don't know if that's what you were. It depends, so depends Um. No, no, no, no, that's this was. They were booing the matador, the bliros, the doors, everybody. They were booing a whole country of Mexico for this. Um. Yeah they're booing everybody. No. Um, it depends on the bull. If the bull was um a woss, then I could see the fans throwing beer cans at it. There's also um that an aspect of this that cannot be denied that a bull that shows great bravery, anger, um spirit, spunk, really tries to kill the matador or the bandili arrows will be very much revered by the people in the stands and gruesomely UM. They'll bring it out for a victory lap, being dragged by the mules in a circle around the arena. After it's dead, or apparently while it's still dying, people will cheer it through roses for it UM. And there's a there's a a UM. There's a rule where the crowd or the matador can ask for in uh indolito, which is a reprieve for a particularly courageous bull, and the president of the of the bullfight the referee can say, yes, I give this bullet reprieve because it's such an awesome bowl. We're gonna let it live. And the manador proceeds to um with an empty hand simulate the death blow, saying I could have killed the bull, but I like the bull so much I lobbied to get it released. That bull is taken away and UM put out the stud for the rest of its life. And there was one it's very rare to get an indulto. Um, And there was one one bull called Manzanito in he got an indulto because he gored all three manadors in the plaza that day. Wow. That that that will get you off right there. You get to go stud for the rest of your life. Mr. Bull. Horses are also abused. The ones that participate, their ears are stuffed with newspaper, wet newspaper, the blindfolded, and they sever their vocal cords so they can't scream out in pain because people don't want to hear that. Yeah, people don't like that, So they sever the vocal cords. So the horses that are, you know, trembling in fear inside this ring at this bowl, don't bark out and let people know that. And if the horses are hurt, they take them out of the ring and patch them up and send them right back in there. Where are you getting this activist info all over the place? Yeah, yeah, okay, I mean it's not activist info, it's how it goes down. No, it all just kind of has a certain ring to it. I'm not disputing it. I'm just saying like, yeah, well, I mean, coming out of my mouth, it probably sounds activist because I think it's an awful thing to do something like this. But this is the these is the facts. Okay, Well in check you will love the next part wherein we talk about famous matador. Yeah, I feel free. So uh, people have been doing this since well, we said like the eleventh century, right, El sid was supposedly the first guy to fight a bull in an arena. UM, and since then it's it's just become huge, big business. UM. But the first reel and probably only real golden age if you call it that, bullfighting happened UM from nineteen fourteen, and there were two matadors, Juan Belmonte Garcia and Jose Gomez, who fought bulls under the name joslit though um had a rivalry and um. Belmonte Garcia was actually the first guy apparently to stand still or stand his ground when he was doing cape work with a bull rather than try to run away from the bull. He's in fantasy footwork. Jsalito was his rival, and the rivalry was really going swimmingly, I guess for everybody but the bulls, until Hosalito was fatally gored UM at a match that both of them were at Garcia and Jsalito were fighting at um in N and that end of the Golden age of bullfighting. You'll be happy to hear. He must have been small Zalito. Yeah, his name is Jose, and I think if you're Jose and they call you hosalito, that means you're small, like add that eto to anything Alito or young because he started very young. Oh yeah, maybe that's true. He started at age thirteen, um and he was only I think twenty twenty five when he died. When he was gord so. Uh. Another guy who's gorge is named Manuel Rodriguez E Sanchez. Do you think that's like the mothers and the father's names when it's two last names and there's an e in and in the middle. I don't know. I would think so. And well, Rodriguez in Sanchez. You put the Rodriguez together and the Sanchez is together and you get Manuel also known as Menelette. Maybe so. And he was Gordon in He was the top matador from nineteen forty and nineteen forty seven, and I think is goring and the end of his being the top mattador was not coincidental. I think you're probably right. Uh, should we talk about the bulls because it's very specific what kind of bulls are fighting. They're all four years old, which I didn't know, I didn't, um, and they are specifically bred to bullfight. In the weigh about thirt hundred pounds. You want to translate that niquilas for our friends, it's that's right. And um, they are bread and ranches. And this article says that they're tested for bravery and ferocity and that if you pass that test, you would become a fighting bull. Um. And that may be true sometimes, but uh, matadors like to make their money and they don't want to be gored. So the high falutin mattadors will request very placid, docile bulls just to keep the show going. Is that true? That's what That's what I read. Okay, So have they just want to put on the show, you know, they don't want to die too? Well, I'm sure they don't want to want to make They want to make a few million bucks a year doing it easy too, because they get paid about a hundred grand a bullfight and they can do maybe thirty to forty or more. Yeah, I know the um Oh, the guy bel Monte. He had a record hundred and nine bullfights in It's like in Rocky three when he was fighting all the chumps just for a pay day. Oh yeah, he didn't want any real challenge. But ultimately he did want a real challenge because he fight. He fought Draco, well, he fought Clever Lang and three and three it was the Russian. Three was clever Lane. No, yeah, the first two were Apollo, the third was Clever Langing. The fourth was the Russian. I thought that he was, uh, Tommy Morrison. And then the six was when he came back as a trainer, huh. And the seventh was him enjoying a nice sandwich for two hours. No, Rocky three was definitely clever Line, because that was my favorite one until I got older and I realized that the person one was actually the better one. You know. I thought that I would think that too, and then I went back and watched it as an adult. I'm like, I mean, it's pretty good, but man, I loved it. There's just too much character development, and for a Rocky movie, well, it was a love story. It wasn't even a boxing movie. Wrong with you, I understand, but it was a love story starring and written and directed by Sylvester Stallone. That's right, all right, Back to the bulls. Bulls are never exposed to more than one fight. Yeah, so apparently they have very good memories, so they learned how to out due the uh, the matador in their in their cape. So that's why they don't fit them twice. And the guys who test their ferocity for I guess the ones that are tested, those are done on horseback, so that the bulls not like, oh I remember as capes, I'm gonna get you, I associate you with laxatives. Well, even this article says that they they alter bulls to make them easier to fight. But this is what I'm saying, so, um, it's a very participatory sport for the spectators. Um. So, like you can ask for an indolito, you can also challenge or charge uh somebody with fighting an altered bowl, one that's overfed and too fat and slow, one whose horns have been altered, because apparently the tips of the horns of a bull are very much like a cat's whiskers, and if you remove that, the bull is not going to have a very good sense of kinetics. And will never hit the matador. So if the crowd thinks that your career is like over pal, that's why I don't think it's quite as widespread either that or else. Um. Bullfighting crowds have become complacent. Well, I think that's definitely true. Yeah, Well, because it's tourists they don't know how to spot a fat bull, Well, then that very well may be the case. And they also apparently the way they stabbed them and where they stabbed them, they do so in order to make sure they charge straight instead of like I've got a bad left leg, all of a sudden, I'm gonna be going left all day or right all day. So, Chuck, we mentioned that you can make a pretty decent living doing bull fights, but you also mentioned, um that there's there may be the death of bull fighting as it were. Do you think that's really true. I mean, seriously, people have been doing this since the fourth century, and now, all of a sudden, just because of a bad economy and animal activism, bullfighting is going down. It's starting to well. The polls that the popular sentiment is changing in Spain over the past fifteen years is one um. Catalonia is the first region in mainland Spain to actually ban it in Barcelona's in Catalana. You, yeah, which is big because Barcelonlona had not one, not two, but three bullfighting arenas. That's right, and that took effect. That took effect actually just this year. On January one, they said, like, let's finish out the two thousand eleven season and then we'll ban it shouting from that point they had the last one at UH in September. I think September two thousand eleven was the last one ever. UM. That's a huge deal. But even in Spain they're kind of like this nooty Catalans like they don't they don't enjoy bullfighting. I think that's made some quarters of Spain even more fiercely proud of it. Yeah, probably like Madrid apparently is still very proud of their bullfighting UH. In two thousand and ten, one of the state television stations said, we are going to ban coverage live coverage of it because kids can watch this on TV. UM. They happen in the hours in the early afternoon hours, in early evening, so they won't broadcast until after ten pm. Now, right, Well, there's a there's a law that says you can't show animal cruelty on Spanish television until after ten pm because of children. And so that's effectively banned showing bullfighting in Spain. Um, which is a huge blow to it. Um, I guess economically or financially, because I mean think about how many how much money comes from television deals and sponsorships. If you can get rid of it on TV, like, that's that. And then there's also, Um, they've shown that there's evidence that government, that the federal government of Spain is pretty much what's propping up bull fighting these days, because um, there were what it went from a thousand bull fights in two thousand eight to eight hundred and two dozen ten in Spain, and um, that two hundred was almost exclusively, um, the result of cuts and government subsidies to small towns that can't afford to put on a bull fight. And so that means that, yeah, the government's holding the whole thing up. Yeah. I read a couple of interesting articles today. One of them was from a veterinarian. Uh, and they have vets at the bullfight um on staff, I guess ah. And this vet went on record as saying they did all this testing of like adrenaline and or adrenaline and all these different uh chemicals in the body on these bulls that had just survived, ones that were dead ones before they went in, and basically to prove that the bull suffers a great deal because there's this misguided notion that the bull doesn't suffer because they're this magical creature. I saw this one interview with a Bandaliro and he said that a veterinarian this is translated obviously, but he said, a veterinarian told me that the bulls have a special cell in their body that prevents it from suffering and feeling pain. That's not true. Oh are you sure. Yeah, there's no special cell that that keeps them from feeling pain. Well, that's a that's a larger debate too. I mean, like, I believe bulls can suffer. But you know, um, if you've read David Foster Wallace is considered the lobster. Can a lobster suffer? Is no susception is the perception the physical feeling of pain is that the same thing is suffering. Now we've shown it's not. Remembering our happiness audiobook, we talked about the difference between experiencing physical pain and experiencing suffering right now. They actually utilize different parts of the brain. So if there's no suffering, is inflicting pain on something e g. Cooking it? Um? Is that cruel? That's a good point, it is, But I think bulls experienced suffering. It's especially if they go through what you describe. Yeah, and if you're against bull fighting and you want to do something, you can email the or mail the embassies of these countries that still participate and tell them that, hey, I'm not going to visit your country. I'm not gonna spend my money there. If you're still gonna endorse this, it's a small thing you can do. Becaun, you mail me some wine because I can't make it over. There's some temperar neo. Uh. And I just I'm gonna go on record as saying this whole thing that it's a it's part of the culture is just crap. Well, the the Spanish federal government would disagree with you because in two dozen tend and what a lot of people see as a response to um the Catalonia band Um, the Spanish government transferred jurisdiction over bullfighting from the Interior Ministry to the cultural ministry, so as an attempt to keep it from being banned. It's gonna be uh, it'll be a tough fault one. But yeah, apparently even Mexico now is entertaining the idea of banning it. You know some other things that were defended as culture, genital mutilation on females, witch burning, bear baiting. Have you ever heard of that? Um? No. Bear baiting was popular in England up until the eighteenth century. That is, when you take a bear like a you know, grizzly bearer, brown bear, like a clown, well not far off, You put it in a pit and chain it to a mistake and release dogs on it, and the dogs kill the bear or the bear kill some of the dogs, so they release more dogs, and people sit around and gamble on is the bear gonna get eaten first or the dog's gonna get killed first? And uh, it's blood sport. And I think this is the same thing. You know. Um, that's where bulldogs came from, and that's where they got their name from. It's called bull baiting. And bulldogs used to not even come close to resembling what they do now. They were actually bred to be less vicious. Um. By making them slower and dumber and more cuddly, or not dumber, but more cuddly. Um. And that's how we have the modern bulldogs now. But they evolved from basically uh, in the nineteenth century bulldogs. Where we're where um pitple breed is now where there are a lot of people being like, we just need to wipe this breed off the face of the planet. It's gone out of control. They're crazy. Everybody scared them. They're killing people. Um. And then they managed to breathe the meanness out of them. But bull bull baiting to bull baiting bulls just have been taken it well. Embarbating actually still happens in Pakistan and it's uh, it's horrific. So two from me to you people of Spain, Mexico, France. Uh, ritualized killing of animals for people to pay for and watch is a little outdated and just silly and cruel, and I say, please stop from from chuck to you, from me to you. And one more thing. The whole notion of culture. Isn't that supposedly to advance your civilization? And isn't that supposed to mean like positive things like culture? I mean, what brings people together more than the ritual down here and wanting wanting bull fight. All right, I'm done. Um, So, how do you feel about bullfighting? Person? Which I think it's great. If you want to learn more about bull fighting UM or Chuck's views on it, you can type in Chuck or bull fighting in the search part how stuff works dot com. Uh, and I said search bar, which means it's time for listener mail. We're very riled up listener mail. That's right now. This is calm. I'm gonna call this. Uh. Illustrator wrote us about the comics episode. Guys, I'm in currently an illustrator. Uh. Does you not have much hope for his future in that field? No? I think he does. Um. I found because he does like Digital Illustration Team. I guess um. I found your podcast when I was hip deep in art school at the Art Institute of Boston. But there are only so many times I could listen to the same old Our Lady Peace songs on repeat from that group. No, he had like one song into the same song gets which song was? I can't remember. I dug it this song. Actually I got the CD because of that song. Man, I used to fall for out when I was fourteen and just be like, that's the only good song on the whole CD before the Kiss single. Yeah. Um, I'm now a professional illustrator, but I also teach art at a I B. And was able to live a many dream when my higher ups approached me about teaching a comic book class. So he was pretty stoked about this UM on the comics. And this is just some things he pointed out on the comics code of authority you guys talked about. World War Two was long over and the new round of superheroes Spider Man, Fantastic Four had yet to emerge from the minds of Lee Kirbean Ditko. As a result, comics were merely treading water and chasing from fad to fad, Westerns to romance to eventually horror. Horror comics are what really started to worry everyone, so they began to put pressure on companies like EC, who had made their names in Over the Top four. In turn, EC basically jettisoned at Steak in horror comics and latched onto a little humor comic, uh Mad, which we talked about. It was like UM stories guaranteed to drive you mad, exactly the original, but to this point Mad was published basically as a comic book. In essence, EC was looking to hedge its bets, so it relaunched Mad as a magazine UM, which is a very different distinction because all of a sudden wasn't under the code of authority. Uh. We were blessed with the very first Mad magazine, a very calculated move since they were not heavily scrutinized by comics and they didn't have to worry about the comics code. It is UM. I hope to make it big as a comics illustrator in children's book illustrator who says I can't do both. I also thought you might like to know that you're keeping me company during these long hours chasing the dream. And this dude's stuff is awesome and if you want to hire Greg Marathus, you can get in touch with him at the Greg Marathas Studio, which is g R E G M A R A T h A s dot com or Rida's blog Greg Maratha dot blog spot dot com. Nice and stuff is very cool. I told him I'd keep them in mind if we ever needed we could do some drawings. We need some Facebook timeline drawings. If he's holling to work for free, you get to it. Did we remember we um we got chastised biographic designer for holding that T shirt contest. Yeah, I emailed him back. Actually we did use to calm them down. Uh yeah, I was like, you know, most of these were amateur designers. There was some pros in there, but never mind. And it's not like we've forced anybody to do with But there's a whole there's a whole movement um from designers about design contests being awful, Like what other industry basically asked for free work as a contest quote unquote, there's like fiction contests. Yeah, there's all kinds of so box Derby's. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that people do for free as part of a contest, bake offs or bakes off. I'm sorry. And I saw some designers that say, I don't agree with that contests make me better and that's a ridiculous idea. Architecture as a field has been in contest mode for a century or more, and like, yeah, that's there's a lot of work put into it. There's a lot of work put into graphic design. Contests are everywhere I think that's a ridiculous stance. Well, his point was because he mailed me back and he was like, well, find the contest is fine, but you should give them a cut of the T shirt sales. I don't disagree with that. Well, I know that we had no choice. Well, no, we're in no position whatsoever to share that told him due if it was up to me, they would get of the T shirt sales. I don't know about that. Well, we don't get any well, I know, but still we could if we could negotiate on their behalf, we would work a little bit in for us to what a volatile episode right to the end. So I guess if you want to express your volatility UM toward us, that's cool. We can handle it. We've been taken up for years. You can tweet to us at s Y s K podcast.
