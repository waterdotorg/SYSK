Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and this is Stuff you Should Know good podcast. Right. How you doing man? I'm good? And well how are you the same? A little tired? Yeah, yeah, um, but other than that, I'm doing pretty good. Man. There's a lot of stuff going on to day with this topic. Yes, marriage, Chuck, you know, I am married, you're married. We're married, but not to one another. Uh, that's true. And in the state that we live, and we couldn't even if we wanted to. Yeah, and this this is probably gonna touch on same sex marriage, um, a decent amount because it's in the news, and hey, it's marriage too, right, so we're not going to ignore it. But it's not necessarily just about that. It's about just marriage as a whole. Right. Everybody call this one how same sex marriage works? Yeah, exactly, But now maybe we cannot do that one if we cover it in this one. You know what I'm saying, how same sex marriage works. Yeah. I feel like we're going to cover it enough in this it's pretty straightforward stuff. Um. Well, let's talk about marriage, all right, Okay, Um, Really, if you boil the whole thing down, it is, as far as the government views it, very very very very very unromantically. It's basically a legal contract between two people, and therefore there are legalities that you have to go through, and as a result of going through this this legal process, you are endowed with certain legal rights. That's marriage. That really is though, And it's like, I draw a distinction. I don't think it's like, oh, it's unromantic to call it that, because that's what it is. It's a difference between a marriage in a lifelong relationship with somebody that now that's romantic chuck, Yeah, I mean that's where the romance is. The marriage is just some official way of recognizing that, right Okay. So um, and I would imagine it's not just it's not just the um desire to be, you know, to have your relationship recognized in that same way that it's a lifelong commitment legally, but also to get the benefits as well as one of the those are two probably very big reasons that same sex couples want to be legally married or allowed to legally married. Um. So, since it's a legal process, chuckers. Um, all things start with an application. All legals processes start by filling out an application. And marriage is no different. Yep, you gotta get that license. You got to apply to get that license. And uh here and uh, Emily and I went to Decatur. It was the sign on the wall was marriage and gun licenses. We thought was kind of funny. Yeah, get both in the same one stop shopping. Uh Uh. But each state has its own uh laws regarding everything concerning marriage, especially the world not especially, but the first of which is the license and application process. How old you got to be? All that stuff varies from state to state, it does. And um, until very recently, Uh, Alabama allowed kids as young as fourteen. I believe they were the youngest state. It says in this article that there was kids as young as age twelve. I think, is that right? I think so. But that I think that was like only with like a court order or a court permission, like like a pregnancy or something. I don't know, well that that's that's one of the surprising things is in Georgia, UM, if you're under eighteen, uh, you have to present a birth certificate. And I think your parents have to be present, both of them unless the unless the bride to be is pregnant, and then all rules go out the window. Yeah, most states that allow it under eighteen. The parents have to sign off, right, and there has to be like some reason. But like we said, it varies from state to state and it would take two hours to go over all that. So if you're interested in getting hitched in your seventeen, look it up on your state's website. You don't want to go over to state by state. Do you remember the the dude from UM Lost and then he was in one episode of X Files. I can't remember his name. Which guy from Lost? I don't remember. I didn't watch Lost. I just know he was on Lost and he married. He's like pushing fifty forty something and he married a sixteen year old girl. Uh yeah, and they were gonna they were sending themselves up. I believe to have UM a reality show or whatever. But her parents signed off on it. I remember like that. There was a big it was a big news story. Remember that too. They moved to Nevada, or they went to Nevada to get married, which is not um uncommon. I understand to move to a different state. No, to go to to go to Las Vegas to get married. Sure, yeah, people do that. So no matter where you are, you fill out this application, you pay a nominal fee. Uh, and then after your ceremony, you get a certificate that says you're married. Here's proof, show it to whoever you like. Yeah. Sometimes you need a blood test. We did not need one here in Georgia. But that's what you always kind of hear, the old fashioned thing, like go down and get your blood test and get married. Yes, but make sure you are disease free and not cousins. That's right. Is that what it's for to to check DNA? No, okay, I don't think they have the equipment to do that. I didn't think so either. Uh. And you can get married by a varying like a bunch of different ways. Um, you can get married by your best friend if you want to, as long as they get certified online as able to do that, which is what we did with our father in law, just to make him part of the experience. That's stepfather and my stepfather, the one in Ohio. Yeah, yeah, they're all in Ohio. But yeah, so chuckers, now that now that you're married. Um, according to federal law, you are eligible and open for I think thirty eight federal benefits. Is that still correct? Yes? Is that part of doma? Um, I'm not sure if that's a specific part of doma, but it's it's probably a part of many different laws, you know, if there's a plus, but it's it's all. This is all specifically federal level. Yeah. Yeah. So for example, and we'll talk about DOMA in a minute. Yeah, I believe we should so. Um. For example, if if Emily is in the hospital, you have a legal right to go visit her. That's right. I can even make medical decisions on her behalf, that's right, unless she has a living well right, which we would do together anyway. Um. You can get benefits if you're a federal employee. Um. You can get inheritance rights, property rights sometimes even if there's no will. Yes, you me can take out a life and ensures policy on me and it's legal. Yeah. Tax benefits of course of being married, you can file that way. Um. You can receive Medicare, Social Security, Disability, veterans benefits if you're a spouse, legal spouse. Yes, you can immigrate your spouse to the United States, Yeah, more easily at least. Yeah, if I killed somebody, Emily could visit me in jail, that's right, and then prison right as my spouse, and I would imagine depending on the state, there would be conjugal rights as well. Yeah, definitely. So those are just a handful of the eleven hundred entitlements that you gain. You don't want to go over all of them. If they have a list, I'll do it. So yeah, there there are a lot of good reasons to be married. You can also file jointly, so you get a tax break there. Um. And in addition to like the legal benefits, there's been tons and tons and tons of studies um on marriage that show that, like, there's actually psychological physiological benefits to marriage. People people happily married, I should say, um, not just married, Like there's a key to it. You have to be happily married. They tend to live longer live um, they two parents, a married parent household, um tends to produce more stable, well adjusted kids that do better in school. Yeah. True. Yeah, well, I mean there's tons and tons of studies, but it doesn't necessarily relate to same sex or opposite sex it's just married parents. Um happened to do that statistically, that's right. So what else? Uh, Well, people are getting married later and later. I think everyone recognizes that. But um to the tune of people born from n to ninety nine of men and women were married by and compared that to last year, where the average age of marriage was twenty eight point six for men and twenty six point six for women. And basically there hasn't been a year since the nineteen fifties where the median age has not gone up. She's going up and up and up and up. Yeah, And you would assume that it would have continued to go up and up and up prior to the nineteen fifties. But what's really interesting is in eighteen ninety the average age that a man got married was twenty six, and it declined um down to the nineteen fifties and sixties when it reached its lowest level, lowest age, which is like, um, like twenty two or something like that, and and then it started to go back up, which is very odd, and it did it for men and women because you would think in you know, olden times, you get married at age twelve, you know, so people were getting married at maybe sixteen for a median age, but it was more than it was older than than people were in the fifties when they were getting married. So the fifty might might have just signified some marital boom. Maybe. I guess people decided that, Um, they were not interested in pre marital sex. They just decided that. Um have we covered polygy? We did a full podcast on podcast even need to mention that. That's what I thought when I was reading this, I was like, wait a minute, this this reeks of something familiar. Um, but that is a type of marriage. Um, And I guess go listen to that podcast on Did we call it plural marriage or polygamy? I'm sure we talked about it as plural marriage, but we called it how polygamy works, right, And I guess the very condensed form of this is that it is officially condemned by the Mormon Church these days, although an estimated thirty to sixty thousand polygamus still uh well, I guess still practice polygamy. Uh. So there are other types of unions these days. Um. There are are civil unions, domestic partnerships in regular old fashioned marriage, and a civil union entitles same sex couples the same legal rights as marriage and benefits. So that's you know, like you said, after two things, the benefits and just the common recognition among their peers, like I'm just like you and I'm married just like you. Or in this case of civil union, UM would only give you the rights and not the badge of marriage. Right. And there's nine states where you were civil unions are permitted for same sex couples. That's right, UM, California, New York City, Maine, and the District of Columbia, I believe allowed domestic partnerships for same sex couples. That's right. And actually, UM, one of the one of the big um same sex marriage cases that's before the Supreme Court right now is a little old lady who UM lived with her partner for decades and because she has a domestic partnership under New York lause, she didn't not to pay any tax, she didn't have to pay any inheritance tax. But she got slapped with like a three hundred and nine dollar federal inheritance tax because the Feds don't recognize their domestic partnership. And that was that's one of the cases of Supreme courts hearing right now, Well, you can get full on same sex married as of December of two thousand twelve in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, Maine, Maryland, Washington State, and the District of Columbia, and that is full same sex marriage like outright. And at the same time, thirty eight states have laws banning outright same sex marriage. So people are really drawing the line on this issue in this country. Yeah, well it's pretty polarizing issue to say the least. Like I have one stat things are changing of people in a same sex marriage and then last year, so that drop in fourteen years. You know. In researching this article, I've really um, I really it's yeah, I've really found out that we were a radically different country than we are today. Like socially speaking, we are really really different. There was a lot of stuff, a lot of laws that passed and a lot of mentalities that were like supported legislatively that just don't make any sense today to a lot more people, you know, like doma sure the idea that that passed, and like this kind of the meanness behind it is is it's just well, I guess it's being picked apart right now, right, Yeah, The Defensive Marriage Act um define marriage as only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife. And uh. Bill Clinton famously signed that and has been sort of changing his story like every four or five years since then on why he signed it, because people kind of pick home and out, like Billy Dude of all presidents, why did you sign it? Um? In ninety six he said a quote, I have a long I have long opposed governmental recognition of same gender marriages, and this legislation is consistent consistent with that position. And then in two thousand eight he said, all it said was that Idaho did not have to recognize a marriage sanctified in Massachusetts. That's pretty good, Quinton. So he basically was like, hey, listen, man, all I'm saying was it was left up to the states, which was a bit of a reversal. And then in two thousand nine he said, well, you know the reason I signed it was I thought the question of whether gay should mary should be left up to states and too religious organizations, and that if any church or other religious body wanted to recognize gay marriage, they ought to. So this is a bit of a he's saying it's being spun as him coming out as like anti gay uncertain levels, and he's saying, no, no, no, you're rewriting history in a different way. What it really meant was let's just federally say this and let the states decide. But that's a pretty glim interpretation of DOMA. From what I understand, it basically removes states rights. And that's one of the things that the Supreme courts looking at now too, is DOMA. Is DOMA unconstitutional? And one of the ways that the the pro same sex marriage lobby could actually harm itself is if the Supreme Court decides to look at DOMA as the state's rights issues and kicks it back to the states, then all of these bands will be upheld rather than just saying no, it's it's unconstitutional because it bans marriage effectively between same sex people. So that's I mean, it's not as it is the state's rights issue in a way, but not in the way that Clinton is saying it. It doesn't allow states to kind of make up their own mind. Uh. I think Clinton is trying to. I don't think he's super proud of it now, and I think he's sort of been backtracking ever since and on reasons why he supported it at the time. And you know a lot of Congress people have come out since then and reverse their their statements on it, saying, you know, I've evolved in my thinking to this point, and I now think we should look into it more at least and not necessarily like fully in support of it. Um. But there are eleven countries if you're wondering what's like around the world, like all across the country you can get married if you're same sex, like Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, and Spain. It is a federal Uh, it's legally allowed federally. So let's you know, say what you will about that. We want to get married, go to Spain. Um, moved to Spain. You don't have to like go live there because if the United States whouldn't recognized or Netherlands, that's an explice. South Africa, we've talked about that. Um. Yeah, But I mean I think most people who want to get married who are of the same sex want to stay at home. She just want to get married at home, you know. Um, this is uh, and you're talking about a UM, I guess, being allowed to be married in an entire country. There's been a couple of attempts to ban UM same sex marriage as an entire country in the US, but have been unsuccessful, like make it a constitutional amendment. Yeah, and that has not happened now. So in addition to domestic partnerships and civil unions, that's when I find interesting the reciprocal beneficiary relationship UM, which was Hawaiian state law and I guess it was kind of done away with in favor of civil unions in two thousand eleven or twelve. But basically it's it's it grants you the right of a married couple, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're a couple in the eyes of the law, unless you say we're a couple it UM. It so like brother and sister can can be a reciprocal beneficiaries UM and aunt and her nephew or whatever. It doesn't mean you're a couple. It means that like you can make legal decisions for one another, and it's for people who are like dependent on on one another living situations, that kind of thing. So don't be super creeped out by that when you and sister and stuff like that. Uh, do you got anything else on same sex marriage? Oh? Um, no, I guess that's it. I'm very interested to see what happens. It's the civil rights issue of our age, and that's what a lot of people are arguing, Like, dude, let's just learn from history. Do we have to go through the same steps every time we do this? Um with allowing people rights, finally giving them the rights that you know everyone will in the future eventually agree they should have and should have had all along. Um. But apparently we have to go through at the same struggle every time for each group before they get their rights, their civil rights that are afforded everybody, whether it's the African Americans sitting where they want on a bus or women voting. Um. Yeah, it seems like this pops up every now and then in this country, where people say, hey, wait a minute, I don't have the same rights as that dude over there, right, and why not? It's very interesting, it is, and I'm sure like we're going to get a lot of listener mail about this. Yeah. Well, you know, we're just putting it out there. This is what certain people think and that's what other people think. Yeah, I guess, And luckily we live in a country where you can voice those opinions. So before we move on to other parts of marriage, let's take a quick little message break. Let's do it, and now we're back with more marriage. Yeah wow. Um So Chuck one of the ones that I've always heard of his common law marriage, and I was doing a little research on it, and it doesn't make much sense to me. I don't understand, like, apparently its origins where that's what marriage was like two people just kind of shacked up and they were viewed by society and the law as married. And then the the church insinuated itself by saying, no, there's no more clan to stying marriages anymore. You have to do this publicly and declare, you know that you want to be married, and there's got to be a priest and let's you know, maybe maybe you know, somebody's gotta be there, so let's have a witness or whatever. And that that's kind of like the rival of common law marriage. And and as it's become more and more um prevalent, common law marriage is kind of fallen into the waistide. Well don't you just have to shack up for seven years? No, that is a myth, yea, everyone always says, I always heard that, Yeah, and I think that's just a common misconception. Um. If you want to be uh common law married, you actually have to present as a married couple. You have to change your last name, file joint tax returns, basically kind of really live as if you're married, not just live together and fight over where to go to dinner. Right, you know, it probably wouldn't hurt to contact your local probate court and file something like saying, hey, we're married. Okay, as far as you're concerned, we're married. We're common law marriage. Now, this only works if your state recognizes common law marriages, and again, fewer and fewer states do these days. Um. In some states, if your common law marriage was around before the nineties, certain dates in the nineties, it would be grandfather then Georgia being one of them. Right, Yeah, if you were common law married in Georgia before January one, you're still common law married if you still are nice and the states also don't. Um. We we joked about the seven year thing, but there is no set time in any state that you have to live together to present yourself as common law man and wife, although I don't you know, I don't know that you would do that after you just moved in together. But hey you can if you want. Well, you know, um talking about moving in together, there was a study that recently found that more and more people are living together before marriage um or instead of marriage. And also apparently one of the reasons we were talking about the marriage age increasing, one of the reasons they think that people are putting it off more and more lately, especially millennials, is due to college debt. How sad is that? Okay, So I'm broke, so I'm not gonna get married, like I can't afford to get married right now. That's that's terrible. I don't say what does it cost you though, I don't get that. Well, I mean, you've got to get a ring, and there's got a I mean, there's just certain things to it. I guess that certain costs. Yeah, I guess it depends on what you're looking for out of your wedding, in your rings and things like. It doesn't have to be expensive, you know than half to just these college kids these days, I don't know, have no money to get married. Give them some advice to just get married, don't get a cheap ring and get hitched at the courthouse. So okay, so um. As far as shacking up goes, more and more people are doing it. Apparently, between two thousand and six and two thousand and ten, almost half of UM, straight women ages fifteen forty four said that they have lived together with somebody who they weren't married to. And of gay women, Yeah, I have another stat here that said from nineteen eighty two, Uh, it is quadriple the number of people, and this is people. Percentage of women choosing to not get married and just cohabitate has gone from three to eleven percent. And um, what does this all mean to staying married? We're staying together not a lot. The divorce rate has hovered pretty close to for quite a while. He goes up a little, goes down a little, but um hasn't gone down some. It's gone down a little bit, but it's never like some enough of a stat to like, you know, rewrite the record books. You know, it's always close to fifty. It seems like. Um, And then they found all sorts of interesting things. Um, among women, there was a fifty two percent chance that a first marriage would survive for twenty years, and fifty percent of men their first marriage would survive for twenty years. Oh and another interesting thing. They found that, um, your marriage is more likely last if you went and graduated college. Huh So seventy eight percent of women with at least a bachelor's degree made it to their twentieth anniversary as opposed to what was that? So that's a pretty big yeah. I wonder what the the explanation is for that. Uh, I don't know. Maybe it takes a certain amount of tenacity to through college, and maybe it takes a certain amount of tenacity to stay married. If you have kids going into the marriage with someone else, Um, you have less of a chance to stay married. Thirty um of women marrying a man who already had kids made it twenty years. So, but if you have kids after you get married, you have a higher likelihood of staying together. Yeah. So having your own kids good, marrying in two kids bad. Yeah, but then's having your own kids is one of the um, one of the leading reasons that people stay together. Um. Apparently there's also couples who drink together um tend to stay together more especially um if they drink about the same amount. Make sense. UM. Couples who have I ran across this two thousand eight study UM from the University of Denver. Couples who have fun, which fun is defined is basically spending time together UM free of financial, family or other stresses. Okay, UM, they tend to stay together longer, which makes a lot of sense. Basically, if you go on dates with your spouse, you will stay together longer. And religion also plays a part. Percentage of married women you say religion is important six and a percentage of married women who say religion is not importants And interestingly, it's about ten percent less for men on both uh saying religions important religions not. Women just care more than the number. One UM. I guess indicator that people will stay together, not necessarily in marriage, but that like as a couple UM is shared curiosity. Remember we did how curiosity works years back. One of the one of the indicators that our predictors sorry that a couple would stay together was that if both of them were curious people about the same things or this period just in general. UM. And and it's like beat out religion, UM. All these other shared things that you would think that would you know, keep two people together, you know, make them attracted to one another. But it was shared curiosity, a love of just being curious, as long as it's not curious about like I wonder what it be like to have sex with that woman? Precisely, it's bad curiosity, right, Yeah. So since you brought that up, Um, you sent another article on how stuff works. That was pretty interesting that Molly Edmonds wrote about the seven year itch. Did you check that out? So basically the seven year which is this idea that after seven years people get bored with their marriage and they divorced or the stray or whatever, um. And there have been studies that have found that seven years is actually like a a significant moment in the average marriage, and that a lot of them do end up dissolving at this point. Right. Yeah. I think the median age in the US is seven just over seven years, so that would suggest that this old yarn is correct. But it's actually possible that it's even less than seven years. That it's that there's an indicator that um, at four years, uh, marriages start to go I guess south. Um. And there's an anthropologist an evolutionary anthropologist named Helen Fisher who had a pretty good idea of a pretty cool explanation or yeah I thought it made sense, go ahead, level it. Okay, Well, she said that basically, back in our earlier evolutionary age, took took took took um took took's era. Uh, four years was about the time that a couple would spend together conceiving and raising a child, and then it was time to do it again, and they typically did it with other people right spread the seed. So that so Fisher's basically pressing the point that we are evolutionarily hardwired to um to not last in a monogamous relationship owner in four years, which is a pretty depressing idea, especially if it makes sense um. But she also points out that there that being aware of this or understanding this possibility can let you guard against it. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Like keep your marriage exciting, have fun with your spouse, go on dates with your spouse, you know, and you can you know, beat that for year, seven year itch or whatever. Just don't like research that stuff. Come up with your own stuff, is what I say. What research like? There's gazillions of articles like how to keep your marriage spicy. And it's just I encourage you not to read those If you want to spice super marriage, just try some things on your own. Don't read Red Book. I I don't know. Man. If Red Book helps and read Book helps, it's our mata, al right, So you know, go ahead read those articles and they'll tell you to You know what did they say. Oh they all say things like it's all like sex based usually Uh, actually that's not true. They're talking about Cosmopolitan, not Red Bus. Be more active with your husband and get him out hiking and then dress up as a French maid every once in a while. It's just like, I don't know. I mean, if those articles help you, then it's all well and good. I take it back. Um, well, you were saying like that what to do, like go out on a hike or something like that. This This study from two thousand and eight from the University of Denver pointed out that, um, when you go out on a date, you should be aware that your spouse may not have the same idea of what a date is that you do depending on your sex. Like for women, haven't going on a date is like a chance to have an intimate conversation just basically friend time, close time, whereas like the dude is more prone to think a date is like going to a movie or going to a baseball game or something like that that you do together and you're on a date and you're sitting next to another and like you lean over and kiss and everything, but you're both watching the game. You just watch the game, right, you know, so you you I guess again, an awareness of that will probably get around any weird situations where you're just like, we went on a date, how are you not happy? Yeah? This good point. I found that sporting events I get kind of chatty though, Well, you would be a perfect date, you know, Yeah, Emily, you'll go to baseball games. But like literally the only time it took her to a Falcons game, she brought magazines. That's funny. People around me were like, so pissed. That's a waste a ticket. You means like a perfect woman in that, Like we'll go into shows or something like that. She doesn't like, she's not chatty during shows, especially like a concert. Yeah, like you know when you're at a concert and it's like they're playing the music and just see him, then somebody just wants to talk to you the whole time. Yeah, maybe it's not like that. It's pretty awesome. Yeah, I'm always right next to that person. Whoever, the most obnoxious person in any crowd is. I will be no more than five ft away from there. I feel like I am. But I've tried to installed the new policy in my life. I used to just get upset, and because I'm non confrontational with strangers, I would just sit there in my blood would boil. Whereas there's three ways you can go about it. You can do that. You can confront the person, say hey, would you mind keeping it down? I would never do that. But the third option I've discovered here in my forties just move. Yeah, unless you're like in a reserve seat, I just go stand somewhere else. It's just not worth it for me. Yeah, that's a good chuck. Yeah, And I found that that I'm all of a sudden not obsessing over this loud person next to me while Steve Mountainous is telling a nice story on stage. Uh. And I just avoid the drunkest people in the room. That's good. It's always a good motto. Yeah, Uh, what else you got? I got nothing else? Cool? We did. We did how marriage works? Marriage good? Agreed? Yeah. Uh. If you want to learn more about marriage, there's like a whole channel on most there a sub channel or something on the site. I believe if you want to learn more about marriage, get married, because if you're gonna learn everything you need. Yeah, it's like immersion learning through immersion. Um. You can also type the word marriage into the search bar at how stuff works dot com if you and your partner are curious types um, and that would be probably a predictor of your long term success. Um. And I think I said predictor in there. So it's time for listener mail. Not quite, it's time for a message break, okay, okay, And now it's time for listener mail. Huh No, no, Josh, not listen to mail. Oh we're going to continue, I believe part two of what will be three of Okay, Well, I'm going to kick it off. Are you ready please? I want to give a big shout out to our buddy Ryan Flanders over at Mad Magazine for sending us a ton of great stuff magazines, hats, pins, pins, masks, buttons, masks and beyond. Like the coolness of that.
