Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short Stuff. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Dave's here in spirit, so it's short stuff. Let's get it started. I know we've talked about whether or not you have skied, divn doved, dived, Yes, all of them, and I think that you have right. Didn't you do a tandem? John? I did one time, and uh, it was I think I said before, and I'll say it again, I blacked out at first, like second or two out of just yes, I've never blacked out from terror before, but I did that time. Uh. And overall, you did it and you were okay with it? Or were you When you got to the bottom you were like that was actually all oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yes absolutely, But I wouldn't do it again. There was a period where I would have and then you was like, no, I've done it too. We've both done it. Let's just leave it at that and not breasts our luck. Yeah. I still have not, and I was thinking about it today and I'm not scared too or anything. I don't have a problem with heights. I think it could be fun. But I'm also just kind of like, now if I bother there's a lot at stake. Now, well, yeah, that's yeah, that's one of those like early twentysomething thing that's when it's best to do. But then there's plenty of people who are like, I'm a middle aged guy, I'd ever been doing it forever. The key is to never jump one thousand times. You just need to jump nine times and just stop right there. Apparently, yeah, because if you ask Ron Bell, who is a certified usp A United States Parachute Association member, I guess I don't know what they're called. Dude, Uh, do your jumper. He's made thirteen thousand jumps and had fourteen mouth functions, and he said that's about on target, about one in a thousand jumps. Something could go wrong. But part of the reason for this episode is that doesn't mean certain death just because there is a malfunction. No, there's a lot of ways that your parent shoot malfunction um, and it basically has everything to do with your shoot not deploying correctly, which the appropriate, appropriate thing to say when your shoot doesn't come out is shoot, oh shoot, you know, terrible, thanks. But the problem, so you're going about a hundred and twenty miles an hour just to put this into perspective. By the way, it's terminal velocity after falling for twelve seconds. A human being won't travel faster than that, no matter how far they're falling. Charlie Cheen taught us all that totally did back in the nineties. So you imagine how much cocaine he was on when he was filming that movie. It must have been like literally mind boggling. So you're traveling a hundred twenty miles an hour straight towards the Earth and your shoot doesn't go out as it should, and there's a lot of different things that can happen with a what's called a partial mauthfunction, and a partial malfunction means the shoot tries to deploy, but something happens to keep it from deploying correctly. Absolutely so, Um, there's typically like something like your line getting messed up, where the shoot comes out okay, but the two sets of lines on either side of the shoot, UM might get kind of wound up. Kind of like how when you were a kid and you spun around on a swing set that chained would would twist up ahead of you above you. That same thing frequently can happen when you're parachuting. Um. Fortunately, it's kind of easy to do. You just kind of twist the other way and it'll untwist, just like with the the swing set. The key though, is to not go out of your mind with fear and forget how to turn one way or the other. Yeah, I think don't panic is the number one role of all of the stuff. Was that a hitchhiker's guide reference, I mean, yeah, plus general life. As long as it was in there somewhere, it's good. Yes, that's called the line twist. The other partial malfunction is known as a line over, which means that your shoot tries to deploy, it maybe does deploy, but one of the lines has crossed over where the shoot is, and so the shoot is sort of you know, if you can imagine a parachute with one of the lines kind of running through it instead of where it should be, which is dangling down from it, then you've got a parachute that's sort of working but not like it should now. And that can be a real problem when your main shoot doesn't open. But luckily people who jumped out of planes plenty of times have figured out that it might help if you have a second shoot and we're gonna talk all about that second shoot and how it probably will save your life after this message. Wit you think it sounds great, Well, now we're on the road, driving in your truck. Want to learn a thing or two from Josh can Chuck. It's stuff you should know, all right, Okay, Charles? So, Um, your main shoot is deployed and not functioning. Either you've got a line cross that won't undo, you've got a line over, or in some cases, your shoot just hasn't deployed at all. What do you do, big shot? What do you do? Well, that's called a total malfunction. If your shoot just doesn't come out or doesn't open at all, it's a complete failure. Uh, you have a reserve shoot. You've always got another one in there. And the good news is that any old well I don't know any old because I'm sure they make sure the most experienced parachuters pack that main shoot wherever you're going. But you do not have to be a certified f a A operator to pack that main shoot. You do have to be that to pack that reserve shoot though, right, which is like an extra level of protection because those people are very sober, they know what they're doing no nonsense. Crew cuts, every last one of them, and they they will pack your reserve shoot very very well. The thing is, if your reserve shoot doesn't open, this article points it out pretty plainly. God wanted you dead. Your number was Yeah, I mean, reserves are not supposed to fail because they are the redundancy. But um, it can be a manufacturing mistake. Um. Whereas the chances of the reality is when your other, your main shoot fails, it could just be that it was packed wrong, or that you came out of the plane funny in your body is at a weird angle, and it sounds kind of funny to say, but if you are going to have a parachute malfunction rather than a line over a lying cross, you are actually better off if your main shoot doesn't deploy at all, because that cuts down on the chance of your reserve shoot getting tangled with your main and shoot. So if you're gonna have to use your reserve shoot, it's better if the main shoot isn't deployed. But if you're worried or whatever and your main shoot is not working, don't hesitate to deploy that reserve shoot. Just go ahead and use it. That's what it's there for. That's right. In this house stuff Works article, Bell is quoted as saying, when in doubt, whip it out. That is so Bell. That is so Bell, So ted nugent too. We Um. We had a guy put in floors at our house once and he was a naked skuy diver. And he said, and he said one time he got blown off course. And this guy was not There was nothing that about him that made you say, like, yeah, you know, I bet you were a pretty handsome naked guy diver like he was. Whatever. The point is. The point is, um, he was blown off course once and he had to hitch a ride back naked except for his parachute. What's the point. I don't I don't get the naked sky up. He said, it was very Um, it was a very freeing sensation. You can imagine. I mean, that's what they say about being naked doing anything right. This is like wind whipping past your gentalia. Your gentalia. Yeah, it's like s'mores. It's a contraction. Uh So. The other good thing about um the fail safe these days is that if you, let's say, you go out of like you blacked out Let's say you didn't regain consciousness and you weren't doing a tandem jump, and all of a sudden, Josh Clark is just hurtling to the ground passed out. UM, you will probably still be okay because these days they have UM these modern devices called automatic activation devices a A d S, and they use computerized sensors that basically say, hey, if you're falling below one thousand feet and you're going at least seventy eight miles per hour, then something's wrong and we're gonna we're gonna automatically deploy the backup parachute, this little computerized thing. So it's like you said, there, there's like, it's not a death sentence. If your shoot doesn't open. There's a lot of ways that you can resolve this. But there are some instances where your shoot just doesn't open. UM. What's crazy is is that people die from those very infrequently, UM or I should say, taking into account all jumps, there are very few people who die parachuting. UM. I think in two thousand, UM thirty two people died out of two point seven million skydive jumps, and then in just eleven out of two point eight million died, and that's not taking into account people who actually have survived these things where the their parachutes just didn't deploy and they hit the ground and they actually live, which does happen from time to time. Yeah, And I guess just some back of the envelope math which I'll probably get wrong if Bell is correct, and that about one in a thousand have some sort of partial malfunction at least, that would mean out of those two point eight million total jumps, there were about hundred mouth functions and only eleven deaths. Still, Yeah, so if you had, if you had, I think you're right, you know me and math too, So that's that was impressive. Now that one's pretty straightforward, I think. So out of there ish malfunctions, there were only eleven death so your chances of surviving a malfunction are still really really great. Yeah. So there were a couple of people um that kind of famously survived. There was a woman named Victoria's Sillers whose nefarious evil husband tampered with her parachute to kill her, and she survived a drop from four thousand feet. A few years what happened to him? He went to prison. A guy named Michael Holmes jumped to two miles three point two kilometers. That's how far he dropped to the earth without his shote deploying. But he happened to land in some BlackBerry bushes and he lived. Um, are you do feel bad for the BlackBerry bushes? No? I thought that was a very sweet nice And I'm just picturing this person landing and reaching over and picking a BlackBerry. And for some reason that all sounded like you were sympathizing, like what the BlackBerry bushes? Do you deserve that? And now, of course this guy is probably listening. He's like, yeah, ad a BlackBerry with my stomach collapse. Right. But then the queen of all this chuck, the Queen Champion, was a woman named Vesna Vulovich, who in nineteen seventy two was a flight attendant on board the Yugoslav air flight that they suspect had a bomb. At any case, it came apart at thirty three thousand feet and she kept in the tail pinned between the wall or the back of the tail or the back of the plane and a service cart, dropped thirty three thousand feet out of the air and survived. Wow, isn't that crazy. Wow, that is Yeah, that's startling. Can you imagine like her just shakily, like putting a cigarette in her mouth and like walking away from the landing. Because this was Yugoslavi in n there's a hundred and ten percent chance that she smoked cigarettes. Yes, of course, unfiltered. You've got anything else, man, I got nothing else to pull that shoot, whip it out and when it doesn't work for sure to say shoot, well that's it for short stuff every pay we're out.
