Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles T. W Chuck Bryant, There's Jerry So it's Stuff you should know. The Chinese Edition, right, which probably isn't even hurt in China. Yeah, we say that, and then we always hear from people like, no, you're not banned. I get to hear you guys all the time actually promote you for being such communist lackeys. They're like, they send a guy to my house to read your transcripts right at gunpoint. Uh, yeah, this is the China edition. And you wrote this too, didn't you. Yep, just an old one. Yep, you just dug it out from the old memory banks. Yeah. It was on the list. I think I just ran across it randomly and I was like, oh, yeah, this one pretty interesting and think yeah, I think so too. So um. One of the things that interested me was I did it. I got to do like some historical research on it. Initially, Are you familiar with the Sino Russian conflicts along the border starting in the mid seventeenth century, the uh roman Off Czars versus the Manchu in later Ming dynasties. I'm more familiar now than I ever have been before in my life, let's put it that way. So but it did surprise me. I just kind of thought, I don't know, I didn't know much about Comy Heart Commy, right, Yeah, yeah, I mean that's what I would have thought too, UM, And apparently I did at some point. But now once I started researching, turns out those guys didn't like each other so much, and it it actually did go back to the six hundreds for sure, where UM China apparently didn't trade outside of China and UM didn't have any diplomats. The emperor controlled all trade with with other countries, and it was through a system of trip you where like you give the emperor the best stuff you got and he'll see what he wants to give you back. UM. And the Russians didn't like that very much, so they just kind of we're a little more tense, a little more tense, not the best of neighbors. But then yeah, after World War Two when UM Russia starts taking over Eurasia and China follows of the Union rather right, thank you, And then China follow suit with Mause Dun's Communist Revolution. Um. Then, Yeah, basically this whole area was red, and that's how we were taught to view it. Right, it's all red, so it's all the same. But that's that's very much an oversimplification of the geopolitics of that area. Yeah, like you said, Commy Hart, Commy, that's kind of what I always thought was that they were neighbors. They were politically aligned in the broadest sense, so they what what issues would they have? But as usual, it's like Nancy Reagan said, kill all the commie He's like, God, sort them out. You remember that Saturday Morning cartoons. Um, as usual, the beef is in the land and neighbors. Oftentimes, whether it's a Georgia and Tennessee fighting over a river it's water, or it's um Israel and Palestine, there are a lot of neighbors that say no, that that stuff is ours, not yours. And that seems like to be the the heart of the beef between China and Russia. So I think that the the border disputes were actually a symptom of a larger thing, which was which was so MAW Chairman Mao used to publicly deride the Soviets as revisionists, that they'd abandoned the roots of revolutionary communism and it were basically sellouts. Interesting, yeah, and he used to publicly say this stuff about him, and the Russians would be like, we're sticky you now, you're you're you talk too much trash, shut up, uh, and he would talk more trash, Like he criticized um Khrushchev for backing down from the human missile crisis stuff like that, Right, it's really like poking them a lot, and the Soviets, in retaliation withdrew all military and economic support, and then they recalled all of like the scientists that were over there working on joint projects, and the scientists all left with the blueprints to whatever they were working on, even if it was Chinese technology. So there was like a lot of tensions, and it seemed to erupt in the border disputes rather than it was over the border distructions, you know what I mean. So what we when we say erupt, we mean erupt with gunfire. And then uh, the spring of nineteen sixty nine, some bad stuff went down and marched. Specifically, there was an attack on a patrol boat. Um what was the name of the river, the Usuri River, and that's in the eastern border of China, of course, and twenty four Soviets were left dead and stuff got real after that. Yeah, the Soviets were like, okay, it's like that, yea. So they rolled into the area with tanks, they used missiles, aircraft and took out like eight hundred Chinese and retaliation that same year, yes, only losing about sixty of their own, which was a big victory. And so they said, you see that there's more where that came from, if you don't mind your peas and cues. Yeah, And they were saying this to using the New York Times as this like international mouthpiece, basically threatening one another through the international press. China said, what are peas and cues? We we don't have those letters. Well, they have cues and peas well as you know. It's just a joke. Um. So mouse Tong says, I understand that this. You're coming after us now, Um, I think we should have a plan in place because I don't want you creeping into let's say Beijing, our capital with all your tanks like you did along the river there. So here's what we'll do. Six of the population, go red dawn and head for the hills. Uh the other Um, here's what we'll do. Let's all get to work building an underground bunker, but one that can house of our seven million, which is quite hit that that number was that about two point eight millions something like that. Okay, they made enough for three thousand people. It's not even close, but it's still a pretty neat accomplishment that they created. Right. Yeah, and this is um what would be become known as do you know how to pronounce it? It's exactly like it's spelled. I looked it up, so go ahead. Dixia Chang. Okay, I thought that was Chinese for Dixie Chicks. I thought it would might have been Disha Chang or something. But yeah, I thought so too. That's why I was like, I'm not getting this one wrong. I looked it up and I couldn't find it. I found there's I don't remember the site, but there's a site where I guess users submit and say what what language they speak naturally? Naturally um, So then it will have like this whole list of like, you know, um Spanish from Catalonia or um like Spanish spoken by Mexican person or Scandinavian or whatever. But if you listen to all of them, they're all saying it the same way. DIXIEA Chang. It's funny some people say shang, but it's wrong in the uh in the office here, I know people think we probably never look up pronunciations, but we do. And YouTube has a lot of them. Now you know where they will that little thing will spin and reveal the word, and then the polite lady computer lady will say it. But here in the office a lot because it's not worth it to get out the headphones for just that. So like I'll hear strickling to the left or Holly over there the right or me, and you'll just hear random computers all day long with like Dixia Chang or manarchy. Can you just hearr words kind of popping up and everyone's like, sorry, sorry, but I think we all get it. Yeah, alright, so Dixia Chang, And I mean we should say, we'll get to the to the meat of this stuff. But an underground bunker capable of housing three hundred thousand of Beijing's residence was built because Chairman Mao got paranoid that the Soviets were going to invade. Also, to a lesser extent, he was worried about American imperialism extending to China. But really he was worried the Soviets were going to either invade or launch some nukes on his people. Um. It was like my dad when we saw the day after exactly, except he just put my brother and I to work, whereas the chairman put I think it was three hundred thousand people. I found that somewhere. Three thousand was how many people it could it could house. I thought I was three hundred thousand working. Maybe it was more than that even No, I see what you're talking about. There's three hundred thousand right there. But um, you know, women, children, men, all kinds of people digging by hand. Yeah, we found this really cool um blog posts from like two thousand and ten by a guy named Anthony Tao Um or Dow, depending on uh, I guess how you say it, um, And he said that it was basically like an urban exploration posts. There's a lot of pictures of this abandoned stuff. It's really cool. But it turns out his relatives, including his mother, helped build this, so that he includes some of their recollections in it where they're like, um, like yeah, we used to go to school. Then you'd come home from school and you'd work like several hours building this, like making bricks or digging or something like that. And so this excavation was being carried out by the very people who were going to use it as part of this um this cultural revolution, this great communist experiment that Chairman Mau was carrying out, like, everybody, just get to work because the Russians might invade. And he said, very famously, um, shen madong changji li yang, I'm not saying this correctly, and then boo chang bah, which means it means dig deep tunnels, store food, and prepare for war. He told his population that, and that's what kicked off this thing in nineteen sixty nine. He really like to get to the point. Yeah, uh yeah, nineteen sixty nine to nineteen seventy nine is when this was going on. And uh, we'll take a little break here and tell you a little bit about Dixie Chang.

I'm not going to pronounce in the E in words like pen. I say pen pen like P P I N E N chang. Yeah, we got it alright. So this you say Dixie, I'll say chang. You say Dixie, I'll say chang DIXIEA chang terrible? So, uh what lies underground beneath? About twenty six to sixty feet depending on where you are. There are eighteen miles roughly of tunnels. Supposedly it connects every district in the city. Yeah, and for those of us who don't live in the US or Liberia, that's thirty kilometers of basically underground living space fifty two square miles five kilometers squared. And um, it was calling an undertaking. Was as an understatement. It was a big deal, requiring lots of hands. Yeah. So they used a lot of the old city gates, um, the city walls as construction material. But again they were also making their own bricks and they weren't using like back hose or anything like that. They were using shovels and removing dirt with bamboo baskets and making their own bricks on site. Um. And they constructed this this is just amazing labyrinth of of not just tunnels, but also they had bomb shelters. In the bomb shelter, they had ventilation shafts that were designed to keep out um fallout and contamination from nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons. I guess they built a great wall. They're like, yeah, this is nothing exactly. Um. They had recreational stuff too, like a movie theater. I think a roller skating rink, basketball courts. Yeah, they had a barber shop, they had restaurants, um, they had if you wanted to get down in here. This is kind of the coolest part to me is there were about ninety different entrances um around the city that were sometimes in parks, sometimes in a private home, sometimes in a shop that you needed a black light to read a special map on the wall. It's like kind of neat when you think about it like that. Oh yeah it is. It's like all the residents of Beijing or clued into this this big secret, you know, this official secret. Yeah, it is like a speakeasy, except those places. Come on, didn't that kind of hadn't that run its course? Uh? Yeah, Like they just opened one in Atlanta right here next door to us. Where at the City Winery. Oh really there's a speakeasy day? Yeah, now there's a speakeasy downstairs. If you know the code word, you say it at the unmarked door. What's the co Man? New York did this twenty years ago? What's the cod this week? Actually wrote it down. So I'm going to a show there tomorrow night. They have shows at the Speak even will know. At the City Winery. Um, I'm going to see Blitz and Trapper my boys. Wow. Yeah, they're doing like this acoustic storyteller tour. It's neat. Yeah. Apparently if you go there and you say you know Miss Violet this week, they'll let you in. It's I'm gonna go down there and make fun of them and probably get a drink and leave a big tip. Yeah, that's what you gotta do. That's right. You're gonna go there and it's gonna be overrun with people. I just wonder if you go to one of these places, especially in Atlanta, like I get it. In New York when they're supplying demand, they can literally say no, turn around and go home. But in Atlanta, I would be like, dude, come on, I don't know the password. Just let me in the freaking building. And if they literally say no, then they're dead to me. In fact, on the I'm not gonna say I know Miss Violet. Oh yeah, you're gonna test them, huh. I'm gonna say no, Miss Scarlett. Let me know how that pans out. Well, Ms Scarlett, I'll send you a text of either me sitting on the sidewalk drink drinking. Yes, this, it's a substitute. I used to drink the occasional forty in college, back when you thought you were cool to do so because the Beastie boys did it. Yeah, like, drink this swill and it's totally hot after about the first like ten minutes. Well, you have to hold it up around the neck. Oh, is that the deal? Like Champagne I was. I never got to the bomb because I was pouring some out for my homies. That's pretty thoughtful of you. So where were we speakeasies? That's right? Uh no, even further back than that. Well, yeah, that this the complex. And by the way, Dixie Ching literally means underground city. Yeah, like that's it. You don't even capitalize it. Yeah, it was never used because, um, the Big Apocalypse never happened. Well not only that chair amount and apparently I didn't know this, but shortly after he died, I think in the seventies, Um, his cultural revolution seems to have died with him, which was news to me because I thought that China was communists to the core up until a couple of years ago. But apparently there was a real opening of their culture, um, like starting pretty much and slowly and incrementally right after Chairman Mao's death, um and so I saw a bunch of different stuff. This is part of the problem with researching China without ever going to China, because like the dispatches you read from the place where you know, they just very wildly in the the accounts. And this is a good example that I saw somewhere that um uh they so Chairman MoU died nineteen six as saw that by one they had the place open for tours and it costs like ten Chinese cents a ticket, and that you if you were Chinese, you could not even get in. It was only for tourists. I saw in my own article that they boarded up and forgot about it, and it wasn't until like two thousand that people like started to find their way in. I had the same problem. I was trying to find out like literally the current state, because I saw that in two thousand eight uh, in preparation for the Olympics they closed it for renovations and it's still not open um And I've tried to find out like the most recent information. I couldn't. So I'm going with not even myself. I'm not even going with my own article, the article where they recounted that it was ten Chinese cents a ticket to get in back in one. I'm thinking that's probably right. So you're going with that because it has numbers in it, right, this thing is legitimate. All right, Well, let's take our final break here and we'll come back and talk a little bit about the rat tribe of Beijing. So Chuck um. One of the first things that happened, whether it was in or two thousand, was people started to move into this area illegally. And at first I get the impression that they opened up businesses and there was actually like an official stretch like about a one kilometer stretch of dixiea Chang that was open for tours like underground Atlanta. Yes, But then the other like twenty nine kilometers were closed off permanently and frozen in time. Right. Well, that kind of stuff attracts people like moths to a flame, especially like urban explorers. Um. And again, go check out Anthony Tao's post last visit to Beijing's underground City. It's got some great photos of this abandoned stuff. But over the years there are people who have you know, worked their way into like the other shut off twenty nine kilometers and have reported back that it's just like eerie a time capsulers like posters of Chairman Mao on the walls with um slogans like dig the tunnels deep, accumulate grain opposed to geminy. Yeah, pictures of it. It's pretty neat, right, And then get this if you were let's say, like um, Ronald Reagan had told us all this when we were kids for the people prepare for war, prepare for famine. It's kind of unsettling when they keep you on your toes. Um. So there's a lot of it that's like just this kind of rotting time capsule. Because again, like you said, it was never used, but then plenty of it has been used. Yeah, And that that's I couldn't even figure out for sure. These are definitely parts of that complex where people are living. Yes, okay, I didn't know if it was other shelters. It's both, Okay, it's both got You're right, all right, So what we're talking about or is the rat tribe or the sho zoo uh. And it's basically about a million people. They don't know exact numbers, but about a million people in Beijing have moved underground, um about a million of the one million people who lived there. Yeah, and if if you talk about a population boom in there were about nine million people in Beijing, now there's twenty one million. UM. That's a lot of people and not a very long span of time. So uh, it's expensive to I really don't know that like median incomes compared to housing. But this article made it seem like the only reason these people were doing it is because they can't afford to live above ground, or that there's just such a shortage, Like your your choice is this. You can live above ground in a door rom like room with six to ten people in the suburbs and pay about what you would pay for your own room below ground, which is about fifty to seventy American dollars a month. Right, So you want to go a little with six to ten people in a dorm mountain suburbs, or you want your own cozy, little eight ft by eight foot concrete room underground. A lot of people are saying I'd rather be underground, and they're normal people, they're not Um, it's not like a situation like, uh, I'm trying to think of something comfarable. But this woman interviewed a lot of these people. Uh and net Kim from USC southern California. Go Trojans for our friend Brian Bishop. Oh yeah, congratulations to Brian on the birth of his child. Yeah that too. So what she found out was that as she suspected, these are computer programmers and waiters and waitresses and uh barbaras and they are literally just mainly migrants that have come there from the countryside to work. And they're not weirdos. They just they're like, you know, this is what I can afford. I have a job above ground, and h this is just what I how I choose to live because we don't have a lot of options. So there's like the specter of MAO is still around because apparently part of the UM the housing code in China or in Beijing at least, requires that if you are going to build like a building, you have to build something between one to three stories of basement or um bomb shelter below ground. That's still the thing. Yeah, so um in addition to people squatting in dixia Chang, which does happen, these people are going to the owners of the building and saying can I please stay here. I'll give you seventy bucks a month. Yeah, they like sure, and even though it's illegal. Yeah, the owners are like, yeah, just leave it, leave it under the trash can out front and I'll come find Yeah, like I'm not using that tiny room, right because these are you know, small spaces. They're communal toilets uh and showers. You gotta pay like fifty cents for a shower for five minutes, is that right? Yeah, I didn't see that. Yeah. There's this um photographer Sim Chi Yen based in Beijing and he has a collection called China's Rat Tribe if you want to look at pictures, and um, you know it's not there's a stigma to it. First of all, a because it's illegal. They call him the rat Tribe and be yeah, because you know, they interviewed some of these people and the guy was like yeah, my dad was like, son, no, you can't. You can't live down here. And he's like, Dad, this is what I can afford. I've got a job and I don't want to live with ten people in a room and there's no windows, it's dark. Apparently there's signs in some of these tunnels. It advised people to go up and get fun stuff like that. It's thoughtful, sure. Um. I think one of the other reasons too why they're considered like the rat tribe is in a lot of the cases they're living beneath um fairly tony apartment buildings. So the people above ground there's like a huge class difference in the same like sprout of of living space in Beijing, and the people above ground are not in contact with the people below ground, and they do not trust them. They're weird, they're different, they're poor, they're from the country. Um, so they don't they don't communicate with one another, but they know they're there. So the people above ground are very suspicious of the people below ground. H Yeah, apparently mold is a problem, yeah, because it's you know, undergrounds kind of dank, so they have to work to keep mold at bay. And I don't think we mentioned that the original plan too, with Chairman Maus to grow things like mushrooms, like things that you didn't need the sun right to grow down there. You know how fast you wed get sick of eating mushrooms if that's all you had to eat. If it was me, it would be one bite of mushroom later you don't like mushrooms, can't do it? What if you put soy sauce and mayonnaise on it? I mean I could choke it down. But it's a texture thing for me. Uh yeah, you know it's not even the taste. What about uncooked raw It's almost got like a bit of a crunch to it. I'll try one. Yeah, yeah, try like a white button mushroom, little salt like lick at first. Put a little salt on it. Think a bit. It's not like the mushroom you're describing that that slimy texture doesn't have that although wash it off first. Yeah yeah, you give it a good scrub with your tongue. I'll bring you one. I don't want to work. Actually, I have one here in my pocket. I'm good, okay, pocket mushrooms. No you got anything else? Uh no? Do you know? Oh? I do have one other thing. Um. So they were a long time. There were long standing rumors that they had built like secret tunnels in this underground bunker Dixie chang Um that connected to like the People's Hall and other government buildings, and no one knew if it was real or not until when the ten m and Square uprising happened, and all of a sudden, all these government troops come out of nowhere, flooding out of the People's Hall to quell these protesters. They're like, oh, those underground tunnels really are real. Yeah, And apparently there's only out of the ninety original entrances. There's only a handful of those left. Yeah, because the the the area where this was built beneath is the called ken Mien I believe for kenyan Um, and it's a very famous stretch of like shops uh in Beijing, and it's been just recreated and rebuilt so much, especially since right before the Olympics that a lot of these olds are being leveled and there there to go the entrances to the places and the fluorescent maps. So it is in danger of being lost, but it'll still be there for people to go find. Yeah. Go check out the pictures. Pretty neat. Yeah. Uh. If you want to know more about Beijing, type that word in the search part how stuff works dot com see what comes up. Press your luck. Since I said press your luck, it's time for listener mail Ah. This was about the mining episode. So it's been a bit but um, we always like good information. So here it is. I've been listening to your show for about a year now, been blissfully enlightened on so many topics. Currently pursuing my master's degree in economic geology. Whoa uh in the unlikely state of Iowa, and I have a few friendly clarifications. On your mining episode, you mentioned hard and soft rock mining, and we're unsure of the difference between the two whether it comes for the rock or the ore. The term soft and hard rock mining relates to the hardness of the rock from which the ore is being extracted, not the ore itself, so that clears that up good. I think that's what I said. I don't remember, actually, I think I hedged and said it could be either one, so that was right right either way. Uh So, soft rock mining typically pertains to sedimentary rock, where's hard rock typically pertains to igneous or metamorphic rocks. Furthermore, just finish your wonderful episode on ice ages and giggled a little from your pronunciation of Lois. I was always told it was pronounced luss, and even though Lois is a bit more fun to say, I just thought i'd let you guys know, keep up the amazing work. Thanks for making my ears happy. And Megan, that is exactly how you send in corrections in a very nice, friendly way, and that's how you get on the air, right exactly. And we we love our corrections, uh, and we tend to favor the ones that are hospitable because it's just nice in life, right. Thanks Megan, Thank you for the demonstration. Top notch.
