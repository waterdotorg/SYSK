Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant and Jerry Rowland, which makes this stuff you should know. It's right. I got on my top hat and cane your monocle monic to see a monocle. I thought it was not this' Mr Peanut. Oh yeah, not Mr Monopoly. And I think Mr Pringle has a monocle too, don't you know, he says an anostatic. Mr Monopoly doesn't have a monocle. Huh, I don't think so. Huh. You'd think we'd know. We do not, But I do know this Mr Monopoly is a nickname for that man. That's right. His born name is given name by his parents is rich Uncle Pennybags. Three names, so uncle would be his middle name. Yeah. Well he even has a regular name too. Oh not that I saw. Yeah, it is Um Millburn Pennybags. No. Yeah, there was a book Um published and this is one of those after the fact deals called the Monopoly Companion, and they named all the character characters on the board Milbourne Penny Bags. And then the jail guy is Jake. The jailbird and the police officer and go to jail is I'll bet a tyrus, isn't it? Well, Officer Edgar Mallory, I really do you just gets that? Yeah, that's pretty funny. We're talking about Monopoly, by the way. Oh yeah, this is not about anything else but Monopoly. No. And I was just remarking to you, sir, how I've never seen one of our This had more supplemental information than most shows that we research. Yeah. I can explain why because this was written. There was a whole suite of UM game articles written like um just how to play certain games. So it kind of came out in this mentality and of this is the game, and here's how we explain how to play it, and this article is done. Whereas Monopoly, it's like this is more like McDonald's or Twinkies or something like that. It's like a cultural cog. Yeah. I mean there's so much extra junk history. And I mean you talk about the different versions, it's ridiculous Milburn Penny pennybags. Yeah. And like I said, that was a post that he wasn't originally called that. This is I think Monopoly probably wanted to sell a little a Little Book or two. I'm sure they did. Because if one thing we've learned about Parker Brothers and now has Bro is they love selling different versions of this game. Yeah, they do. They like licensing it off a lot of money. They like making some changes. Here they're releasing a brand new game, but it's all still the same game and all of it, Um came from a left wing Quaker intellectual at the turn of the last century. Yeah it was. I'm saying that, right, Yeah, sure, okay, let it sounds right. Uh. And it's interesting to me that the game of Monopoly, which is all about capitalism, bankrupting or neighbor was stolen. The game was stolen from a leftist intellectual Quaker. In the original version of the game, it was to teach against the monopolies and how they were bad. Right, So let's talk about this monopoly. Actually, if you trace it back to about the like the literal beginning of the twentieth century, Um, it's what's considered a folk game. There were a lot of people playing versions like this and cities all over the country. But again, they all shared some pretty common viewpoints. Uh. I guess you today you would kind of call them socialists, um, but for the most part they were um followers of a guy named Henry George. Yeah, he came up with this thing called Georgism, which was based on some other philosophies. But the idea of it is is that if you produce something through the through your own labor, your own work, you own that that should not be taxed. What should be taxes things that everybody owns. If somebody's taking something that belongs to everybody, say a parcel of land, technically the land belongs everybody. Well, that was his notion was that you shouldn't even be a landowner. Whole concept of owning land to him was ridiculous. And that's based on this idea the law of the Commons, which is around for centuries, if not millennia, and then um, once people started taking land, He's like, okay, well, if you're gonna own land, it belongs to everybody, so that should be taxed and then that tax will be given back to the community for the greater good. So that's Georgeism, and that was kind of the philosophy that formed the basis of monopoly what was originally called the Landlord's Game, which is created by a lady named Lizzie Maggie m A G y m A g I e almost Magpie without the pe right, uh. And she basically was on her card and she uh, she came up with this, like you said, to kind of teach um, so you could go and be a rich landowner and bankrupt other people and exploit the poor who need your help, um, who need a decent place to stay, and you could see yourself like the evils of capitalism. But she actually came up with two sets of rules for the same game. One was where you got as rich as you could at the expense of everybody else. The other was a basically the community benefited. And you can kind of see that today and like these weird things like community chest, like why would I want to you know, pay into this pot. I don't care about the commune in the like now it's a bad thing. In her original version, it was a good thing, like the community one, and that was the basis of the whole thing. Yeah, which is really ironic, it is uh. Yeah, like you said, she created two versions, and she said, Um. One of the quotes from her is it is a practical demonstration of the present system of land grabbing with all its usual outcomes and consequences. So you know, it's kind of to teach people lessons. H and she had it stolen from her. Luckily, Lizzie, Maggie was smart enough to patent this game. Uh. It became just kind of a trendy thing. Again, like if you were uh into socialism at the time and you were on the East Coast, you probably hung out at a friend's house and and um played this game at some point in some incarnation or another. Yeah, it was really popular, like you said, like people made up some of their own rules, but it was if I mean, if you look at the original Landlords game board, it looks a lot like the or Monopoly, I mean similar at least. Yeah, and apparently a lot of the the rules that make the game a lot more enjoyable today came from uh Lizzie's quicker friends. Like, for example, um, the original plots of land we're up for auction for for bide. Quakers prefer silence, so they just put a fixed price on the piece of land so there wouldn't be a loud, obnoxious bidding war. Um. They also um instituted tokens fun tokens before they were just boring ponds. Yeah, like household objects, which you know, that's why the fimble is in there, and originally the iron. We'll get to those in a minute, but um, it's pretty exciting. Uh. And then so this thing is being played and Lizzie Maggie holds the patent, but she's not exactly like um cracking down on any kind of infringement. Really. Well, she pitched at the Parker Brothers and they said no, Yeah, so she just kind of went on doing her own thing. So there's another lady actually that figures into this um. The lady named Ruth Hoskins, and she was one of the ones who caught on in the like Philadelphia, Atlantic City area with her Quaker friends, uh, two of them in particular, Jessie and Eugene Rayford. Uh. And they are the ones who changed some of the rules to make it look more like the monopoly we know. They taught it to a friend, uh named Todd, and Todd taught it to his friend named Charles Darrow. And that's where the story takes a kind of a ceed turn. Well actually that's where the Parker Brothers official version begins. Ironically turned CD Brothers is like, hey, this is where our story begins. Yeah. The inventor of Monopoly, Charles Darrow A right, so he was like a radiator salesman during the depression. This is the thirties, right, Yeah, I mean it was ironically again during the depression, this game really caught hold. Well, I supposedly that's what caught the Parker brothers attention was that this guy came to came to him, came to them to sell him this game which he had stolen. Yeah. Apparently he didn't innovate it at all. He kind of just copied it and packaged it right, and said, hey, what do you think of this? And the Parker Brothers said, we don't think too much of it, Like how does the game end? We don't know what's going on here, so let's just, um, you just go your own way. So Charles Darrow went off and started selling it at this Wannamaker's department store in Philadelphia without pattenting it, right, and um, the Parker Brothers said, you know what, it's the depression, can you believe it. We're not going to have any kind of economic woes like this for another seventy eighty years. And this guy is selling these things like hotcakes. You know what, sir, we will buy your idea from you. And Charles Darrow apparently said, well, that's great. Give me the money first and then I'll tell you the second part of the story. And they gave him a bag of money with a dollar sign on it, much like the ones that um rich uncle Penny bags likes, and he said, okay, um, we also need to buy the patent off from this lady named Lizzie Maggie. Yeah, which they did. Um, the game was still stolen, I say, even though that they eventually did pay her money. But part of the deal was they said, um, they they agreed to buy her pattent and said, you know what we're gonna we'll sell a few of your other game ideas too. None of those ever went anywhere, and she was sort of lost to history except for people who do a little bit of digging. Yeah, and we actually have a guy named Ralph to thank for doing that digging initially. We'll talk about him later. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, because he's the one who came up with the unofficial history and like really tracked it down. Boy, there's a lot of teasers in this one so far so Um, the Parker brothers now in the game, and uh, it becomes a huge hit virtually off the bat. In the thirties is when they bought it and started really printing it. Yeah, and the game is based on Atlantic City. Uh, those are the properties, and that's because that was the area where it became popular. But um, this excellent New York Times article you sent, uh, what's the name of it? Monopoly Goes Corporate. Yeah, it was written by what's the what's the lady's name, Mary Pillin. She is a monopoly expert. There's a lot of those out there, I've learned. She well, she wrote a lot of the articles you'll find. Oh really, yeah, she's well. She pointed out that it's interesting that it mirrored sort of the the cartography of the day in Atlantic City, like Boardwalk was clearly like a rich area the Baltic and Mediterranean. The cheapest properties were in African American neighborhoods. There was a reading railroad that transferred people between Philly and Atlantic City. And little known fact for our friends in the gay community, New York Avenue was one of the earliest gay scenes in the country. Yeah, oh, buy that one up and support support the lb GT community that you're playing monopoly. Yeah, that's what I would do. And maybe just you know, don't charge anybody when they land, just be like this is the party place exactly. And Marvin Gardens apparently is misspelled yeah, E instead of an eye or eye instead of an E. Yeah, on the board it's an eye. It's supposed to be an E. Yeah. There's a lot of Monopoly facts dropping all around us right now. I know it's raining thimbles. Before we go any further, though, you want to do a message break, Yes, okay, we'll be right packed what you want, all right, So we were just talking about Atlantic City. Um, I guess it's we can go ahead and point out now that there are hundreds of versions of Monopoly out there, now, one for your hometown, probably one for your favorite sports team. I have personally my version as a Star Wars Monopoly, which is pretty fun. Um. Yeah, I guess hes pro is like you've got some money, sure you can license this, make your Monopoly game. Go ahead. There's a Simpsons Monopoly. I haven't played it though, and not in addition to the um licensed versions that you can find like everywhere They also have like official versions to like there's a U S version, there's a UK version, there's um a, there's a new version that's called monopoly here and now what does that even mean? Super corporate? Is this the corporate one? Yeah? Okay, it's uh, it's like everything is multiplied by I think a thousand, so the dollar amounts are way higher. Is this one where they replaced the uh, the railroads are replaced by airports? Is this one where they replaced corporations for all the property? So? Yes, like McDonald's, sony and god, who would want to play that? Some people? Do? You know? Yeah? H um. I mean I'm not a purist because I had the Star Wars version, but just it's no fun to me to play as paramount pictures and to buy the McDonald's property. Yeah, it's just me. Um. So there are a bunch of different versions, but the one we're going to talk about, we'll just talk about the the normal version with the two thousand eight rules. Yeah, and there's actually coming soon um later this year. There you can go online at my Monopoly and you can design your own board, is that right? And do like your own neighborhood and then they will make it for you, and I think it's like fifty bucks or something. Wow, money bags, you can I'm not gonna do it. You gonna do the East Lake. But I was. I was talking to whoever went and got Yeah, rich uncle, rich penny bags. That's what you should have said, rich uncle, penny bag, penny bags. This sounds not not that wealthy. Well, actually I have a bag of pennies on me right now. He Forbes has their silly fictional fifteen list of fictional characters wealth and he um in two thousand thirteen was number is Uh stars declined to m huh, guess who the first? The richest fictional character is the Incredible Hulk. No, he was not rich Scrooge McDuck. Oh yeah, well dude, he had that gold vault apparently sixty five billion. Uh. Number two was smiling, which I thought it was kind of silly smile from like the rings. It's the dragon. I think I had like a bunch of gold. Uh. Carlisle Cullen number three, Tony Stark four, Charles Foster Kane number five? Who's number three? Carlisle Cullen from Twilight? Who's that? He was the dad vampire Dad of the vampire family. Um, and he's been alive forever, so I guess he just keeps accumulating. Well, Bruce Wayne Ritchie Rich, Christian Gray Ritchie Rich. I forgot about him. He's number seven. He had a robot made and crazy like a weird scientists friend, didn't he Sure like a Richie Rich robot of himself. I think he had that too, But no, it's made. Was a robot, wasn't it? That was the Jetsons. No, he had a Uh. I thought Monty Burns at number ten was pretty good. Oh yeah, that's good, although I would guess Mr Monopoly would be wealthier than Monty Burns. But and they put it out each year and it's duma. Can we just admit that I was thrilled by it. We just spent three minutes on it. Yeah, well that's true. Okay, So Chuckers, you want to talk about the the rules of the game again? Two rules if you are a Monopoly purist and like, I'm sorry, this is what we're going with. Yeah, well, let's talk about the game board itself, just so if you haven't played it, I'm surprised because I think like a billion people to play the game. Um, but if you haven't, when you get your Monopoly game, you're gonna open it up and you're gonna have a board with all these different properties in a square. Uh, you you have two dice twelve they call them tokens. That's not the right amount either, is it. No, there's eight. Yeah. I don't understand where they got twelve from unless they're counting ones that maybe were retired or something like that. But when you open the box, there's only eight. There, there's a can we go over, there's a wheelbarrow, Scottie dog, top hat, a cat which replaced the iron in two thousand thirteen. There's a big, big to do because Parker Brothers has Bro was like, we haven't made a lot of money off of this for a couple of months, so let's just do something. Well, they let people vote at least, which is kind of cool, right, but it was also did you see the other ones that they were voting for. It's like a robot like Ritchie Rich's main a guitar. They didn't make the cut though, No, they got voted out and the cat got voted in. Yeah, the iron got booted. Yeah, it only got eight percent of the vote. There's the classic shoe of course or boot, which is modeled after the nineteen thirties working shoe, and I think they've kept it the same. Yeah, that's one of the original ones. The Scottie Dog was not one of the origins that came in the fifties. Yeah, and I think that was supposed to be the companion of uh millburn money Denny bags should be cash bags, fat stacks stacks bag. There was a cannon which has since been retired. Yeah, and two militaries, well, the cannon and the battleship. Yeah. They were from a failed game called Conflict, and they were like, well, we got all these pieces, so let's just throw them in Monopoly for now. It's pretty smart. But they faced the cannon out because it's just too overtly violent. Um, it just says with any without any fanfare or vote or campaign. So probably, yeah, be my guess. If it's hush hush, yeah, it's probably kind of violence. There's a conspiracy of foot. There's the race car. Yeah, every little kid's favorite, which apparently had a number three on the side for a little while. Yeah. I didn't know that they were in hard I guess so, uh or purse has been retired. The rocking horse was retired, the lantern was retired. Yeah, I'm doing my best Ben Bowl impressing. Did you do did you get wheelbarrow in there yet? I think I know, yes I did. It was the first one I said, Did you say top hat? Yeah? That was always my favorite. Actually, I don't remember what my favorite was. It fit on my pinking and I used to draw faces. Uh the horse and rider, which is retired, which I didn't know. That's one of the best pieces to me. What you didn't know is retired. Now I'm just kind of sad. Yeah, and now there and that stack of money was retired as well, the sack of money and a purse. Those are a little similar. Yeah. The cat come on, yeah, cat people, that's exactly right. I guarantee that's why they got cat voted in. And I am a cat person, you know, and even you think it's stupid. So those are the tokens. Some of those tokens that we mentioned you're going to find in the two thousand and eight set, and that is your piece. That is what represents you in the game. Again for the three people who have never played Monopoly, right, yeah, because supposedly, um, at least as far as Hasbro calculates, over one billion people have played Monopoly, and frankly, I'm surprised it's that low. It sounds like an old number. Yeah. Um, okay, So you've got the box open, you get the board, you got two dice, you got the tokens, thirty two houses in, twelve hotels, uh, sixteen chance cards, sixteen community chest cards. Yeah, a title D card for each property. It's got the information on it, like how much it cost to purchase, how much rent is depending on how many houses or hotels you have on it? Yeah, what the mortgage value is worth, that's right. Um. And then you've got your your play money, your monopoly money. Yeah. Man, I think that's where it grabs kids because and they even pointed out in this article that's. Um, it's kind of the first time a lot of kids have money to play with. Yeah, especially the Bill wants. Oh man, that gold Bill always thought was orange? Is it gold? Uh? Yeah, one's definitely golden rod like yellow. What I remember? Yeah, I guess gold is the way to go. Uh. See, I was a cash hoarder, which is no way to win a monopoly I thought it was can't save. No, I just just figures for me though, Like you gotta spend money to make money. Yeah, I was like, look at all this cash that I will soon be paying to everyone else. You just keep wandering off from the table and try to buy stuff with it did not work. So Chuck, you got the board laid out, and if you count them, if you're that kind of person, yeah, you're gonna find that there's forty squares, that's right. I believe, twenty two of which are um no, twenty eight of which can be purchased. Yeah, twenty two or properties. You've got your your electric company and water works. Yeah, sucker's bet. And then you've got the four railroads. Four railroads, So that's that's right. There are others that you can't buy. So, for example, there's a luxury tax square. Yeah, you gotta pay what a hundred dollars when you land on that, I believe, so right out of just right out of your pocket. If there's an income tax square, yeah, no good. There's the go square, which is where you start and then when you come back around you collect two hundred dollars, which is in monopoly called your salary that's right. I never knew that. I didn't either, And there's a lot of rules in here. Uh. And then I guess it's a good time to point out Monopoly is one of those games where house rules are highly encouraged, uh and a lot of the of the game, and in fact, to make more money, Monopoly this year had are incorporating the top house rules as voted on by fans as official rules for this one version in a seventy dollar hardback book. I don't see why a lot of people were in since they were like no one placed by the real rules anyway, So why bother packaging it and selling it? And they went, I think you just said the words sell someone's they sell. There in lies the answer. So you've got, oh, there's and so there's forty squares, but there's actually forty one places you can go to on the board because jail is divided into two squares. You got the jail with the jailbird. What's his name, Uh, I can't remember, jailbird or something. Jake the jailbird, right, okay, which is where Jake the jailbird is. And then you've got the lower part of it. Um, it's just visiting. Yeah, if you want to visit Jake, give him a bunt cake with the nail filing would be very old school or monopoly set with um maybe a map with an escape route embedded in it. Hey, that sounds familiar. POWs and World War Two were given such monopoly sets. True, It's is strange to meybe, It's like where the Nazis allowing monopoly sets to be delivered to POWs. Is that what I'm seeing here? Maybe it's the Burmese. I mean, you've seen the like the Great Escape on those those the war prison camps in World War Two. It seemed like a lot of them they let him like garden and they were kind of chummy with him. He saw Hoggan's heroes, saw Hogans heroes and put a lot of stock into it. Yeah. But yeah, no, I just figured to soccer. Maybe the Japanese or the Burmese or the the Italians I could see like saying like, yeah, he brings the monopoly and who cares. But the Nazis, I would think, would I just don't see that. Yeah, I'm not saying it was a walk in the park, but I think from the depiction and uh, like like I said, like the Great Escape. It's not like Vietnam Prison Camp. Oh yeah, you know, like they weren't playing soccer or Monopoly. They were playing Survive Another Day that game. Um, I'm not making lie of that, by the way. Oh I didn't think you were. And I'm basing everything on more movies, so I'm probably wrong. And I've seen Uncommon Valor that was a good movie that it doesn't age well though. Really remember that menu with the gun silhouettes on it. Oh yeah, and when you're twelves, you're like, oh my god. Yeah, it's like I would buy that one in that one. Um. All right, so where were we we were talking about? Um, the board itself, yes, and the different squares. Yes, there are the cards that you can draw as well, Community chest and chance squares. You land on these you draw a card from one of those two piles, and there are various things in there, like you want to fashion modeling contest you get ten dollars, and their dog show one there too. I think there's probably a dog show and there's also you know, you have street repairs or um those are big time general repairs, and that's based on your properties that you own. That's right. They can they can can teach you pretty hard. Yeah, yeah, that's right, you know. Um, and that's funny because the Monopoly what was her name, Lizzie Maggie in an interview um, she gave with some leftist magazine at the time. Um. She said she basically called the thing the Game of Life. Yeah, that was already taken out. I don't know, was it. Yeah, that was that's around since the Like midd, I thought she was being pressing it. Now she's being glib. She was. She was making a pop culture reference for the time exactly. But did you know apparently there used to be a square on the Game of Life board for suicide. Really it was the way that you could go. I never really played that. I think I played it a couple of times. I never did either. I always thought it was kind of like you get the whole family in the car and it's like whatever. Yeah, we we did, um. I mean we weren't the biggest game players as families, but we did Monopoly some in Yatzi was a big one that I still enjoyed today. I love Yatsu. Yeah. We also played this game called Bull and it was like a stock trading game with cards. And it's just now occurring to me that all these games are just teaching you about life. Yeah, it's like real monopolies, nothing but real estate. Uh, the game of life is everything. This game Bowl was about the stock market. Sorry, it was about um sarcastic. Sorry because you had to say it like a jerk. Candy Land, we know what that's all about. Yeah, drugs, right, probably Shoots and ladders tell you to stay away from snakes. Yeah, operation tell you how to be the door. Oh yeah, that's right, that's right. I got my m D. And then of course, uh, Battleship taught you how to be a warmonger, to risk, can take great pride. Risk taught you to be the Antichrist. Yeah, risk, we should do what. There is an article on risk I saw. I looked it over. It didn't seem as as interesting as this one. Yeah. I don't know if the history is as interesting. And I mean, isn't that what what's interesting about any game, the history of it? Yeah? I think so. So. Um, let's talk about the rules, dude. Okay, let's start at the beginning. We'll start it. Go go. It is where you start, and that's where you like you said, you collect the two hundred every time you land on it or pass it. Sometimes house rules, uh you get four hundred for actually landing on it and only two hundred for passing it. We never good. But free parking is where we had house rules. Um, that is a space on the corner of the board where you supposedly for the official rules, don't do anything. Yeah, there's nothing. It's just a space. But what we did was we donated all the collected taxes and fees and put it under free parking. And if you land on that, that was like a lottery win. Oh yeah, and a lot of people play that way. I think I've heard of that one before. I liked it because they allowed you more money, which is my favorite thing. Catch it's alto yeah exactly. Uh, we got ahead of ourselves. Let's just start at the real beginning. So everybody sits down at the table, maybe because somebody, yeah, somebody gets a drink. Maybe you have to wait because somebody has to go to the bathroom, So you're all sitting there quietly. And then when everybody's finally at the table, you guys select a banker, and the banker distributes the Monopoly money to each player to five hundreds, to fifties, six twenties, and five tens, five fives and five ones. That's hundred dollars. And the goal of the game that we're getting to here at thirty minutes in is to bankrupt all of your family and friends. That's the whole point pretty much. Um. Some people put a time limit because this game can go on forever um, and other people say, no, it's got a you gotta finish it by bankrupting everyone or until the last person. That's like, I give jeez, I've got eight dollars. I hate this game. Yeah. That's usually me and Emily is usually has her foot on my throat. Oh yeah, yeah, we played two person Monopoly, which is just not fun. Yeah, because you know one of you is gonna lose. No, that's not why. It's just it's a game that's more fun with more people. I think, Yeah, I got yeah. Um, so okay, so everybody's got fifteen bucks. You roll the dice to see who goes first. Whoever rules the highest goes first. Classic. Then you roll both die and you start moving from the ghost square and you go clockwise around the board. And when you land on a property. This I didn't know, which is kind of a basic rule, I guess, but I never played it this way. When you land on a property, you have the option to buy it. I knew that part. But if you decline to buy it, then the then the property goes up for ACKs. I've never not only have I never played it the way, I've never heard of anyone playing it. Okay, so it's not just me, not just you, all right, So uh I guess. Uh, the during an auction, not only the person, not only everybody else, but the banker and the person who declined to buy it can bid on it, which didn't make sense unless you're trying to get for lower because can't you start the bidding it wherever. Yes, you can start the bidding anywhere you want, so you could consumably get it for lower. And if you're playing against somebody who declines to buy something and then starts bidding on a lower price, keep an eye on that person that sharp to win. Yeah. Uh yeah, I hate that rule because to me, it's just like, what's the point and rolling and landing on something? I guess right at first refusal, But yeah, I don't know, I don't like it now. And plus the Quakers were like, we specifically put a price on these things so there wouldn't be a lot of yelling. Yeah, we don't like yelling. Uh. They had another game to follow called the quiet roof raising ceremony. Those are not Quakers, that was the Amist. They're different. Oh don't you think Quakers raise some roofs? Yeah, they ain't. No party like a Quaker party. All right. So let's say you buy all of the properties that you know they're they're divided into different colors, Like there's three green around you know, green ones, orange ones, blue ones, light blue. Um. If you buy all of the properties that are tied together by a single color, then you have what's called a monopoly, and that means you can then charge double rent, although we never do that. We just keep it single rent. And you now have the option to buy houses. And then once you have enough houses I think three, you can then buy a hotel and let's call improvements. You're improving your land. And once you start to do improvements, um, things change a little bit. Not only can you start making more money, but it's actually harder to mortgage your properties if you are if you find yourself in debt, right, because this is this is how crazy complicated it is. Like I don't think I was ever paying that much attention to monopoly that I ever mortgaged a piece of land. I think it's like started to get into debt or whatever. I was just like I'm done. Um, But apparently so if you find yourself indebted, and let's say you have a monopoly and um, you want to mortgage, you can mortgage just one of the spots, right, But to do so, let's say you have a hotel um on the that piece of land that you're mortgaging, you first have to sell the hotel back to the bank at half price, and then you can mortgage the land. You're still I think, are you collecting rent on that land? Or doesn't go right to the bank. Now that's where um, you just turn the card over and it's just you still technically own it, but you can't collect any rents on it. But you can't collect rent and everything on the other two pieces of property or the other one, depending on which one you own. I don't know, really you can't. I looked it up. So that doesn't bust up the monopoly, No, it doesn't Okay, so you still own the monopoly. It's just that that one is mortgaged, and then to get it back you have to pay the bank the mortgage plus ten percent. Right. And this is where you can get silly with your house rules if you want. Yeah, you know, like as far as mortgaging and stuff like that, because supposedly it's a rule to where you can't um. The only thing that is not allowed as a personal loan. And I did all kinds of personal loaning because I was Mr Cash. What were your your interest rates? I don't remember. Did you break any usury laws? No? That was a kid, so it was it was probably just like just pay me back whenever or something. I'm not the right I'm not enough of a you're not the start capitale. Now you're not the one who like declines to buy something so you can bid on at a lower price. I'm playing candy Land. I loved candy Land. Actually I never played that. It was a great game, was it because of the art? Crazy? It was beautiful off and then nowa daisy look at the candy landpoint and you're like, poor kids, Yeah, they don't know what they're missing. I just got a Ticket to Ride game that I haven't played yet. Have you heard of that one? It was a German game that's like one game of the year. It's a train train game, like you established train routes between cities. Um, but it's supposedly like it sounds like really that's fun, but it's supposedly great. I just bled it t here. Did you at the thought of it? Yeah, it does sound pretty bad, but no, it's it's it's one game in the year. Why those Germans and watch people Ticket to Ride enthusiasts will be like, dude, it's the best ever I've heard. Like, German game night is like a thing. Now, Yeah, I think they're a little more heavy. Is that what it is? I think? So this seems like I've read over the rules the other night just so I would know what to do. And because you've got to like the purchase over the game has to be the game explainer as well. You have to listen to craftword while you play. Yeah, well you don't have to, but it helps house rules. Yeah, so oh um, I guess we oh and we said you you can do anything but give personal loans, right, that's what the official rules state. So, like you can I can buy from you on the side or something like that, or you can hold something up for auction, whatever anybody's doing. Yeah, and we always played where you had to do that when it was your turn, and that that would take your turn as well. Yeah. Um, but again, the whole point is is to be the person who owns the most stuff so that you can bankrupt all of your family and friends. And I mean, those are the rules, but there's actually strategy to it, and people pay a lot of attention to this. You know, there's a Monopoly World Championship ropeally every four years, although it's been the last one in two thousand nine, so we're due an American lawyer one, right, and no, I think it was a Swede or maybe he was the North American. That's what he was, the North American champion and he represented the US and the world. Chan it shifts. It sounds so silly. Yeah, well he uh he used the iron. Yeah, I think the American used the thimble. That's a that's the fact that people need. Well, we're trying to really appeal to the purists here too, which at everybody to be engaged. Okay, chucker, So again, the point bankrupt. Everybody bankrupt. But there's like techniques that you can use to more efficiently bankrupt people, like the the overall the best strategy. The basic strategy is to buy everything every chance you have. Yeah, I mean I've looked up. There's a lot of different people's uh strategies and opinions online. Um. I did find this one from a guy and that was his strategy is by everything, it doesn't matter what it is, even the suckers bet the electric company and the water works, Yeah, which I don't pay off. Really, he said, buy it all and and never have more than a hundred dollars in cash is his rule. He says the number one people must mistake people make is hoarding cash like I did. Yeah, you're making the number one mistake, that's right. Uh. And he says that, um, buy everything and do whatever it takes to get a monopoly, even a bad one, like he will trade to get a bad monopoly and give someone a good monopoly, even as long as he gets the monopoly. And he says it's fine because then you know, you two will probably take out everyone else. Uh. The point is just to get a monopoly and improve it as fast as you can so supposedly though, Um, a general rule of film among like hardcore monopoly players is that while you're improving your monopoly your properties by adding houses or whatever, you want to stop at three houses because the jump from the third house to the hotel is financially it doesn't pay off. Usually it's over improvement. Yeah, just like in your home, like, don't build that eighty thousand dollar kitchen because you're not gonna get your money back on that, right, So three three houses. This guy doesn't subscribe to that. He buys everything and puts hotels on it. Yeah, he says, as first as he get as soon as he gets his first monopoly, he mortgages everything else to get cash back and then uses that cash to improve, which I thought was a little risky. Yeah, a couple of bad roles. I mean, it's a game of strategy, but the end of the day, you're rolling dice, and so it is very much a game of chance. I'll bet that guy feels like he's on the back of a pegasus though the whole game, Like he's just thrilled. He claims. He claims to have won a game in twelve minutes one time, which I thought was shooting his own horn a bit. Yeah sure, Um, but real regular strategy. You're right, they say three houses is the max you should go. Um, and then there's also some that you should avoid. Even though this seemed like very tempting, we already said the electric company and the water company, the utilities. The the most you can get for rent from landing on it was ten times a roll of the dice, which is a hundred and twenty bucks. It could be as low as twenty dollars. So I mean, this guy would probably say, well, hey, it was worth it, Like I still own them and I'm still making money if somebody lands on them. But a lot of Again, the monopoly pierists say just stay away from him. And you also may want to stay away from the most expensive ones boardwalk in park Place. Yeah they're they're only two of them, and um, they just don't get landed on very much. Yeah, so think about it right out of the gate when you're thinking of probabilities. Um, the fact that there's two of these properties rather than three means that you are that another player is less likely to land on your monopoly because there's three or two instead of three. So that's one problem. The other problem is placement where they are. They're right after um go right for right before. Yeah, so it's at the end of the board essentially. No, I'm sorry, they're right before jail. No, they're right before, they're right before go. Okay. So that means that most most players are going to well, they're going to pass them for sure whenever they hit that um go directly to go exactly yeah. Um. So that means that your your monopoly is going to be passed over. The likelihood of making your money back recouping it, especially if they're improved to the hilt, like a really fancy hotel, means that a lot of money. Yeah, you you've probably sunk a lot of money unwisely into those You want to go for some other ones, Yeah, supposedly, and there are people that have done Uh. There was this one guy. If you really want to get into monopoly, this dude, I don't even know his name, but just look up probabilities in the game of Monopoly and Scientific American in the mid nineties at the article that talked about probabilities of landing on different spaces, but they excluded um community chest and chance and being sent to jail. So this guy said, I took all of that and included everything, and he has a statistical charts long term probabilities for ending up on each square, expected income per opponent role, average income per role, expected number of opponent role, to recoup incremental costs UH, to recoup mortgages. So it's the name of his website. By the way, his monopoly was fun dot com. It totally should be um, but um. If you just want to do some basic probabilities, the orange properties are landed on more than anyone else. Yes, and why chuck because they are after jail. Yeah, six eight and nine spaces after jail. Yeah. So if you get sent to jail, which is going to happen at some point and we actually we didn't talk about jail, we'll talk about that, then you, uh, yeah, chances are you're gonna hit one of those orange squares on your way out of jail. Yeah, because you're rolling with two dice, so you're much more likely to roll like a six, s eight or a nine then you are like a two or three or a one. Yeah. It's not even possible to roll at one. Try it. You can't. You can't unless you eat one of the dice, and in which case, unless it's a house rule, everybody's gonna yell at you and have to wait around until you poop it out to keep playing. Actually, our rule was you had to roll the child in what the child you ate the dice? Oh yeah, all right, So jail um is in the corner of the board, and you can there are a few different ways you can go there. You can draw a go to jail card. You can throw three doubles in a row and go to jail. Yeah, which I never understood because that's a good thing, I guess, but it's also the sign of the devil. So that's why you have to go to jail for a little while to be cleansed. Or there is a square march to go to jail, and you can land on that and go to jail. You can also get out in three ways. You can have that get out of Jail free card. If you draw that, you can hold onto it. We could sell it, although I think that's a house rule. You can sell it to a friend or enemy, uh, whoever, whoever had the most cast right exactly. Uh. And then you basically the other ways to roll to either pay your way out for with fifty bucks or to roll your way out. The way we played it was each turn you had one chance to roll your way out of jail. So you rolling doubles right, um, and then if you under official rules, if you don't roll doubles for three consecutive turns, like you get three consecutive chances to roll doubles, and if you don't on any of those turns, then you have to pay fifty bucks to get out of jail. We just played where you just got out and you didn't have to pay. Well, then you guys weren't following the rules. I told you the house rules us. So there's actually a strategy to jail. Um, if you go to jail early on in the game, you want to pay your fifty bucks to get out immediately, just pay the fifty bucks because then you can keep going around the board and there's more stuff lable to buy. But later in the game you want to just kind of hang out in jail. Yeah, Like Josh has bought all the orange spaces and you've got hotels on each one, so I'm thinking that might be good to sit in jail for a few rounds. Yeah, because you can still collect rent on your properties, but the fact that you're in jail keeps you off of my properties. Yeah, and all another Bryant rule we played where when you were in jail you could not collect any rents. Yeah, I mean that makes sense, but according to official rules, you just make as much money as you want there, and apparently in jail you can officially you can also buy and sell properties and improve your in collect rent, and build hotels and houses, which I thought, I don't know, if you're in jail, kind of lose that right. It seems like in real jail that's the way it is. No, it's not. You can own a house and be in jail. I guess that's true, and technically you could probably charge rent to someone. You could sub let it, like I'm gonna be gone for three to six. No, it's true. But what happens when dis roster breaks trying to get let out of jail to go fix it. They're not gonna let you do that. It's very funny, but it's true too. Uh. Probability experts also say you get a good return on buying all the railroads because they're pretty cheap. There's one on each side, and once you have each once you own all of them. Um, they're two hundred dollars in rent, so that's not too bad, not too shabby, but to me, and monopoly is the reason monopolies are valuable. But it is because they're in a row, whereas the railroads are spaced out. And our friend, the strategist who thinks he uh invented the game says, but what you have to remember is none of these strategies matter because you're playing. It's a game of people and personalities. So he said, you gotta sit back and watch the different personalities emerge and then you manipulate that like the cash hoarder versus the shark. And uh, he's like, you really playing against people. Man, that's interesting, I thought. So okay, so let's talk about another friend, an economist friend. His name is Ralph Ant Spock. Yes, and he back in the seventies had a game called anti Monopoly. Yeah. He was an econ professor at San Francisco States and um, like made his own real game. Like he didn't just like draw it up on paper, like, he started a little small business and manufactured it. Apparently sold about two thousand copies of it, like, right, out of the gate, like it just hit a nerve. Again. It's called anti monopoly, and the whole point of it was to break up monopolies rather than build monopolies. Yeah. At the beginning of the game is essentially the end of a regular game, like everyone starts off with monopolies. Uh. And instead of real estate and utilities, um and anti monopoly, they had their individual busins. This is that had been brought under a single ownership, and you take the role of federal caseworker and bring indictments against monopolized businesses. In order to turn return the board to a free market system. You have to wear sensible shoes. It sounds awesome. Yeah. Well, and he came up with this because he was trying to apparently explain to his son what was wrong and bad about monopolies and I suspect capitalism to a certain extent, and he came up with this game instead, Like I said, sold a substantial amount two copies of the game, especially back in the seventies, that was pretty good as a startup. Yeah, you know, and it caught Parker brothers attention enough that they sent him a cease and desist letter, took him to court, got a court order for him to hand over his like thirty seven thousand copies that he had in his warehouse, and um they Parker Brothers went and unceremoniously buried him in a landfill in Minnesota. So, UM, Ralph didn't cott into this very much. He didn't like that. He doesn't like to be pushed around. I get the impression. No, I mean, a guy who makes anti monopoly is not gonna cave in the courts initially, and he did so, like very much, at his own financial detriment. He had a very expensive team of lawyers at first, UM and spent quite a bit of money fighting Parker Brothers for the right to use anti Monopoly, and UM what, it wasn't really going anywhere and he was losing a lot of money. So he started to do legwork himself, found a lawyer friend UM who worked on the cheap for him, and that's when things started taking off. Yeah, I mean, he basically uncovered the lie that it was invented by Charles Darrow. He found out that the game was essentially in the public domain, or should have been, and UM went all the way to the Supreme Court. One. Yeah, he won at the Supreme Court, this acount professor came up with a game called Anti Monopoly. One in the Supreme Court won the right to name his game anti Monopoly. Yeah, I mean he he deposed the the two Quakers that were friends of Hoskins. They were old at that point. They took the stand. Um. He deposed the CEO of Parker Brothers, and he took the stand and it had to admit under oath like, yeah, we did kind of steal it nice the idea from that lady Um after all. And so, as Ralph says, the the whole point to him was for this true story, the true origins of monopoly and how it came about, the whole point of it originally could still be told openly that what he said, um couldn't be bought at any price in his opinion, that's right, So way to go, Ralph. Yeah, he wrote a book, uh awkwardly titled the Billion Dollar Monopoly in swindle Colin during David and Goliath battle. Anti Monopoly uncovers the secret history of Monopoly. That's a little clunky, little clunky, but it's still around. Um In. There was a new version called Anti Monopoly too, where you could actually be a monopolist or a competitor. So you got to choose, which I thought was interesting. And Uh, if you chose the competitor, you charge lower rents and you can improve property at anytime. But if you're a monopolist, you have to own at least two properties before in a group, before building houses, in charge a lot higher rents. So I think you're like playing against the two systems within the same game. That's really interesting. Yeah, I'm gonna I might grab one of these and see what it's like. Maybe tell everybody's German. Uh, you got anything else? I got nothing else. I do the longest Monopoly game of all time seventy days. I played a game of risk that seemed like it lasted that long once. It may have. It didn't last long, but lasted a weekend. Okay, um, and Monopoly. I don't have the patience for that. I'll just give up. I'll take my cafit cash and go home your horde of it. Yeah, you're like, oh, that's saved all this money. That's right, and I own the utilities. Uh. If you want to learn more about Monopoly, including how to play, if you don't like house rules, but you also don't feel like looking at the official rule book, you can just go on the how Stuff works and check out the rules that is in this article to site monopoly in the search bar at house to works dot com. And since as I searched bar, it's time for chuck Facebook questions. Uh so, people, this is what we do sometimes when we don't have a listener mail prepared, we will go on Facebook asked for questions, and then over the course of a couple of episodes, we will read those out in rapid fire like fashion. We don't do anything in rapid fire fast. I couldn't even explain rapid fire fashion and rapid fire. All right, So I'm gonna start this off with Louise Benjamin says, with as many shows as he recorded, how many would you like to go back and redo? Um, just a small handful. I would say that. I was literally kind of like, I'm really disappointed with that. Yeah, you're a little harder honest than I am. Though. What's weird is like any time I do say like that was terrible, You're like, yeah, it wasn't bad, and I'll go back and listen to I'll be like it was way better than I thought. That's what Jerry says when you leave the room. She says, they're always better than anything's. Oh really, I didn't realize Jerry talked about me when I wasn't here or spoke at all when I was in she was not allowed. Alright, you got one, I do. Um. Let's see, do either of us have a preference as to what type of vacuum cleaner you use? That's from Taylor Jean Warner with the most pedestrian question anyone's ever asked.

Uh you mean. And I have a Dyson one of the little, not the big one. Yeah, one of the smaller ones. Yeah, with the yellow ball. Uh just a regular upright back. Yeah yeah. I got on the canister thing years ago. I love him. I don't know why this thing took Like you know, they they're like, you never loses suction, it's very powerful or whatever. I accidentally rolled over the cord to charge my phone. It sucked the rubber off of the cord. Yeah, I had to put electrical TakeBack on. It does suck. All right, that's some buzz marketing. Joseph Campbell, what is your advice on how to have a successful marriage? Joseph Campbell asked us a question. Yeah, wow, you should know this question. Her answer, Uh, Mary, Mary, your friend.

Really, Yeah, you do. As a kid, I was Justice League. I was way more into that. But here's an adult like that Avengers movie is great. I'm into that. Justice League is DC. Yeah, Superman definitely, Batman. Yeah, although I like the the super Friends. That was all Justice League, wasn't it. Uh? Yeah, okay, well I have a coherent answer, then okay for live action animation, not live action, but for animation, I prefer Justice League. For comic books, I preferred um Avengers Marvel. Well in the new movie. Uh, they're doing the Superman Batman movie and then a full on Justice League movie is just leading up to that. So we'll see jury's out.

What was they called The Great Christmas Kidnapping Caper? And it wasn't like a little kid's book. I mean, that was my first novel. It was long, long form. That was your favorite book when you're a kid. Yep. My favorite book when I was a little kid was a Christmas book. I think it was a golden book called something like a Visit to Santa's Workshop or something. Yeah, it was so cute. And then, uh, strangely, the first series of novels that I ever loved were Ramona Quimby books. Oh really, man, I used to eat those up and I would take flak too at school.
