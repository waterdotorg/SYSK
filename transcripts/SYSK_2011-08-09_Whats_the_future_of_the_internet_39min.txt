Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff You Should Know? From House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant. Welcome to the Future of the Internet. It's called Stuff you Should Know. We have the past, the present, in the future of my friend choke on that haters. Yeah, so that's what we're talking about today, and I'm hoping you have some awesome cool story about, you know, the future or the Internet. You'd think I would no intro on this one. No, there's a surprising um dearth of stuff out there about the future of the Internet. I found that a lot of people are really really nervous about putting their neck out because we finally reached a point in time where you can build a career based on successfully and accurately predicting the next move right, So everybody is kind of confident about what's coming five years from now, seven years from now, and if we haven't by the time this thing comes out, uh put it on the actual name of this episode. I'm going to go ahead and put what is the future of the Internet parentheses seven years from now, because that's really what it's about, unless you want to start talking trans humanism, chuck, which I'm prepared to I like trans humanism, not on this one though, Okay, but um, if you unless you're prepared to talk about that. It's basically like, what's it going to be like seven years from now? And there's some pretty good guesses. Uh. And one of the people who's not too shabby at guessing is um one of our coworkers colleagues. His name is John Strickland, and if you don't follow him on Twitter, you're missing out strick of tex stuff. Yeah, his Twitter handles John Strickland, j o in Strickland obviously one word, no other anything in between. Well, Josh and LOUI of an interesting story from you that is the opposite is supportive? No, no, no, we should totally support him. I always do. I love straight even though there's a fake Internet battle between us that fans like to think exists, I know it's. Uh in lieu of a great story, then how about I have a few stats on just the Internet as it is and as it was, then we can talk about what it might be. How does that sound. Um, here's a nice infographic. These all come from the Pew Research Institute Research Center for People in the Press specifically, that's US Pew the press. Are we yeah, technically good journalists? Internet adoption. This is just a little infographic. In June, about four of American adults eighteen and over adopted an internet used the Internet. Isn't that crazy? What year is that sounds right? Not nineteen twelve, not that long ago? No, but yeah, I remember that was back in the day of like Prodigy, and they'd have answer prodgy. You'd still be like what the Prodigy? Yeah? Yeah, what was prodigy? An like it was a it was a web server? Was browsing I P or yes? No service provider? Yes? Uh? November oh one. So between June and November one and went from fourteen percent to sixty percent, and today we stand at about seventy seven percent. That's staggering to me. Sent Yeah, it's not higher. Seventy eight percenter, men seventy six percent or women pretty evenly divided. Uh, if you want to go to household income is interesting to the hundred and fifty percent is split pretty much even. No, no, no, seventy eight percent of men using it and of women, so just two percent more of men for some reason, um household income. Think of the reason. If you make seventy five grand or more a year, you have a nine chance that you use the internet. And I guess the other four percent are old people that don't understand it. They're filthy rich. They pick up the keyboard and try to talking to It's uh less than thirty thou dollars per year. Surprisingly, still use the internet on a daily basis. Well, this is why they call it ubiquitous. It is ubiquitous. And then finally, Josh, I'm going to finish up with what people do on the internet. What American adults do on the internet on an average day, Um, send or read email? And then I found period like eight five percent use email. So people don't check their email on a daily basis. That's nuts. Those are what they call the relaxed. People use a search engine to find information, get their news, go online just for fun. Is that the category? Yeah, thirty seven percent use some sort of social networking site. Um, yeah that was November. That's probably even higher right now. Check the weather bank online every day, watch the YouTube or a video sharing site. And about of people look for news and politics political information every day. So just interesting. That's what's that is the current state of the Internet. I think I do all of that except um, news or not news, weather, little commerce, little news, shopping, communication, social networking. It's all pretty basic it when you think about it, compared to it's not basic. Um. But yeah, well that's the whole point of the Internet. It's there to serve us, right, that's right, Like it's supposedly all of our needs right there. And what we're seeing right now is a movement toward making accessibility easier and easier. Very true. So um, one of the ways to make accessing the Internet easier and easier, Chuck, is to um increase download speeds or what's called the effective data data transfer rate. And also, I think we should put disclaim right here. If you've ever wanted to chew me and chuck up alive for missing something, for screwing up something, for getting something just totally wrong, here's here's your chance. Um, if you if you couldn't get us on the Sun podcast or the Epigenetics podcast, here's your chance. So let us know you can be nice about it. You don't have to be a jerk, but you can definitely correct us because we're open to that kind of thing. So the effective data transfer rate, right, that's the the the average rate at which x number of bits um transfers from one place to another, uh in some block of time. How fast you're junk runs? You know, that's what we're talking about. When I click on this thing, how fast is it gonna load this movie? Right? And that's funny because movies are pretty much the go to standard of how fast something goes? Right. So um Strickling wrote this, and one of his first prediction for the future of the Internet is that it's speed speeds are going to be increased tremendously. I really went out a lender, but that's what I'm saying. Like, if you go and look, if you do a search for future of the Internet, you're not gonna find anything different than this. It's crazy, like, no one's no one's sticking their neck out at all. No one knows but he but he said that. According to Akamai Technologies, which puts out a State of the Internet report on a quarterly basis, the average global data transmission speed late two thousand nine, which might as well was one point seven megabits per second megabytes. I can find the current one. I couldn't either. One reason why is because if you look up stuff like this, all you're gonna find is a T and D says it's this fast, Verizon says you can get it this fast. And it's people advertising how fast they can do it right or average. It's some obscure website about you know, like what what a four G network should be for Um, somebody broke a record, and in fact there's a record um that he mentions from Bell Labs right from this is the current record as far as I know. Yes, it could have been from yesterday and now it's outdated. Uh, this one, this one is pretty recent. Um. I believe it was May maybe I'm not sure, but it was a hundred petabytes. Okay, what's a pot a petabyte, chuck, is a million gigabytes. So that's a hundred million gigabytes in a second that they transferred, or a hundred billion megabits Okay, let's just another way to say it. Or I guess a trillion bits right better? Math is wrong. So the and then of course that's that's in a second. So they managed to transfer, um a hundred million gigabytes of information in a second. And what does that mean in DVDs, which are like the big max of the internet. Right, Well, um, it turns out that they transferred twenty two million DVDs worth of information in a second. Right now, this is using a laser. Well yeah, and I need to point out I did go to the Acamite technology site which publishes this quarterly report, and it sat there as a PDF, and I was like, oh great, Q four or Q one. I was like, perfect, click. You must be a member to access this information. So the point is, though, is not that we know the average transfer rate worldwide. The point is is what we're getting and what is potentially possible. Uh is there's a huge gap there between what you can get commercially, right and while that while that transfer of a hundred peta bytes was across a laser, which no one's using right now in a commercial network not yeah yeah, Um, there's the record for fiber optic, which is in wide use, that's your broadband. Um it was twenty six terabytes, which is um, I think a thousand gigabytes. That's fast. Yeah, So twenty six thousand gigabytes in a second. So that's still a broadband, huge gap between what is available to us. So the whole point of this is is this is where we can potentially end up. Is you can download a movie to watch an HD movie in a second, right just by clicking on it. What makes me said is that we're not already at like a petabyte of information transferred already. I wonder what all the reasons I don't like on our local area network here at the office, it says like hundred megabytes a second. It's like, no, it's like, that's what I could be getting, but it's never what you get, and I just think it's it's the Internet's fast, but it could be faster. Agreed. That's point one, all right, And the prediction is it probably will be wirelessly and landline base and wireless is going to get faster and faster, and that's probably where people are going to start putting most of their money if they're not already in figuring out ways to make it faster and faster, because wireless is what everybody wants, right. Um, If the Internet is found in devices, if that's the future of it and how it's consumed, then wireless is probably the basis of most of these devices. And not only that, Chuck, Not only do consumers want it, but companies Internet service providers want wireless to be the next Internet as well, because that SEC ruling from December of two thousand ten on net neutrality basically said, yes, the Net needs to remain neutral unless it's wireless, and they left the door open for wireless Internet service providers to show favoritism. And this is the second part of the John Strickland prediction extravaganza of the future of the Internet. Where the Net's going to be going. That's right. Net neutrality, Josh, is a big can of worms of which we could do an entire podcast, but we're gonna only pull one worm from this and simply say, if you've heard the term net neutrality, you don't know what it is. Basically, it is keeping the Internet wide open. No matter which I s P you're using, you can access the same content as someone else using another I s P. The potential against this would be, uh if an I s P, let's say, cuts a deal with certain vendors with the site a website, Yeah, certain websites doesn't have to be a vendor, but it could be then they're gonna put their juice, their best juice into making that really fast fast load. Right, you would get your hundred megabytes a second download for that website, but maybe the other website, which may be the competition of that other website, it's gonna make it really slow or just not make it be available at all. And like a cable company, you can't get our beloved science channel, which is wrong. Yes, uh, because you know certain cable companies they got a monopoly in your area and you're like, oh, I can only go with um blank cable company in my area, and they don't carry these channels or they don't carry the websites. That's the future, um And And that's a big problem because the Internet was the model of it was kind of based on all the mistakes that have been made in the past, learning from that and then now once we realize what we have at our hands, it became less neutral in December two thousand ten, um And it's a big, big deal. Yeah, it really is. You We've seen with the Arab Spring how touchy people get when um you shut down their access to the Internet. Revolutions occur, right, So centering the Internet in any way, shape or form is um is a definite no no. But the problem with this FCC ruling is that it allows for basically um financial censorship of the Internet. And one of the problems with this, this lack of net neutrality is if you get what you pay for, then the Internet will become divided across class lines. Yeah, the biggest websites that can afford fastest download times and speeds will weed out the mom and pop quote unquote of the Internet. Right, and then just based on the the basic capitalist theory, those websites aren't just gonna hang out over here and hope that, you know, the net expands once again. They're gonna weather on the vine and die, and we're going to have a paired down, leaner, probably more corporates version of the Internet exactly. And what I think should happen, Josh, and I think a lot of people agree, is to let it be a little more Darwinian, which is what it has been, which is keep it an even playing field and just see who survives. And if you if you remember when all the startups the big boom in the nineties, when I mean there were so many new commerce sites and I remember thinking at the time. You know the Amazons will survive and all the other ones are a lot of the other ones will die off, But you think is going to make it. I had a director I worked that bought a lot of stock in the web band. Yeah, I have a friend who did that didn't work out so well. And I'm not laughing. It's not funny. I feel very bad for people who put a lot of money into a start of field. But that's my point is it was. It was a level playing ground. At least, it's whoever does it the best will win out. And the Amazon's one out, the YouTube's one out. Did you did you put your money where your mouth was? And like invest in the Yahoo's Dude, do you think I had any money in? You can't have any money in two thousand eleven. If you had money in ninety five, you would have it in two thousand eleven. I imagine unless you hung onto that Yahoo stuck. UM. One of the ways that that net neutrality, I guess is threatened is is UM a lot of companies that make devices UM weren't waiting around to see what how the FCC ultimately ruled or whether the net would remain neutral. They started making what are called walled gardens. Right, So the devices, I should say, by the way, they're called tethered appliances. What are we talking about. It's an iPhone and droid smartphone. But let's let me Apples is such a great example of this. I'm gonna pick on Apple, but it's not just Apple doing this. Like, um, the Xbox Xbox Live. You can't access Xbox Live through any other other device than the Xbox. That makes the Xbox the tethered appliance. You have to have that to do that. Okay, So um, with the with the iPad or the iPhone, it's a that's a tethered appliance. Um, you use that to access what's called a walled garden. Right. The the it does the iPhone, it's supposed to be. It's a very nice, pleasant, like um, user friendly, very design heavy corner of the Internet. It's part of the Internet, but you can't get to it through traditional means. You have to get to it through this device that you buy from this company, and they own this section of the Internet. The iPhone app Store is a part of the Internet that Apple owns that you can't get to any other way. So there's this one way to get in there. And as uh say, you know you can't get to the iPhone app store to your droid, right, so you can, you can. But let's say, let's say the market share for handheld mobile devices um went to Apple and droid head ten percent. But you can't survive with ten percent, and eventually it's going to be Apple that creates the user experience of the Internet. That ubiquitous design. I'm sorry to use that word twice, but that that design that's just so emblematic of Apple, that is so many people's experience of the Internet. Yet you're experiencing the Internet through Apple's exactly nice, chuck. But the Android has completely different design. It's a completely different experience. And if you ever put an Android user in an iPhone user into the same room, they are barely talking about the same thing. Yeah, even though what they're talking about our handheld devices that access the Internet supposedly the same Internet. And then all right, think about this. You've got, um, let's say, a less popular handheld device these days, like the Carnival, like the palm, Let's say the Carnival, the Carnival. A people are are designing apps for the droid, and the companies are designing apps for the droid and the and the iPhone like crazy because those are the two biggest ones and they want to get it all over the place. You feel maybe bad for other handheld devices that don't have people saying, oh, man, I want to design a CARNIVALI app so CARNIVALI users can have that same rich experience. CARNIVALI doesn't have the money. I mean, I'm sure they're trying to get in that marketplace and design their own cool apps. But the apps are coming from the apps are coming from how stuff works dot com and what we do apps for. We did apps for the droid and for the iPhone. So far, we haven't done a car Carnival. We have not done one. And poor Carnivale is gonna suffer one day because essentially they're being left in the dust. And the Internet experience is being lived through two handheld devices and eventually there could possibly be one or you know, or it could expand in the BlackBerry or I'm sorry, the the uh, the Strawberry could catch up and and revolutionize things and get way more apps than the iPhone. Who knows, but itself follows that same model. I mean, ask Adobe. They make flash and everybody loves flash. A revolutionized how we how we consume material on the internet. Right. The Apple chose not to operate flash on its OS, and it's mobile OS. So any site that has flash, you just have that little cube, the little Rubric's cube, and that's it. In Apple is not the least bit apologetic of it. And the crazy thing is is Apple users aren't demanding flash. Flash is just going the way of the dinosaur because Apple chose not to support it. And now everybody's like, there's a whole HTML five developer movements out there where this is the next thing that's going to replace flash, right because Apple chose not to support flash, Right, how's it? That's that's the That's the Internet being carved down by people who, um are making decisions for everybody else. How are we doing on this? We could? I think we're okay. I think one of the ways we're getting away with this in large part is that we are this is opinion well, and I know I feel like I'm in a in a lake with like the waters just under my nose because dealing with this text stuff is such Strickland's line of work and he feels so comfortable with it, and uh, I just have And with Techy's especially, it's not like we're talking about you know, bear spray and like five people know that we're in over our heads. Techy's really pay attention and there to be like these guys are so wrong. I know, I know, and again if we are, if we are wrong, please do correct started discussion. We like that. Yeah, um, but Chuck, I feel like I'm bleeding from under my fingernails from just hanging on. That's two. Number two is that the Internet will be a leaner, slicker, more corporateised version of itself. Now perhaps possibly there's a book I read across. I haven't read it. I just came across it today. Um, it's by a guy named Jonathan ZiT Train z I T t R A I n uh. It's called The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It. That's where I got the tethered Appliances thing. And he's basically like, we need more like user generated stuff and less walled gardens. And if we don't have them, if we don't do something now, then when it's we're toast because there's so much cash to be made out there on the Internet, that it's gonna be a big fight either way, even if there is success in creating um a more democratic internet, right or maintaining it. I guess. So that's some of the tech stuff. What's the third one? Oh, yeah, we know this one. Yeah, Nicholas Carr, We've talked about this. Uh. This guy wrote a book, I'm sorry, an article called his Google making a Stupid that got a lot of press. We used it in presentations, we've used it in podcasts, and the hypothesis is that the way you navigate and read things on the Internet is not like book learning. In book reading, it's not deep vertical absorption. It's horizontal and it's spotty or right bapid absorption. And it's basically his argument that just because we have this library of information doesn't mean that we're using it to make a smarter Well, he was saying that it's it's so revolutionized how we learned by the access we have the information that it's changing our brains were being cognitively restructured. I believe that to a certain degree. Oh I do too, man. My attention has decreased spectacularly over the last four years. Since I've worked here well, and then I did Stuff from the Future podcast this week. It's one over us. It is out awesome. Tell them everybody about it, real quick. Stuff from the Future. It's a podcast where someone just muses on something for about five minutes on what it might be like. Mine was personal communication, and my point that I was making is that people are not communicating the same way since the advent of the smartphone. They're not even talking on the phone as much because the texting. Uh, they're not talking face to face. And what does that mean a hundred years down the road? Are people gonna be freaked out having when someone drops by their house and knocks on the door, or when someone I'm already close to that point, or when somebody has a personal eye to eye confrontation with you. I'm right there, buddy, I'm the future. You're looking at it. So I argue that all you see nowadays, or the tops of people's heads instead of eyes, all you see is people looking down all the time everywhere, and that we're not flexing. We can't remember anything. We don't have the opportunity to remember something we used to know and flexing those deep memory muscles because you can hardly get the word out who was that someone before someone has looked it up and told you who it was. So there's no more tip of the tongue experiences, there's no more deep memory. But we're flexing different parts of our brain, like how to use my thumbs to type, so I think, but it's making us stupider. So that's your that's I mean, it's certainly changing things, and I don't know if it's for the better. I mean, we have immediacy of information. But the way Strickland took it was that car was saying, like we're taking our um need to keep this information. And I know he made this point in this article, but like we had to to to to know the right answer to something before we had to know it, and now we don't have to know it because we have a repository that anybody can access through their phone now to go get the answer. So it's like a giant collective brain that we're coming to rely on, exactly. But what happens when that brain malfunctions or that brain is being fed certain information that's false, that's false, or that's you know. I'm not saying it's gonna be like but dumbed down if it net neutrality, if the government gets more involved and all of a sudden, I mean, look at what's already going on in China. They're being fed specific information and that could one day be our truth in reality. Man, that was dystopian. Yeah, with my my um concern about it, it's kind of closer to yours. But it's more that, like my brain is literally being restructured physically through plasticity, that instead of being able to absorb something deeply, I'm getting the bits of information I need out of something very quickly. And then you know, when that brings up another question, I just opened a new tab swarch for that question. Start putting stuff together, so I'm able to connect seemingly disparate ideas into a third hybrid idea. But at the same time, I'm not necessarily getting it that you know, when something clicks, it's things don't click anymore, But though those are such beautiful moments when they do click, the tip of the tongue moments when you finally think that thing, it's such a rewarding experience. And that's going away to a large degree. Yeah, when things just clicking, when you know it is that what you mean, that's not what you're saying. Is it clicking? You know? What I'm saying is like the tip of the tongue moment, like when you can't think of something like oh, what was it? What was it? And when you finally think of it two hours later, it's so great. But that can't happen anymore because I'm dummy, won't even give you the chance to think of it. It's just here. It was the Jackie Chan We actually at Max foncan at um Uh the after party in Hodgeman's room. He was about twelve folks hanging out and he'd said, this is a Google free evening. He said, no one touch your phone, leave in your pocket. And we spent three hours talking and many things came up that people were like, oh, what was that? What was that? And it was it was like no one like it was like the old days six years ago when you would have these awesome conversations and not be able to think of something and be like, oh man, And then the next day you would see one of those people and say, dude, I thought of what that was? And uh, I don't know. I think the smartphones are ruining things in a lot of ways. Yeah, there's a lot of problems they're not connecting people like they're kind of putting up walls in a lot of ways as they also connect. It's a conundrum. I read something once. I think we should end on this. UM. There's a rule of thumb out there that if it's basically ETIQUETTEUM, when you can use your phone in a social situation where I feel like, if you follow it, you can still be a normal person. But if you wouldn't, if you wouldn't pull out a crossword puzzle and start doing it in the social situation, you shouldn't pull out your fun right, It's pretty much the same thing. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, Yeah, I'm gonna just go over a few of these. UM. Sarah Kessler at Mashable road. Oh, yeah, these are a cool thing. UM. Six web pioneers on what the Internet of the future will look like. Chuck found five satisfactory, and so we'll this briefly go over a couple of these. UM. Verry Glick, founder of map Quest, you know the glixter. He says, uh, kind of what we were talking about earlier. He said, right now, the internet has been very computer oriented and that's the association. You need a computer to connect. He said, that's going away of course already. But basically he sees the future of there being no boundaries. The Internet is just this invisible present power supply, and all you will have is uh access devices. There will be no more television, there will be no more telephone. You'll just have these devices, everything crammed into one that tap into the brain of the earth. Interesting, you came up with the brain of the earth thing, right, do you want to read? Uh? Yeah, I liked UM. Jeremy Stoppelman, who is the CEO of Yelp, and he talked about augmented augmented reality, which kind of UM dovetails with his business because of his applications. Well, there's an app for Atlanta I read about recently where it's like you hold up your phone, this Matt feature UM pops up like augmented reality on all the stuff that's showing up on your phone of the area around you, Like here's this restaurant special today, or um, this is a great place to go dancing if that's your kind of thing. But I don't think the augmented reality says that part. But it's UM. I mean, it's already here. That's that's I think extremely interesting to me that it's like this. Do you remember those um, the human body and like the little celluloid. Yeah, you could peel back right and it was like the skin and then you peel back the skin and there's like all the muscles. You peel that back, there's the organs and the nerves and all that. It's kind of like laying one of those over real life. I just it's really cool. I think if you peel back the final one of those books that just should have your face like the right around the abdomen, but it but it's dead. It's like rotting. U that's horrifying. Actually, Ryan osamec president of Open Source Matter, sees more and more focused on the cloud. Yeah, well yeah, I yeah, obviously yeah. Um, I mean, like I said, these guys aren't exactly going out on a limb uh dries uh by a tart of the founder of Drupele thinks more websites within a single organization, more different devices that need to consume those websites with different experiences, and more social things. So basically more of what's going on is what he thinks exactly more of the same. Interesting. So I guess I want to say if anybody wants to uh to tell us what we got wrong, that's fine, or speculate on what you think. Ye, we'd love to hear you stick your neck out, so send us an email. We'll give you the email address when we're finished. But if you want to learn more about the future of the Internet, uh, type in future Internet in the search bar, how stuff works dot com and that brings up what chuck uh Facebook as Josh and Chuck feature. Let me call us something different every time? All right, we did this that these are running concurrently on the previous show where we post on Facebook. Ask us whatever. We'll buzz through as many as we can. Some are funny, some are serious, and we will treat them bestlie, We'll treat them all funny. H Alex Embre You do you guys prepare what you say together or by yourselves before your record? Alex, We've answered this before, but for new listeners, we do not prepare. We do not go over stuff. We try to just prepare separately and have a conversation. Yeah, and record it pretty simple, That is it. That's the mojo. Um I got one have we ever met Jad and Robert from Radio Lab. I have not, but Robert Lamb of Stuff to Blow Your Mind has interviewed him one of the guys on the phone. Yeah, he's a big fan of this. Yeah, I am too a huge fan. Uh. What you gotta Chuck? Uh? What music are you listening to right now? Attending any concerts this summer? I'm hopefully going to attend here you, Louise, I'm listening to the new Bonnie Bear. It's good, new My Morning Jacket, New p J. Harvey Tyler the Creator. Have you heard this kid? No, it's your rapper.
