Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. And now for the exciting conclusion, it's s Y s K is Guatemalan Adventure. Here we find team Stuff you Should Know about to depart for their second school visit. So we take off from there and we go to our second school for our first Computer Center inauguration. And it's here, Chuck, that we ran into one of my favorite people, Mr Howard Lab. Dude, Howard Lab is one of the coolest, strangest dudes I've ever met in my life. I'm just gonna go ahead throw that out there, and he grows on you like real quick. Remember when we first met him at the hotel in Guatemala City. He came up and was shaking our hand and wearing a Fannie pack and talking real fast, and he was all smiles and he leaves in the three of us cynics were like, that guy's weird. Then we meet him again. Really, um, I think it was before this one we got to hang out with him, but by the time we interviewed him at this Computer Center inauguration, we hearted Howard, Yes, we hearted him very much and still do. Howard's a great guy, a stand up guy, as I call him in one of the interviews, that I don't think we're gonna use. So the computer program Josh works a lot like the textbook program. UM. But why should we talk about it when the truly weird and awesome Howard Lob can describe it for us? In large part, we typically work with larger schools and a textbook program. Uh, if the school has fifty to a hundred kids, you're good to go. It doesn't matter a number of kids so much. But in the computer center, UM, we typically look for schools that I have about two d kids or more. That way you cover all the costs and still keep that student contribution guns and you have partners as well. Right, that's right. All of our like Rotary Club, Mike Soft, UM, other foundations, et cetera help us with that seed donation, and Microsoft as well helps us with licenses. So that's an ongoing gift and kind UM. And that that kind of starts that jump starts the program, and then after that we look for the communities to really make it self sustaining. We don't expect donors to come back year after year to pay the electric bill, to pay the to provide new computers. No, the ideas it's kind of a prompt our promise to the donors that their money is well spent um in a in an effective way and that the community will take that ball and run with it. So so that's how it works in a nutshell. Um, much like the textbook, revolving funds self sustainable. But the kids paid just a little bit more money. Well, I think it's more frequent. I think where they paid two dollars a year for a textbook, they paid two bucks a month form a computer. How is that what it is? Yeah? And um, but you spread it over two hundred kids again in five years, you have that self sufficient s grow fund um that compared to replace all the computers. And the computers chuck were they were nice computers. But there was something really strange about them. Do you know what? It was? No Internet? No Internet. They had a simulated internet. Here's what the kids learn on these things they learn, these rural, poor Guatemalan children are learning Microsoft Office programs courtesy of Microsoft, one of their little partners, which is great. Yeah, I think he mentions them in one of the clips. Okay, they learn how to email, they learn in Carter, which is might seem a little old fashioned to us, but it's great for them, right and Windows movie Maker, and they have a simulated Internet, so when they eventually get out into the workforce and see the real Internet, they're not like, what is this? What's going on? But it will still be blown away. Yeah, I'm still blown away on a daily basis. Right. But one of the things that you were talking about that that blew you away was, Um, these kids are just encountering computers for the first time, and they were already making like power point slide shows and stuff like that. Right. And um Howard was telling us about, uh, some of the successes that have come from these computer centers. Uh that cooperative for education a k A. Co ed sponsors or sets up. Um and uh he was talking about these kids that made a T shirt company. Right, Yeah, let's hear that one. For example, in a town not far from here, this um group of girls broke into a group of four six students and they did a project that we call Microsoft or Project Off excuse me. And in this project they learned to create a business usually it's as simulated business. In this case, they made it a real business. And they decided that they were going to create T shirts UM to sell to UH, to sell to UH fellow classmates and things like that. So they use Microsoft Sell to create a budget, They used Microsoft PubL As Sure and MovieMaker to create advertising material and like a fake a mock tv ad UM, they worked with a local silk screening company and created T shirts and started selling them. And even though they graduated from middle school, they still got this thing going. So so you've got kids going from middle school and actually generating income for themselves, UM and their families. How awesome is that? It is pretty sweet? Really really cool? And Chuck it's uh he he tells another story that we didn't use UM where kids in in the surrounding or kids going to school who lived in the surrounding area. It was all agriculture, all farming. And so there's this ongoing debate over whether snow peas or broccoli were more profitable, and UM, these kids did data analysis of all the costs and outputs from broccoli and from snow peas and found, in fact, snow peas are actually more profitable and then they made a presentation and gave it to the town and completely changed them minds of all the farmers around there so they could make more money. Pretty amazing. That is really amazing. Well, it's so amazing that a guy like Howard quit his good job in the United States to move to Guatemala. Most of them, we should say, most of the co ed UH coopetive education is based out of Cincinnati, and most of them live there and they go to Guatemala a few times a year, but they can work remotely because of the Internet and all the great things there. But a few of them actually live in country, and Howard is one of those, and he gave up his life in America. Of course he met a Guatemalan woman. Yeah, I might add something to do with it. And here's what he had to say about that. I think you've seen today that the people here are very expressive, very grateful for the help that we can bring to them. Uh, the kids want to learn. The parents now know how important education is, and that just that just feeds are any emotion that we came to this country with um and so it's it's kind of easy to help in that sense. Um, and really in code. I think all of us who work here have now find found a way to to help development human development a little bit, and we feel like it's like, maybe it's really having an impact. It's we have a mechanism, a system that provides a sustainability and that's key, you know, just to donate something, drop it off and run. We've just seen it over and over. It just doesn't work. So we feel like we're kind of grateful that we have this opportunity to help others. Um. That makes us happy. Hope it makes them happy. Um, And we we'd like to think it's having a real impact. And more, more and more we measure our programs were between seeing good results. Awesome, thank you sir. We meant you. Yeah, glad, I meant you. Guys, We're glad we met Howard. Yeah, he's a cool guy, very cool guy. So we go to the school and they have a big shady tent set up, cool breeze blowing. We're kind of out on the open range. Remember it was like you could see for miles. Oh yeah, it was great, very nice scene. They get this old guy out there to play the harp. But it wasn't like a regular harp. It was this like a harp guitar thing. Do we have any of that harp music? Oh? Is that? It is? That? It? I hear right now? That is it? Yeah? That guy was good. He was very good and like a hundred and thirty and he was very old. And there was some ritual dancing. This is when the little girls came over and picked us up and by the hand. Yeah, and we danced with them. First of many humiliating moments for a man. You're not a big public dancer. No, I've got like that that like plastered grimace of like embarrassment on my face. It's just horrible. Right. It was very cute though, actually, and we had pictures of that that we're gonna have on the website and fantastic. Uh. We thought that we were going to see a live chicken sacrifice right in front of our faces. It came down to the last second. They're doing another traditional Um, this one wasn't the corn dance? Is it just like the symbolic sacrificing of the chicken. It was a it was a Mayan dance, right, and they come out with a live chicken and strangely enough, like earlier in that day. They we've been told that Jeff told us as some of the Mayan ruins they'll find like dead chickens. There's still some blood sacrifices that that are carried on at Mayan ruins. And so within four hours some kids walk out with a live chicken in the middle of a ceremonial dance, and we're like, are they really gonna do this? And this girl like like dropped the chicken and lifted it up and then just slid her hand right off the end of its head, and the chicken was like yeah. And there's literally like twenty Americans in this horseshoe configuration within in the middle, all just thinking, oh my lord, but again with the smiles, places like, hey, it's your culture exactly. I don't want to knock it to each his own right, and I haven't covered in chicken. But luckily the chicken was spared and it was all symbolic and we all breath the little side relief in the chicken, and yeah, the chicken was glad too. They ate him later that night, though, I'm sure. And then we went to the computer lab and this is when the kids actually paired us up and sat us down and they showed us some of the things that they've been working on. And that's when you really get to see the good that co Ed's doing. When you sit down and you see a Windows movie maker slide presentation that a kid in Rurled, Guatemala made who had never seen a computer six months ago. That's where it really hits home. And that was it for that school. Yes, it was, it was. It was a lot think computers, Howard, it sounds like my high school experience. Uh So then we go to the hotel Albert Gas Detech Pond, the weirdest hotel in Glanamala. Yeah, it's a compound. It's not a hotel. It's a compound surrounded by a high wall with razor wire. And the best thing we could describe it was it looked like the Michael Jackson of Guatemala might have owned the property at one point. It was like a Neverland ranch. It had these life size it was like a never Land ranch that had been left out, exposed to the elements for many, many years. It wasn't like nice and new looking. They had like a life size chess game and these yes statues all throughout the property. Each each area was more unsettling than the last. It was a little weird, but it was kind of cool for sure. And uh, before dinner we went to h There was this girl on the trip named Gabby. Yeah, Gabby was I would call her the translator, but Gabby was like everything on this trip. Yeah. She's definitely a jack of all trades for co ED. Yeah. She she's the facilitator pretty much anything we needed. Remember in Antique at the end, when we were you're not supposed to give tours yourself because they have like the city tour people are the only people that are supposed to officially do that, and Gabby like always headed them off at the past and like explain to the cops what we were doing and they're like all right, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, and that works because she is a psychiologist, right, Yeah, that's her background. She went to school, she's a psychologist. Like well, and then she takes time off from her practice. Oh I thought she quit her practice this, I know. She just like takes time off and she's like, you guys go nuts for a little while. I'm gonna go do some co ED stuff. Right, So she's got a really good gig she's educated. Uh, she is one of the more fortunate people in Guatemala too, had not come from a very poor family. Did we say she's Guatemala, Yeah, oh yeah, she's Guatemalan. Did I not mention that? I don't know? She's very Guatemalan and just an awesome, awesome person. And we asked her why that she would, you know, leave her practice, private practice to go work with coed like she does, and she said this, how can I not do it? How can I not believe in this. It's my people, it's my country, it's my kids, and I just love them. And I've have the chance, incredible chance to meet some of them personally and just keep track of them. And I see how they've been like no in their houses, you don't speak any Castellano, any Spanish. And then they're now they're learn English, they know computers. They bought a piece of land and instead of farming, they are constructing, and they're working in a They just have my heart. And Josh's interview went on. She got pretty emotional about what these kids and Guatemala mean to her, and let's just hear what she had to say about that. You can you can grasp or you can take count with their fingers. This the kids that they're they have so much strengthened them, and they're fighting and they're going against everything. So you got the tissues out, buddy. I know it's pretty moving. Yeah, it's really sweet. Um. I'm one of those guys who's just like, yeah, yeah, you've got a hard life whatever. But you know, when you see somebody like Gabby who you almost you almost feel for other people through somebody like that, you know, it was real nice, that's another way to put it. So, Uh, that was the end of our night. Had another awesome dinner steak that night, remember yeah at that place at the roadhouse. Yeah, it was like a roadhouse, and uh, we go to our separate cabins and go to sleep. Jerry had a really creepy went off in the woods. Jerry was scared. First of all, Jerry made me walk or to her cabin, and I'm thinking, I hope Jerry doesn't try to put the moves on me and and um, by the time we get to her cabin, it's been like an hour and a half walk and now I have to walk back in the dark by myself. But it was scary. I was like, all right, see you later. Good look and he helps the scream. It wasn't even that far, but it's funny. Uh. Then we go the next day, we go to an orphanage school and uh we were late because Dan one of the guys on the two her who was like, I'm so surprised Dan just didn't end up walking in front of a horse something like that. Like Dan just things just went wrong for Dan. But he always had a great smile on his Facebook. He couldn't find his alarm clock or something, so he just kept sleeping. That was the first admitting the tour was where's Dan? Incidences that happened? Dan was awesome. Uh. So we we go to this orphanage school and what's said about this one, Josh, is that it was an orphanage. Well, a lot of these kids aren't true orphans, though a lot of them are dropped off. They have parents and families, but their parents know that they can't provide the life for them that they deserve. So the parents dropped their kids off and leave them there and maybe visit once a month or however often they can. And we got one really good story from this school that um remember the girl that went up on stage when they had the little presentation. They do this deal where they sort of have fun with how to take care of the textbooks and and they'll ask different questions. Well they'll they'll tell them how to do it. Then they bring three kids on stage and asked them to repeat what they had just heard about caring for the textbooks, and that they picked two boys and a girl. And the two boys, you know, they were kind of cutting up and laughing and they had nothing to say. But the one girl like knocked everyone out. Yeah she did. We all have presses on the very cute young girl and she completely just like took charge of the room and recited exactly how to take care of the textbooks. And you could tell that she was on the ball right. So um, after the whole, uh, the whole presentation, we were out back interviewing Holly, who had gone and found out this girl's story. Because they co had also identified scholarship students kids were really going to benefit from, like direct help from donors um and this girl had scholarship student written all over. So Holly went and found out what her deal was and she came back and told us. So after the presentation. I called her over to talk to her a little bit, and I asked her what she wants to do, what's her dream in life, and she said that she wants to be a bilingual doctor, which is wonderful. And I talked to her about her parents and what they do, and it turns out that her dad works in agriculture and he travels around to go and work in the field. So he's kind of the lowest level of agricultural worker here in guatemal He probably earns three dollars a day, maybe at the most, maybe two dollars a day. And her mom has left to go be a servant for a family in the city and just comes home on Sundays. So this girl, who is fourteen years old, for the last year, has been going to school full time and doing everything in the house for herself and her ten year old brother and her six year old brother. So she gets up at five in the morning and makes the tortillas, she gets them ready for school. She's basically a little mom and has been for the last year because her parents have gone away to work. And um, you know, I was amazed by this. I couldn't believe that she was doing this, and I asked her why her parents had left to do that, and it's because, uh, neither of them can read, neither of them has any education. They went to school until third grade, but they really didn't pick anything up. And those are the only options they have to get a job that's good enough that it will allow her and her younger brothers to continue their education and to go further in school. So then I asked her, well, why do your parents care. They're they're getting along, they're they're making it somewhat, So why do they care if you have a good education? And uh, she said what most people say is that they wanted opportunities for us that were much better, better than the opportunities that they had. They have no choices in this country. So she kind of captured all of our hearts. I think. I think I said at the time in the interview that if I was a thirteen year old Guatemalan boy, I would ask her to the next dance and then probably to marry her shortly thereafter on the ball and just ride on her coat tails after that. Yeah, she wants to be a bilingual doctor. Yeah, how cool is that? So we took off after that, we went to our last school stop, and this Josh to me, was the best one, mainly because Jerry gave a speech. Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the history of stuff, you should know you're going to hear Jerry's voice. We tried it once before in the Hiccups podcast. We originally had her say boo. It just didn't work out, so it got cut. So here is Jerry the producers voice. It's definitely my honor and privilege to be here with you today. Most of us have come a very long way to be here, UM, to let you know that we care very much about your future. Amente laud uh. These these textbooks here today, UM, are just like any other tool you could ever use. As long as you work hard and you use it correctly, many great things will come from it. UM. I would like to say directly to all of the young women here, you can do great things in your life and it can start here. And I'm I hope to see all of these succeed. And I think that we all feel the same way. Very proud to be here. Your your country is beautiful, You're beautiful people. Thank you so much for having me. It's a man. How awesome was that? It was great. I remember filming this. I had the camera at the time, and I got all choked up, I know. I remember being like, why does Chuck get the camera? Right, I'm gonna go have a cigarette. So this was called the Santiago Cooperative School. And the other cool thing about this, besides Jerry speech, was the principle that ran this joint. Yeah. So this guy was around in in Santa Santiago was a hotbed of of activity during the Civil War, and this guy was a prominent figure in the town and had to shut the school down. Uh. And he was kind of lefty, he liked to you know, he saw things the ten years of Springway, um, and he had to keep his mouth shut. But as he was, he was also quietly building this school so when the civil war ended he could reopen and hit the ground running. And Chuck, like you said, he is a revolutionary and that he um thought girls should be educated, right. Yeah, it's not the most popular notion that that women should have the same rights as men or girls and boys in Guatemala. So he's done a very unpopular thing for many years and and fought to get girls the same rights and the same education as boys. Right, So the the demographics in his school, at least gender wise, are about now right. Well, yeah, and I think a few years previous you could count the number of girls in a school on one hand, and the day that we were there, they were numbered about And you could tell this guy um is very much revered by his students and the people in the communities. They could stand up guy great order actually and again moving experience. Yeah, he could run for the He should run for the president of Guatemala. Yeah, I'd vote for him. I would vote for him in a second. He would I would write in as a writing candidate, as a green go write in that. But like you said, a very effective speaker, very moving and like we went to a classroom him uh later on and he was giving us some more stories and again sap that I am cheered up, Chuck, Yes, can we get some like party resort? Saw some music in right, here is it time? It's time okay and Joshua's this music is playing because we wind up our trip the week in Antigua. Antigua is one of the more popular tourist destinations, and that's where you're gonna find that's where we saw more Americans than anywhere all week because it's lovely, it is gorgeous. It's the old capital, or it was the capital until seventeen seventy six. Yeah, so it's preserved in time basically as the largest city from seventeen seventy six. There's some amazing stuff around there there. It was wrecked by earthquakes over the decades, and some of these churches that were built in the sixteenth I said, sixteenth century, um, and we're just huge collapse partially so we were actually we toured an abandoned well. It was actually still in use, but the back part of it was in ruins, and these huge columns that were like the size of a school bus were just on their side, right in front of you because nobody could do anything with them, and they just fell during an earthquake. But it was it was like these were five year old columns that were just sitting there. It was really amazing, gorgeous. Remember the arch over the main thoroughfare. Uh. And the reason they had that built was because it was a nunnery on either side, and the nuns didn't believe in letting anyone see them or see their faces. So they constructed this walkway above the streets so that the nuns could go from one side to the other. And the town square with the fountain. Very awesome. So we check into our hotel coincidentally also the best hotel of the week. Yeah, the Hotel vih Colonial. This place was awesome, like manicured gardens. Uh, it was. It was really awesome. Some cat helped me carry my bag to my room. You had a bell hut. Yeah, I didn't know man, Oh yeah, I think it was. He didn't do anything else but take my bag to the room. Did you chip him? Yes? And actually I felt bad because I only had like a couple of cats always on and um, which is not much money. No, And I actually found him later on, I think later that night or the next day, and I found him and tipped him better, and he was looking at it was all happy, and one of the guys who spoke English he was tending bar, was like, he thinks he just won the lottery because he gave him Like yeah, So we have a little happy hour that evening by the pool and the gardens, and that's when we were introduced to ron Zakapa yep, who was not our friend. I like him. It is rum. It is aged rum. Yeah, ron is rom in Spanish. And I didn't uh, I didn't know I was a rum guy until I had the Ronza Kappa. Chuck, I don't think that's a very fair characterization. This is not liking ron Za coppa does not make you a rum guy. This stuff is as one of the one of our listeners who commented on the blog during our trip when we mentioned that we were in Guatemala said, try ron Za Kappa. It is the nectar of the gods. It was so. I think we're a little loath to play up alcohol like this, especially because we have younger listeners. But when your kids get to be twenty one, makes your first drink ron Za Kappa, you won't be disappointed. And Josh, we should point out Jerry just stopped us to mention that we had the twenty three year aged Roza. Jesus is a Kappa fan as well. So we have another delicious dinner. Remember the second floor, it's like an open air balcony overlooking the gardens. Delicious. I dined with the Ann I know. By this point we were actually mingling with other people on the trip and and the other tourists, Like we definitely skewed the median age one a little bit one way, right that. Um, but I mean there were there were lots of retired school teachers, um, lots of older women, uh, women of a certain age I should say, who turned out to just be awesome like this, This isn't normally the crowd we run with. And but all of them were just super cool, super fun to talk to. And it wasn't just like polite like you're talking to your friends, you know, grandmother mom kind of conversations like I had really real conversations with these people. And right, it's so weird, like my skin didn't prickle. But um, but but by this night, by this dinner, we were all kind of separated and like mingling with the rest of the tour, like on a really fundamental level. I thought that was cool. Yeah, we all ate dinner with our own little groups, and I charmed everybody at my table. Sure you did. You were like the cool cousin at the wedding. Thank you. Sure. Uh So the next day we uh we took off for town and they the co ed gang, took us on the walking tour that we mentioned earlier when we got in trouble from the local cops, but Gabby worked it out, and that's when we went around to the chapels and the churches and they had a lot of knowledge and it was you know, it's like a really good tour. I've never been on such a good tour in my life. Yes, And the last bus back from the square was leaving, which left Dan running after it, waving and waving with a big smile on his face. And that was the first time we saw a horse diaper. Yeah, I've never seen that, and it was full and it was pretty much what you think it was. It was a diaper on a horse that kind of hung low. Sure, it was weird. So uh. We go on this tour for the first half of the day and saw all this great stuff, and then the second half of the day we meet back in the town square and our group was the three of us and then this guy named Steve who was old buddies with the Burning your Brothers and a co ed supporter all these years, obviously because he's a good friend of the family and believes in what they're doing. And he's a doctor in Cincinnati, right and bilingual, so he went with us, and then we were paired with two kids from the co ed program, a boy and a girl, and they were charged to take us around town while we shopped and helped us like haggle and Jerry took a little shine to the girl there and that was our little buddy. Yes, they turned out to be fast friends. It was very cute. Yeah, which is sort of like the KFC of Guatemala. I'm sorry to just steal your thunder because I mentioned the meal. Yeah, yeah, I didn't eat this meal though. Actually remember I wasn't hungry, that's right, oddly, and so they took his shopping and uh. One of the coolest things on this little excursion was we got together and we're like, hey, let you know, we should buy these kids something because you know how it is when you go to when these kind trees, like these handmade goods are like dirt cheap. And that's not why we decided to buy him something, right, but we can buy one of these kids something. Yeah, we thought, you know, let's let him pick out whatever they want. And we had Steve translate because he was the man in Spanish, and we asked, uh, we told him to tell the kids pick out anything you want, and we'll buy anything you want. And I thought that they would pick out some toy or some like fun thing. The little boy picked out a crucifix cross to where I noticed and that what did the girl get? Jears bracelets for her family. I don't know if that came through, but that was Jerry. But they've already heard her now the cats out of the bag. So that just kind of touched us all, you know, that they were thinking of their family or his religion instead of you know, do they have iPhones around here anywhere? Neither one of them asked that. So we left, We parted company with our kids and um, I already set that up. Dan was running after the bus. Right. Actually, we did a little more shopping on our own. Remember, oh yeah, we did, the three of us. That was fun, Yeah, it was fun. And we ended up back at the hotel um for the last night's dinner, right and the last night's happy hour with more runs a copy, And we didn't explain the runs a cop of thing you're are meant to burn the devil out? Remember, Oh yeah, that's pretty cool. Let's tell him what that is. So when you finished the bottle, you, you rub it. You everyone stands in a circle who's trank it and you rub it all over your buddy and you get it like roll in your in your hands and you get it all warm. You do this for a good five minutes and then you hold the lighter up to the end and this like blue flame comes out. It looks like a caramelizing torch. Yeah, it kind of shoots out, and they call They do that because the Guatemalans believe that if you ingest liquor, then that's the devil living inside of you. So all you gotta do to write the ship is just burn the devil out at the end of the bottle and you're all set bing bang boom. So we did that and that was a lot of fun. We'res in a great mood of this week. We're all buddies, and it was we're all having a blast. So we have the final night they have um a slide show of the week, which is always nice. It's like camp. There was a picture of me fighting a bull with firecrackers on its back. Yeah, we both did that. I was wearing an apron and uh. They did a little slide show which is really nice and then this was Jerry's birthday, so they brought out a cake and they came to me earlier in the night said, hey, do you think if we got a cake it would embarrass Jerry? Yes it would, and yes you should. So they did so, brought the cake out and in Guatemalan tradition, they forced her to put her face in it. Yeah, I'm not sure that was guatemal In like a co ed thing. So Jerry had to take a bite of the cake without using her hands, essentially, and she did it, Yes she did. She was a good sport. Jerry is letting loose at this point. Yes, I saw a whole new side of her. So after after dinner, in the slide show, we had the opportunity everyone there if they wanted to say a few words about their week, uh, to do so, and I, uh put you back in your seat and took the opportunity to speak for the team. Yeah, and I was very very glad you did, because Chuck, you killed it. You had everyone in the room little teary eyed except you. I think I probably was really sure you had the heart strings pulled. I was pulling like a kite, like a box kite. It was very sweet. It was very It was a very good speech, and you you did a good job capturing the this since that we had a kind of our eyes being opened down there and our hearts being open to I appreciate that I spoke from the heart a minute. Good job man. And another one of the people that spoke was Michelle McMaster, Yeah, who we were on the trip with, and um, I don't remember if we were just tired, we didn't want to record anymore. Jerry worked like pretty much the whole time we were down there, we worked a lot. I felt really bad for Jerry. This point, we were like put the camera away for the night. So we we knew Michelle lived in Atlanta, and we're like, well, have you come in and how about we interview in Atlanta because we want to get the perspective of a donor. And she was kind enough to let us off the hook and say yes, So we we did get her perspective, and she did come in and sat down and we asked her some questions about why she was donating to co ED because when we were down there, she was basically on like this distribution tour, a memorial tour for her. UM, her her mother in law, and this is her third trip to guatemal and she was like an old pro at donating. She's not she she doesn't come from this opulent, wealthy family necessarily. She's just a normal at lantin who really figured that this is a good way to to do something with her money. It's just such a poor country and I am so fortunate. I my family is fortunate, and I just feel at this point in my life, I can do something about it, and I can get back, and you know, I hope that a lot of people have the opportunity to do that, because it just it's way better feeling for me than it is for them to receive the books. I mean, they thank us, but I mean I really feel like I should thank them. And Chuck, Um, Michelle was not the only veteran donor that was on the tour with us. You remember Casey and Cathy, Do remember they're very awesome. Yes, they have a little little place in my heart. Yeah. And um, they've they've gotten into sponsoring this is I don't I don't remember how many tours they've been on by the time they went on this one, but um, they've really taken a shine to code and they They and Michelle are very exemplary of the kind of people who go on these tours, especially repeat tours. There are people who are like, you know, I can just take a little bit of this money and it just grows and grows and grows. And I think that's one of the reasons that Coed has such like this loyal following, uh, this really dedicated group of people that they attract and keep because the money stays there, it doesn't get used up. It's sustainable. It's a sustainable model and it's a pretty amazing one too. Yeah. I like, I want to find one person that's gone on one of these tours that comes back and it's like, wow, that was nice, good luck with everything. I don't think it happens like we're we're signed up for life with these guys. Yeah. So after dinner, it's Jerry's birthday, so we decide that we need to go out and celebrate a little bit in town because there's like clubs in Antigua evidently yes, scott clubs, yes, and don't don't you have a little I have a disclaimer here that I'd like to insert. I did not go out that night. I stayed in. I was very tired and happy to stay in, but I was also happy to see you guys go and have a good time, most of the co ed folks. And boy, how doy did you guys go out? Yeah? Yeah, from what I understand. First of all, at breakfast the next morning, I could barely sit at the same table as you guys so bad. Do you want to recount a little bit of this, Well, Josh, I'm really not allowed to say what went on that night. We've all been support to secrecy. But let's just say there was a nightclub involved. There was a band, live band playing Guatemalan sky music. I danced for hours and I am not a dancer, and the next I'm not a dancer. And the next day I woke up with bruises on my hands because I fell out of the back of a pickup truck at some point onto a cobblestone street. It's not it's not good, Chuck. No, it was truly one of the best best nights I've ever had. We kept going the next morning, and you're just like, shut. It was great. It brought me back to my college days as if I was an exchange student in Guatemala, that the experience I never got to live back and you said the band was like right there right, Oh yeah. I mean I've never been to a club that's more crowded in my life and it was just like dancing and sweating and having a great time. It's just that's great. And I've just gotten word from Jerry that it was the best birthday of her life and she's like forty so best speech from you, but wow, best speech from you, best birthday from Jerry. My cold black heart opened up a little bit, you know, like Mr Burns, Oh you're not Mr Burns, Oh thank you. Checking I saw the warmest side of you that I've ever seen, really, and I haven't seen it since, but we'll just call it Guatemala and Josh, okay, you just keep that to yourself. I loved it. Uh Any final final thoughts on the whole trip, Yes, chuck um. Remember we originally went down there to do a podcast on whether education can alleviate poverty, and in very short order we were like, no, this this actually deserves its own podcast. This is a pretty amazing organization. It deserves too. Exactly. It has all that your marks of a great organization that deserves a podcast. It it's an underdog. It's kind of small. It's been chugging along for fourteen years. Yeah, started out super small and it's just just grown and been more successful and amazing yep. UM And there's a lot of really dedicated, genuinely good people who are really giving themselves and not exploiting these this group this is I asked Jeff what percentage of UM donations go to the actual people? And I think the industry standard is like fifty and they're hitting like eight five something like that. That's huge. It's an enormous that's an enormous contribution, you know. Yeah, you know why I figured out is they're all really really smart. Everyone down there that we talked to from co ED was like really sharp and had honed this program down to like an efficient, a really efficient charitable machine. I guess is the best way I can say it. So Shook, I have a feeling that you have some final impressions you'd like to share, and I'm not the only one, I think who wants to hear them. Well, I could just say did oh Josh would do it? You gotta slather it on pud Well like we said, I mean, the people of coed are just doing amazing work. They're unbelievable. The people of Guatemala were just some of the warmest, most welcoming people we ever met, Um, that I've ever met. I know, like you said, they you know, laid down like evergreen bells at our feet when we walked through and the kids came out. You know, remember the last school. They came out and each one of them like hugged us and like ushered us in like one by one, and uh, you know, the principle speaking at the one place. And then people like Caroline who are give up their jobs to go down there and live and teach these kids. It was just the whole thing completely blew me away. Change my perspective on on what we have here, what I have, I'll never look at a pencil the same way again. I'll tell you that excellent And um, I would go back again. And Jerry is going back again. Yes, she's going to get in the summer. They have taken a shine to her and vice versa. Yeah, she's doing some video work for them, which is pretty cool. Yeah, she's going on the July Snapshot tour. Right. Yeah, So anybody who wants to go hang with Jerry and Guatemala can that's your chance. Yeah, uh and Chuck. If people want to see pictures of our Guatemalan tour, the one we've already been on, we have them on the site. You created an image gallery, right, Yeah, seventy photos of us and Guatemala. Get a pencil out or a pen people write this down. We're also going to post this on Facebook if it's too long for you, but for you non facebookers, it is www dot adventure dot how Stuff Works dot com, slash stuff dash you dash should dash no dash, Guatemala dash pictures dot htm. So essentially it's Adventure, how Stuff Work, stuff you should know, Guatemala pictures right with hyphens in between. Yeah, and like I said, we'll put it on Facebook and tweet it out and uh so those of you in the know, well we'll have an easier time with that. And if you want to know more information about the Cooperative for Education co ED, the work they do, that's you man, you know all about them. I'm talking to the people now. Um, you can log onto their internet website at www dot co ED. You see dot org that c o E D You see dot org and Jerry tells us that you can just type in Cooperative for Education and this U r L bar and it'll redirect. Yeah, they got info on their website about UM the tour that you can take. It's not very expensive actually just to go down there for a week. They really take care of you. They have like you know, security with you. It's really safe. UM. I guarantee you will have a life changing experience. And they haven't got a video about the tour are on there that you can watch, and I defy you to watch it and not get a little tear eyed. Uh. And it's all there on the website all the information and you should check it out for sure. To check that out. And again, if you want to donate the co ed UH, you can text a five dollar donation by texting the word stuff s t U F F yeah to to zero two to two. You'll donate five dollars. You'll receive a text back asking you to confirm the donation. Simply reply with the word yes to complete the donation right, and we have to say a one time five dollar donation will be charged your wireless bill or deducted from your prepaid balance. Messaging and data rates may apply. If you change your mind before confirming the donation, you can amply stop to two zero to two two, or if you need help, reply the word help. Donations are collected by the Mobile Giving Foundation. For more info, you can call eight six six eight one oh one two zero three or go to h m g F dot org slash t what a website. Huh wow, nice job man. Thanks. Uh. And some wireless carriers limit the number of donations you can make, so you check with your wireless carrier if you want to make more than one. Yeah, and uh. On a personal note, I just want to say we've had awesome response from our Kiva sponsorships. So we kind of talked the stuff you should know Army up to co Ed and we said, uh, five dollar text, that's the way to go. Like, these people will definitely hear the story and they'll definitely want to throw five bucks your way. And uh, so I just want to literally, we don't ask people for much often, but I'm gonna ask you to do that text five dollars and um, the clock is sticking a little bit because these text donation campaigns they're not like they don't run in perpetuity. So I think it's through what is it jars into July. So pick out your phone right now, just do a little quick text. Like we said, five bucks, we'll buy textbooks for one student for an entire year year and then it goes into the Revolving Fund and it's self sustainable and essentially you bought textbooks for life. And if you want to donate more, you can go to their website. They have information on how you can, like you can actually sponsor a computer center, get your name on it and go down there and visit it and cherish it and hug it. And now you can go to their website and they have all kinds of information on how you can get more involved or go on a tour. And it's really really great. And listen to us, Chuck, I mean, like, really, we sound like we are hosting a telephon. I I never thought that I would I would be doing something like this, And I think to the very fact that we are doing it hopefully lend some sort of credence to to how we actually feel about co ED. Absolutely, we wouldn't be doing this for any uh fly by Night nonprofit. These guys are great, So again, If you want to learn more about co ed, go to www. Dot co ed. You see dot org. Uh and we're gonna post pictures on our blogs. Uh No, I'm gonna set up an image gallery and we will put that on Facebook and then the blog.
