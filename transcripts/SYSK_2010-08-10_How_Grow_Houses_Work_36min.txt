Josh: Welcome to stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. We also want to extend a welcome back to Yeddi. Jerry, Yeah, who just got back from Guatemala. Yeah, herd second tour of duty with co ED. Yeah, she just got back. Yeah. You know what, quickly, Josh, I should mention because I promised an I would do this. Co ed uh still has their text donation campaign going. Oh yeah, you can still do it. Yeah, they left it open. So if you wanna um buy um school books for life for Guatemalan child, you can do that for five dollars by texting the words stuff to two zero to two two very nice, and texting data rate supply and on that gobbledegook. But yes, we would raise a lot of money and it's still open. So she said you should remind people from time to time. That's great. Then Jerry just came back all like rosy from Guatemala again. I know she's that country gut under her skin. Yeah yeah, now she's getting under its skin. I don't even know what that means. Oh, I know what it means, so, Chuck. Yes, Um, are you familiar with the state of California. I lived there. Yes, you did, didn't you. Um, Well, Kelly's got a proposition on the ballot that's November, right. Have you heard of Prop nineteen? I have. Prop nineteen would make if California passes it, it would make California the first state to legalize marijuana consumption by adults. Yeah. What's on the ballot right now on Prop nineteen is if you're over twenty one, you'd be able to possess and consume and make a hat out of up to an ounce of marijuana. Yeah, just like alcohol. Would be treated much like alcohol. Um, you wouldn't be You wouldn't be allowed to have it around schools at schools, can't sell it, can't pick up your kids with like, you know, your ounce tucked in your front pocket or something like that. Um. But you can also grow it in an area up to square feet really if you can. From what I saw, this was an outdoor garden. I didn't see anything about indoor gardening. Interesting, which just so happens to be what this podcast is about. Look at you in your little intro. It's been a while. Oh, yeah, it has been nice. Sorry for the hiatus. That's right, we're back. So what you were talking about was a grow room if it's a t square feet. But what we're gonna could be a very very tiny house, the doorhouse, a doghouse. We're gonna talk about grow houses. And uh, Robert Lamb wrote this article and that's all I need to say. You know it's good bam. Yeah, yeah, he always gets real cheeky in his articles. He does. He started out this article, which is a fine, fine article. Um. And if you ever wanted to see a lot of pop plants in an article on how stuff works dot com, this is your chance. Um. He starts out talking about how people like house plants. And you know, if you have a house plant that could net you a thousand dollars after harvesting once, why not do that? And if one can do that, why not dedicate your whole house to growing these plants? And that's pretty much what a grow house is. Well, but because it's illegal, Josh, that's the answer. That is the answer, actually, and thank you, Chuck. I think we should start this one off by saying we how stuff Works Discovery or anybody were affiliated with don't endorse grow houses in any way, shape or form, And this is just about how they operate. That's all right, nothing else. I've got a load of stats. Can we start with that. Let's do it, man. I dug out some stats on marijuana use, uh Josh from a u N report. Worldwide, a hundred and forty seven people, A hundred and forty seven million people use marijuana regularly as of two thousand two, and percentage wise, it has led. Guess what country would you think percentage percentage percentage wise Luxembourg, it's a good guess. I would have guess Jamaica, just because I'm an idiot and I'm like, yeah, bub Marley, right, Papua New Guinea of their country regularly uses marijuana, the only country in the world where an outbreak of CURU has occurred, and followed by Micronesia and Ghana, and then I think South Africa is right after that. South Africa is pretty populous. Yeah, well, they're smoking a lot of weed. Well that's about worldwide. That's about ten times the number of people that smoke it in the US. Right, Well, there's different stats when you talk about pot use. Um there. You can't leave the pot heads a compile decent stats. Well, there's always the one stat where they're like, have you ever tried it? And so if you're talking about that, um of the American population over the age of twelve has tried marijuana one time, jarringly eight percent of the population under the age of twelve has tried it. Not true. Well you didn't see that one coming. Not true. But as far as use regular use, I think fourteen point eight million Americans regularly, I'm sorry, I do have that they use marijuana in the past month. Fourteen point eight percent and twenty five percent of Americans report that they've used it in the last year at least once. So don't you always feel bad for that one person who like hasn't used to smoke pot all the time and then quit smoking for years and then smoked it and then like three and a half weeks later survey and it's like, yes, yes, I have r Really, that's not an accurate reflection. It was a college thing. And then again three and a half weeks ago, but that was it, right, Yeah, when my college friend visited anything. So those are the stats on marijuana use. If you're talking grow houses, Um, Robert included a couple of cool ones in Humboldt County, California, which is known for its good marijuana and lots of it. They I think it says one thousand out of the homes in that county are grow homes. Yes, because they supply a lot of the medical marijuana in California. Yeah, and they enjoy some protection from the government, at least the county government, if not I guess the state government too, because California has had uh legalization of medical marijuana sin. So, but apparently that covers the growers and the sellers, but not the people who transport it. Yeah, which is interesting. It is, which is it's gotta be a nerve wracking job. You know. It's like you're the only one left out there. Uh. And I think Vancouver is the other cool stat was in Vancouver, Canada, one out of every five house this is a grow house, they say. Apparently the um the the grow house. The pot growing industry in British Columbia employed an estimated twenty thousand to sixty thou people in two thousand and Um, they're two thousand. Yield was like four billion dollars worth or something. Wholesale jeez, I've got one more stat because I promised in Atlanta stat when we did our prison podcast and Georgia was like the number one in prisons. Either that or you will eventually that promise. I'm not sure which order we're releasing these, but Atlanta, Georgia. Of the people arrested in Atlanta, uh say they have smoked pot within the past month, arrested for whatever? Really? Yeah, and that leads the nation in the A T L. Yeah, Stone like them white boys smoking them white buds. All right, Josh, grow houses, let's do this, all right, Chuck. If you are a grow house operator, like you said, it's not just grow room you got going. Your entire house is dedicated to growing marijuana. It's a big business. It's a huge business running your own business essentially, right, and you have a lot of stuff to pull up, put up with. It's a very high stressed job, especially in areas where it is in no way, shape or form legal, which is most places. Not only are you um prime for being robbed by armed gun men who just want to basically take all your pot or your money, or unarmed potheads you just want on your rippers, is what they're called of yours homegrown Billy Bob Thornton. Oh, yeah, is that what they're calling. Yeah, I haven't seen that in a while. Um. Let's see. You've so you've got being ripped off or being shot while you're being ripped off. You've got the cops. Um, you have basically the people who are buying from you that you have to keep happy. Um. But really, at the center of this, from what I understand, is the plant, right, and it's this isn't just a this is not The operations are not just I've got some plants growing around. These are incredibly intense farming operations. Um, very sophisticated, and they are very people have figured out what the ideal conditions to grow marijuana is and we will share them now. Yeah, and not only grow marijuana, but they figure out the ideal conditions to grow the most potent um, the most dense marijuana per plant, so you get the maximum bang for your buck when you get a cell like apparently a well informed indoor operation produces pot with fifty more THC than the stuff growing outdoors. Really that's what I read. Uh, So, Josh, there's a couple of ways you can do this. Um, you can grow it um in soil like just a regular role plant, or you can grow it hydroponically, which is pretty popular these days. Hydroponics Josh is um. You've probably heard that name on the news, and if you didn't know what it was, it it means that you're not using soil. It's a plant growing without soil, right, they use a nutrient rich water. Yeah, it's not just pot plants. You can grow anything hydroponically or I don't know about anything, but yeah, I think pretty much any plant you could grow hy Anybody who's been Epcot has seen hydroponics in action exactly. Yeah. I think they grow big old hydroponic tomatoes down there. Really. Yeah, but basically you're you have you are showing human domination and exploitation over a plant when you grow it without soil and just a nutrient rich solution. Yes, and uh so, what you're talking about are containers and trays, drip systems, automated watering systems or manual humidifiers humidifiers and I mean these are just a few of the things you need for hydroponics. Well, and not just not just hydroponics. I mean you're probably gonna need a dehumidifier, a drip irrigation system. No matter how you're growing, the plants can be fairly demanding, right yes, Um, And you're also going to need light, lots of light because with a grow house, you'll find, as we keep talking, um, most grow houses are totally sealed off from the rest of the world for very good reasons. So they they're creating this artificial environment and so there's no sunlight whatsoever that ever touches these plants. Um. It's all basically thousand horticulture bulbs, UM. And apparently those can sustain twelve to fifteen plants. And as Robert puts it into perspective, this is a thousand wat bulb and the average incandescent light bulb in a house UM runs from forty watts to a hundred and fifty watts, Right, chuck, have you ever turned a hundred and fifty what light off and unscrewed it real quick? It's very hot, And that's a hundred and fifty These guys are using a thousand watt light bulbs and that's just for twelve to fifteen plants. So if you have a couple of hundred plants in a house, that's sealed off her medically. It's gonna get kind of hot, right, Yes, it is. Let's talk about those lights for a minute. Thousand wants a piece. What you're doing is trying to mimic the sun, so obviously you want it to be very powerful. And the other thing you're doing is you're you're affecting how this plant actually grows. The life cycle and the growing and the budding cycle of this plant. You can completely control if you're growing indoors, because the sun is not there to get in the way. You can fake it all. Yeah. You can use reflectors to get as much UM light as you can, so it's it's being exposed to light directly by the bulb and indirectly from this some reflective I guess material. Yeah right, um you I think they've figured out that what is sixteen to eighteen hour days are optimal to get them started. Yeah, that's the beginning of the of the growth period. And then when you want your plant to flower, you slow it down, you shorten the days, and then all of a sudden boop. And this also may for bigger, denser buds. Yeah. And for those of you not hip to the cause, that's where you That's that's where the money is. That's where the Yeah, it's a flowering plant and the flower is the bud and it's the female that flowers. So all the plants in there in the grow house are female. They weed out all the males, and they're essentially controlling the sun to to an extent where they can produce this super potent pot. Right, And if you look for this article on hostaff Works, you will find it very appropriately in the flowering plants subchannel. Is it? Yes? Interesting, This could go on a lot of sub channels. It definitely like the adventure channel or entertainment. I don't know. So you talked about the heat. That is the big it is a problem also, um electricity is a big problem to chuck because think about it. Remember we said that averaging cadescent bulb is forty two hundred and fifty watts. You're running several thousand wat bulbs and like your average living room is just wired to handle one most living rooms can handle one one WA bulb, which means you better known electrician A and be that electrician. Better love free pot because you're gonna need to rewire your house. Yeah, rewire the house a lot of times they'll jack into the A lot of times I'll hire former or current power company employees to help him out. Current power company, very nice, Bullett, and uh they will sometimes they will rewire that the home or the grid on that street. That will re reroute power to your house, which messes everyone else up and potentially maxes out the grid in your area. Yes, it does do that also exposes everybody to electrocution. If you didn't use a power company guying, you tried it yourself. Yeah, which is a really bad idea. No matter what you're stealing power for to grow pot because you don't like paying utility companies, it doesn't matter. Rewiring the electricity that's coming into your house is a really bad idea. Yeah. That's how my granddad died. No, it's not, Yeah, no, it's not. Yeah, he was. He was knocked from a telephone pole. He was electrician. He wasn't like rewiring for grow houses. But he was like thirty feet up in a telephone pole. And you know, you you test out the wire by hitting the back of your hand to it, or you did back then, because if you did the front of your hand, it can grasp ahold of it, so he hit it on the back of his hand. It was a live wary and it knocked him out of the pole and he landed on his head and then spent the next like a few years in a hospital bed was ruling, and then he died. What a little kid. I didn't know. That's the most amazing dead grandfather's story. I know, very sad well, and I never hardly knew him. So h Getting back to the heat though, Um, finally, marijuana. If you have a house, a girl house full of these lights, it could potentially be a hundred degrees fahrenheit inside your house at night at night. So that's a problem because it's really hot and that's not comfortable. And by the way, that's thirty eight degrees celsius for friends who don't live in libraria. But it's also a problem because marijuana grows best between seventy and eighty degrees and can do okay up to about if it's a CEO two rich environment, right, and they have to do artificially. They figured out that that's kind of what you want, I guess from indoor grow houses. These horticulturists to figure it out that you do want to keep it hot, because you do want the CEO to environment Richard, because again it produces thicker, denser, bigger buds, which is bigger money. Again yes, uh. And so to combat the heat though, what they do is they put a lot of a lot of air conditioning units ventilation fans uh to maintain their temperature. And Robert pointed out that one one thousand what bulb requires a fan and tw eight a single fan and twenty hundred British thermal units of cooling and a typical five tons a C unit puts about sixty b t u s out right, so you're you're central A C unit outside of your house could conceivably handle you know, a small house grow operation, right, but it has to run constantly, which again means that you are using up the juice and a fan on each plant. So if you've got two D plants, you've got two hundred fans running on top of the a C unit. Like you can assign a fan to a lot more than one plant. Well, if you don't know what you're doing, check just proved his innocence, that's right. The other thing that's a problem is just like any plant that you're growing, is insects and mildew and spores, fungus. I got more on that in a second, but yes, well let's hear it. No, well, the way they combat that jerk is uh charcoal filtration, Uh increasing CEO two levels that kill these things. Yeah, it's also good for the plants. Yeah. I thought that was really clever because you think about it, an insect needs oxygen to live to right, so you just jack up the CEO two levels suffocates everything and um, but your plants are like, oh yeah, bring it on. And the other thing you'll do is I'll just seal it off from the outside world. So you're domatically sealed off. Yeah, as a few insects as possible. Yes, So chuck. Um. Not only does seiling off your plants, your whole grow operation, your entire house um from the outside world good for your plants. Number one, you don't have you have completely climate controlled conditions. You have a natural gas burner to introduce more c O. Two. You um, you know exactly what the temperature is going to be because you know how many lights you have going. You have your a C set to the perfect temperature. Um. It also prevents the cops from getting hip to your operation, right, is it's illegal? Well, yeah, you mentioned the charcoal filter for outgoing air. You still have to vent your air, right yeah. Um, so you you have a charcoal filter, it's gonna cut down on the smell of pot because, as Robert points out, pot has a very distinctive smell, and hundreds of pot plants have a really really strong distinctive smell. Right, So the coffee can isn't going to cover that up. No downy or a paper talel toe with downy seats on the end, Now, that's not gonna work. So you're right. They used the filtration systems to send the air back out and hopefully your neighbors are never wise to the fact that their their person living next door to them probably isn't even living next door. It's probably just full of marijuana plants. Many times it is. Well, remember you said that you want ideally, if you're going to steal electricity, you want a guy from the power company to do it. Um. And one of the reasons why you would steal electricity is um because the power company will notice if you have a power bill that's six to seven times the average for the house your size, and it's like that every month that's gonna tip them off. A lot of growers will stagger the days. Like let's say you have a grow house, but your house is is set up into several different rooms, so each room would represent you know, you have a day going in one room, and then it's nighttime and a couple other rooms, and it's starting a day in another room. So you're you're using the least amount of electricity at once, right, Um, and it's staggered. Powered companies know to look for that kind of thing and they'll turn in they will. So a lot of growers will um use generators. Right. But these, first of all are very expensive ten thousand to twenty tho bucks. Right, Yeah, that's that's for the big, the big daddy that can like run your whole house. Right. Apparently a fifty light fifty light thousand watt grow operation needs about eighty kilowatt, so you do need a big daddy generator. Problem is, big daddy generators are super super loud. And again if you are you know, not in a rural area, which most grow houses are not out in the sticks, just because there's not that many houses out there right there in the suburbs. So you really have to figure out how to deftly steal your electricity, or you have to figure out how to mask the noise of your generator. Yeah, the other problem with the generator is it can break down. You're not tied to the grid. And if your generator breaks down at the wrong time and you've got two hundred thousand dollars worth of pot growing in your house, that means your business is in jeopardy. So it's a fire hazard. I mean, generator is not necessarily the smartest way to go. No um. And in the same way that that electricity or the need for electricity presents a problem and a requirement, so too does a need for water. Right, you gotta water your plants. Even if you have an extremely efficient system, right, an automatic drip system, you're still going to use a lot more water than you normally would in a house. So number when you get the water company keeping tabs on this water usage that in the house's history has never been remotely like this, they'll turn you into right. Um, But again, people have figured out how to steal water. Um. Those water meters they actually there there. They have paddles that are spun by the water that's coming into the house. So people have figured out that you can drill holes in these paddles so more water passes through than its detected, and that just primitively ingenious. Yeah it is. Yeah, I didn't know that until I read this. Josh. Let's talk about managing a grow house a grow house and how how you how you would do that. There's a lot of factors because it is a business. Um, you've got a lot of money coming in out, You've got people you've got to manage. Yeah. I didn't really realize this that a lot of them are set up by secret investors. It's not just organized crime or really really ambitious potheads. It's very likely not a very ambitious pothead. If you've got a grow house, like a grow room, maybe, but a grow house is very likely run by somebody else in a larger organization, right, and that person probably will never set foot in that house. No, they'll fund it right with cash that can't be traced back to them, but they will probably never go near it right through. They probably don't smoke pot that's my guess. They look at it like units. Yeah, theyre's making money. Sure. Uh. We talked about people that work there. It is not necessarily like the Billy Bob Thornton movie with a dude and his buddies running their grow house. A lot of times it's more nefarious, and it's um someone who has been brought into the country illegally to repay a favor for being brought in. They may say, all right, you gotta sort of be are indentured servant here and work at this grow house for so long, for this one season or whatever. But yeah, there's a big problem. One of the big arguments against the poorous border in the south of the US is that coyotes make people smuggled drugs act as mules when they're running through the desert, you know, getting into the US. They have they tend to have lots and lots of drugs on them. They're being exploited. I didn't realize that they were forced to manage grow houses too, but that was pretty interesting. Well, see that a prostitution, but it's specifically in California, he said. The Vietnamese immigrants tend to have to do this to pay off debts. Absolutely. Well, I think I'd rather work in a grow house and be forced into prostitution. You would it take you forever to pay off your debts as a prostitute. I appreciate that. I think, uh so that is how you would manage it with temporary workers. Um, during the season, when it's the harvest season, you might bring in additional workers. And chances are these people aren't on the up and up either. They're not your buddies. It's maybe illegal immigrants once again, right. And one of the reasons why you would not want this position is because again this is a very dangerous job to have. Um. Even if this isn't your stuff, you have no idea what's going on. You just came in the country illegally. You're nervous about that to begin with, but even more nervous because you are spending your first few months in an illegal grow house. Um. Which is why, as we said, most grow houses are not in the rural areas there in the suburbs here in Georgia, tons of them all over They're always Gwynette Henry, They're all over the place. Um. And so you want your house to blend in in every way, shape or form. Right, And as Robert said, this can be uh, this can include buying garden gnomes just like a regular dude. Yeah. Um, you want to keep the the um the flow of traffic to a minimum, but you don't want it to look like no one ever comes there because that's pretty suspicious as well. You want to be friendly, I imagine, but you don't want anybody to be to feel comfortable asking questions personal questions, that kind of thing. You don't black out your windows with aluminum foil, No, you don't, not that kind of thing. You want your wrote rooms within the grow house to be like just like I said, within the house, right. And also there's um, you remember we talked about infrared cameras that cops used to bust grow houses because they could sense heat. Do we talk about that? We talked about this like in some other podcast. Remember I crashed the case on it. Um. So apparently one way to combat this in a girl house is a room within a room, right, So you're when you're sealing it off, you're not using your whole the whole room in the house. You're allowing you're basically setting up a room within a room to grow in so that that the outside room can kind of keep it cool. So from a helicopter, when you're looking at a house, it doesn't look like it's putting out more heat than average, right, or like, look that that guy is clearly an illegal Vietnamese immigrant because he's sweating bullets in there exactly. That's that's the that's the level of hundred degrees in their home. Yet they're running their A C unit constantly. The silly people. So, josh, you got a neighbor, they're pretty cool. They never cause you any problems. They're real quiet. They keep their yard nice and trim in their garden, homes shiny. What's the what's the problem? Then, if someone has got to grow house next door to you, why wouldn't you want that? Well, first and foremost, you don't want people coming to rob them. Okay, that's one thing when we talked about the electrical grid, So it can mess up your electrical system, yeah, or pose a fire risk to your neighborhood if you are in any way shape or form an environmentalist. Um, the idea of somebody using six to seven times the average of a normal single family residents in electricity, you realize that that adds to a lot more pollution, yeah, um, And it also can add to it much more directly. In two thousand eight, in Humboldt, there was an environmental disaster where a thousand gallons of diesel fuel spilled into a local creek and it was for it was from a generator really um that was operating a grow house out in the sticks, out in the woods. UM. And actually, as a result of that, Humboldt County has undertaken a public service announcement campaign for local growers, urging them to go like to get greener in their practices because there's really not an environmentally friendly means of cultivating plants indoors. Well, dude, if it's gonna happen anywhere, it's gonna happen in northern California because they are very green and they love their weed. Another problem, Chuck, if I may, you may, thank you. Uh. And with indoor growing, um, all the conditions needed to um encourage an outbreak of black toxic mold, they're all present. Apparently, toxic mold outbreaks have been linked to grow houses, and those actually drive up the homeowners insurance of everybody in the area. Which one house has black mold, everybody's insurance goes up. Well, it's yeah. And that's the other thing too, is chances are when you leave the grow house behind or when you're busted, it's probably not gonna be some like great house left in good condition. It's probably ransacked and maybe water damaged or or heat damaged. And that's gonna obviously bring down the property value in your neighborhood too, So most decidedly that's another good reason. But if your neighborhood already has low property values thanks to foreclosures and abandoned houses that have boarded up windows and doors, you are basically living in an area that is absolutely perfect for grow houses. One of the unintended, unexpected consequences of the current housing crisis in South Florida grow houses in huge neighborhoods that have abandoned in forclosed houses like the High Acres. Yeah, Auban's apparently are big into it down there, Well, Florida's way into it. I was trying to find the biggest grow house that's ever been busted. And by the way, if you type into Google news search for the year two thousand ten grow houses, you get a hundred and eighty four articles just on grow house busts this year on Google News. They're all over the place. But the biggest one I found, and this may not be the biggest, but there was one in Lake County, Florida, where there were two thousand plants in this home. And I remember there was one I saw an article when I was working at my last job where this I think it was in Tennessee where they showed this dude's grow house and he had in the in the basement rear of the house, there was this hatch and all of a sudden, in this hatch was a You opened the door and there was a you know, a fifteen foot diameter tunnel that went like a hundred feet into this mountain where there was more operations going on, Like this dude tunneled into the side of a mountain from his basement and they busted him. And these are the just the bust. I mean, imagine how many of there are still operating on a daily basis all around the country. Well that was another thing too, um the you you talked about real estate prices being driven down by a busted girl. House prices can also go up if, especially if an organization who's funding these things decides that they want to buy a dozen houses in a suburb suburban area at once, you know, in a small enough area, that's gonna really affect that the housing prices in the area and drive them up because it's it's reducing the supply of available homes. Yeah, pretty interesting stuff. I thought this whole thing was good. I thought so too. If you want to read this great article by Robert Lamb, you can type in grow houses on the search bar at how stuff works dot com. Again. Again, again, cannot stress this enough. This podcast, in no way, shape or form, represents any kind of endorsement of any illegal activity whatsoever. Yeah, people always ask us, you know, you should cover pot legalization or cover drugs in different ways, and we've wanted to because it's really interesting and it's a part of the American fabric. You can't just ignore it, be like, what are you talking about? That's not interesting? But it's it's tricky for us, you know. Well, yeah, it's hard to talk about grow houses and explain how to do it without sounding like we're giving a tutorial on how to do it. But the way I look at it, Chuck, is ultimately our goal or the goal of the site, is to explain absolutely every aspect of the world. Yeah, including ticks. One at a time, including roots sixty six including grow houses and everything else in between the track. So, Chuck, what is it time for listener mail? Do we have it? Yep, I've got one today, Josh. I'm gonna call this our best voodoo email. Dear Chuck and Josh, I just listened to your voodoo podcast and thought I had a fun story you might like. I was dating a guy back in two thousand seven who I thought was deeply religious, had lots of statues all around his house, sat candle's and a very odd quote spice rack unquote. Around our third week together, I found out he practiced voodoo and was an actual bocor bocor Ore voodoo sorcerers. I think we pointed this out of the podcast, as he told me they served a looa with both hands and practice both white and black magic. All the statues were for the voodoo rituals he performed, and he could keep them out, uh, keep the bad spirits out, and not worry about his very Catholic roommate who would also not stay around. Clearly, even though he should have explained to him that there were a lot of of Catholicism and voodoo, I was not on good terms with my parents at the time. There were Mormons who work in the temple. Oh yeah, mom and dad, this guy and this is the guy too, So he's obviously gay as well. So he's probably not popular with his parents, his Mormon parents, I would think, as far as we can tell. As far as we can tell, they may have loved him being a gay guy dating a voodoo bocrest. So anyway, the black magic practicing boyfriend was right up my alley at the time. This is from uh Mal and Tri Cities, Washington. And I actually confirmed that I could read this on the air because it's a little you know, tricky, and he said sure because he was a big jerk, So go ahead and read it. Okay, Thanks Mal.
