Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. Here is Charles w dr kunk Eliasis Bryant How you doing drunk? That sounds like my play a name? It is sort of player appreciate dot Com. I wish I could remember what that name was. Was so good? Oh it was we pastic Bryant Trump. Is that it sugar tastic Bryant Trump. Sugar tastic? That's it, Bryant Trump. Yeah, that means Chuck's put name is as it's as its appears on player appreciate dot Com. I love that you can generate a play a name. Yeah, it is a pretty cool couples the Internet, Chuck, speaking of the Internet. Yes, our parent company, Discoveries Channel Animal Planet UM has a cool website. Indeed that they launched for their show Monsters Inside of Me. Very cool, which has inspired us to do a couple of parasite podcasts. This is two of two. Yeah, number two. We just did um a toxoplasmosis. Yeah, and I gotta say we were excited about this stuff. It's actually we'll get requested to do things and we're like, oh, I don't know, should we do that. We'll turn them down and they'll threaten to fire us, and then we'll march into the office with a gas can and a lighter. It goes down like that. But this one is cool. Monsters inside Me, cool show. Yeah No, everybody on staff pretty much threw in for this thing, and happily actually because yeah, it is a cool show. That's a cool graphics. It's just gross. Yeah, it is um. And if you're eating lunch or dinner right now, we might advise you to wait until later listen to this. I actually was eating a sub while I was researching Leashman is sis tape worm sub? No, that's the flesh eating I know, just was it a taper and stub? It was undercooked meat, so yeah, probably. Um. Anyway, we're talking about parasites and apparently pimp names and uh, let's get into it. We're talking about three really gross ones, and technically we should say four because I want to give a shout out to my favorite and Chuck. Also, I should probably say anytime we do a segmented um podcast. Chuck likes the timing because he's a big fat jerk. I don't like to time you. But if we want to get to all three, we need only have a certain amount of time. And so I'm gonna go ahead and hit start on my new iPhone. Okay, well, dracunculish jerk, We're supposed to do a Leisha manisis. Oh yeah, Alisha maniasis. Sorry, man, that's what we're starting with. This is the flesh eating parasite. It is. It's affection affectionately known tropics subtropics in southern Europe. So we're safe for now, well, unless we travel to one of these countries, which you were prone to do. I yes, I am wanting to go to certain places sometimes. But yeah, there's a lot of people who actually um suffer from Alisha maniasis. Estimates are are about twelve million infective worldwide and three fifty million at risk. Yeah, and about two million new cases each year. And they're expecting this to go up, Chuck, thanks to our friend climate change, Thank you, al Gore. Um. Because as the temperatures increase, the area where the sand fly, which uh increases as well. And yeah, it's the sand flight which I wasn't familiar. I think I had sand fly and black fly confused. But luckily black flies don't spread um. Leashmanis the sand flies to and these are actually about a third of the size of mosquitoes. You know, your bits are relatively painless if they're if they're not pain free. Um. So yeah, you don't know that you're being bitten, and you certainly don't know that the the saliva from this fly has actually just transferred um some larva of this parasite into your blood stream. And you know I should point out to you said that global warming is one reason this is on the rise. Another reason is because of our shenanigans in the Middle East, because it is that place is lousy with sand flies in Afghanistan and Iraq and the like. So we think a lot of our personnel over there maybe getting infected in bringing it back. So leishmaniasis mission accomplished. Yeah, so, Chuck. Actually, the the concentration of where these cases are popping up is concentrated in just a handful of countries, Old World and New World. Um. But there are places like Syria and Brazil have the vast majority of these cases because it's where the sand fly lives. But like you said, traveling conquering, these things can can can transfer tourism and conquering. Yeah, leishmaniasis. Right, So there's actually two kinds and a sub kind. The sub kind is my favorite. The cutaneus is my favorite? Is it because I want to describe the sore If you had the cutaneus, uh, lee, maniasis, this is what's gonna happen. You're getting get a sore in your skin. What happens is as followed and uh, this is so gross. They describe it. The sore is ending up looking like a volcano. So it's got a raised edge and then a central crater, a little meaty central crater right in the middle. Do you at least maniasis on your breast? That's gross? And some some of the sores are indeed covered by a scab and they can be painless or painful. Painful your breast is yeah. Yeah, So my favorite, chuck, if you'll allow me to take over for a moment, is mucosal or muco cut This is the stuff that like you see photos of when you type in flesh eating parasite, right, Yeah. What happens is is you get a cutaneous parasitic infection, and uh, it can spread to your mucous membranes, eat your lips, your nostrils, that kind of thing. Basically, the prominent features on your face get eaten away. Did you google image any of these? Yeah? Yeah, so are you eating at the time? No, I was not. It's amazing like people missing their noses. I saw one where it was a close up of this guy's nose and somebody had tweezers. It was just kind of pulling it and it was a still photo, but you could tell by the way it was being pulled. It was basically like jelly. It's gross stuff, but that's that They actually clear up on their own eventually. We read an article from the CDC describing leashmaniasis, and I was just considered to find you know, under the how do I treat leishmaniasis, they're basically like, well, it goes away on its own eventually, basically like there is no treatment, but it said it could take months or years. So do you want a volcano, uh, scab on your forearm for years or that thing on your breath gross? Uh. There's a really dangerous one though, called visceral. Yeah, so tell us about that, chuckers. Yes, Josh, this is the nasty one. This is the one that attacks your liver and spleen and I think it in large just them. Well, your spleen actually can become larger than your liver, which ain't supposed to happen. That ain't supposed to happen, and even your liver and uh it is liver shrinking and hardening. Oh is that what happens? Okay, so your liver's like a California raising pretty much. And then not the dancing kind of the dying kind. Yeah. Um yeah, it'll kill you. It will. And like you said, it is nasty in that it is dangerous. It's not as nasty as um muco cutaneous leashmaniasis, but it's still pretty dangerous stuff. So you want to know how how this uh, this parasite, Uh, this parasite's life cycle occurs. It's pretty interesting actually. So you get bit by a sand fly, right, and the parasite actually is taken up. It enters the bloodstream and it's taken up by macro phages, which are a type of white blood cell. So they're living happily and protective within the macrophages where they're reproducing, and eventually they cause the cell to lice. Dat erupts and they're all of a sudden, all these new um parasites are released into your bloodstream and then they're taken up by more white blood cells and so on and so on, so the process keeps continuing and they start multiplying exponentially. Yeah, which is also how it's flesh eating. When when it's attacking these cells, it's it's liz ing the cells in your mucous membrane or around your like on your forearm or something like that or uh, in the case of visceral leashmaniasis, your internal organs. But like we said, don't worry about It'll just go ahead and according to the c d C. All right, change your press the timer. Man, we're dumb in this one. Okay, So that's leashmaniasis. Yes to number two, dracunculiass that's a good one. Yeah, this one's pretty awful too. It's all this is really sad. As the guinea worm. Yeah, this is really sad because it affects the poorest of the poor in the world. That's the bad news, because it comes from drinking un clean water. The good news is they have largely eradicated it. Well, the five countries that are stubbornly hanging on your guinea worm infection. But dude, we're talking. Um, let's go back in time to nineteen six. I'm in the tenth grade. You're an elementary school. If you're drinking behind the elementary I was in the baseball cards. I was into drinking behind the element I was into Defender in van Halen Um. So three point five million people were infected every year back then. And now let's go back a couple of years to two thousand seven when I was into Defender and Van Halen and I was drinking behind the elementary school. Yeah, that's scary. Only nine thousand five cases were reported, so that's awesome, and most of those were in the Sudan and Ghana, so clearly some work to be done there. Sure, So now we should talk about how the gross this is. This is a very very gross gross. Paris is the worst one. I think what happens is U it's generally taken up through at tainted water supply a year later. Yeah, that's what was so frightening is you drink bad water on vacation and Ghana. A year later, all of a sudden, you say, what's that blister on my foot? Well, the tour Ghana Tourism board is gonna be really mad at you. The Greater Ghanese um Chamber of Commerce is going to be after you chuck to go ahead, all right? So basically, what is it? Water fleas are easily infected with these parasites, and they show up in unsanitary water. You drink this water, you get a couple of water fleas in, or you can considerably just drink the larva. Right. Uh, the larva travel down to your intestine where they lodge. They can pass through the intestine, which most parasites can um and then they grow right. Well, the stomach acid what I thought was interesting is it does not kill. It killed the water, Thank you stomach acid. Right, So, yeah, the parasite sticks around. It grows and grows and grows um too, about two to three ft long or a hundred centimeters long um over the course of ten to fourteen months. And it's just the females that grow to this adult stage. And they said it's as wide as a cooked spaghetti noodle three ft long in your intestine. Yeah, and it's gross. That's not the worst part though. Our guest producer Lizzie is about the girl. I think we should make that our our mission today. Okay, So, um, you've got this three ft long live spaghetti noodle that you can clearly identify as a female, uh, detached from your intestine, and then it migrates to the skin. And here's where the beauty parts oil forms on the site where the worms about to emerge, and pop goes the weasel. The worms starts to poke its head out and uh. Basically you look down and you have a worm coming out of your body. And here's the tricky part, what getting it out? Okay, so if you have them picked up by now, parasites are arguably the most intelligent things on the planet, or at the very least the most tenacious. The boil or the blister where that's that occurs at the site where the worms about to emerge. Actually, the pain associated with it is alleviated simply by dropping it in water. Yeah, this is a contact with water triggers the guinea worm to release this milky white substance, which is actually millions of larva into the water supply. So the water supply is now tainted and the life cycle begins again. Right, So you're in the you're in Ghana, you're feeling bad, You get in the river because it makes it feel better, and then all of a sudden, everyone downstream is getting this milky secretion of eggs. They get infected. Just so g it is so okay again, c DC says, yeah, really, the best way to do this is to have a clean sanitary water supply. So the treatment for this is actually just preventive. You just make sure that population has a clean water supply, right, which is what the Carter Center has been working so hard for all these years. That's odd to mention the Carter Center out of nowhere. Well, no, the Carter Center they've been doing all this work. Oh they have. Yeah, since when trying to eradicate g W d Oh did they help with that drop from three point five million to less than ten thousand cases in about ten years? You got it, buddy, right, Well, way to go, Jimmy Carter. Okay, so the Carter Center is working on eradicating the guinea worm. Sure, among other groups, got you World Health Organization? Uh? Yeah, right, okay, so yes, so we've got we've got it down. But let's say that you do have a polluted water source and all of a sudden you have a three foot long cook spaghetti noodle coming out of your leg in a boil. What do you do, Chuck, what do you do? Well? One thing you can do, Josh, is you can pull it out, and you can only do this a few centimeters at a time on a daily basis. I'm glad I read this because if I ever had this, I would yank that thing and pull it out from my intestine in one long piece of spaghetti wolf. But apparently you can't do that. I imagine it would break off or something and causing infection, and you just make it mad. And you don't want to make a guinea worm. No, you're tough. So what you do is you wrap it around a piece of gauze or a small stick, a little bit at a time, every day, every day, for several weeks, for several weeks, until it's out. That's one thing you can do. Or it can be surgically removed, clearly by a trained professional. But we're talking about the poorest of the poor in the world, and they can't they don't have access to this, or you can just blow your head off. Well that's another option. Sure. Um. The big problem with guinea worm disease, or when it was a real real problem, is that, um, it is a it's a disease of poverty, but it's also a cause of poverty because if you have a three foot log cooks spaghetti noodle coming out of your leg um, you're pretty much temporarily disabled until that thing comes out. You can't farm, No, you can't take care of your children. Right, it's very sad. So it does have an economic impact. That just it's a cycleman, it makes everything even worse. It's does. But luckily again we've largely eradicated it except for Ghana and Molly is completely clear of it now and they used to have a problem with it all right, Chuck, Well, then turn off your time or again, buddy, that was a good one, I thought, so as well, are we leaving this part in where you're actually manipulating the timer? Yes, we'll find out onto tape worms, tapeworms. This one is pretty common, the big finish. Everybody knows tapeworms. There's that tapeworm diet which actually is real, is it really? We're not endorsing that. By the way, I'm just big on calorie restricted diets and knowledge. Even Chuck won't let me endorse that one. But still, uh, this is We chose this one because it's actually really interesting. Um. The study of tapeworms has revealed a change and understanding of human evolution. Big deal, or at least pitology. Yeah, we always thought humans always thought that we get tapeworms from animals. Thanks a lot, cow and pig for getting us tapeworms. There's some research that's been done that actually turns the tables, Josh, and in a switcheroo. It looks like we may have started the whole thing and given it to the animals. So not only did we domesticate you for slaughter, we also gave you the tapeworm. So tapeworms uh known affectionately in the medical community as tania. Uh. There's uh tanias solium, which we'll talk about that's distinct from Tania sagenada and Tania asiatica. Thank you. I worked on pronunciations like all day uh sagonada and asiatica both actually for their lifestyle life cycle require an herbivore in there as an intermediate host to get to their definitive host us, the carnivores carnivores. Right, does this mean a vegetarian or vegan wouldn't be infected? You would think so, but look out for tanias solium, which will get anybody. Yeah, very broad range and including dogs. It said. That's very sad, right, Yeah, once we domesticated dogs, cows, pigs, you know again, we thought that that's when we started getting tapeworms. Actually, tapeworms go back as far as about two point seven million years. Humans or hominids have had some sort of trouble um with all of the wretching and the pooping and stuff like that, if you believe that kind of thing. Yeah, we've been around for two point seven million years? Do you believe that? Hogwatch? Sorry, so, chuck um. Let's talk about tapeworms. What they do, how they do it, what they look like. All right, we're talking about intestinal tapeworm infections. A lot of times, uh, they're not detected because it's pretty mild symptom. Wize, I assume that one or both of us has a tapeworm right now? Can I tell you something? Boy? Yes, So I'm actually a big proponent of high colonics. Yeah, oh yeah, I learned so much. They are mood changing, really and you have to get to And also anyone who goes out and gets a high klonic make sure the place you go is ultra sanitized and insist on watching them sanitize the machine, especially in our producers. Jerry's House of Klonics. I mean, she's tidy, but I wouldn't accept the high klonic from her. Right, Um, I was. I got high klonic two of them. The second one it was like I was a brand new person. I literally felt reborn. But the guy who was running the place was telling me about a customer. They it's so perverse. They have this table set up and it's like a doctor's exam table um, and you have certain things sticking certain places, um, and then a tube. Dr Frankenstein going sure, you have a tube going out right, And then there's mirrors showing the whole thing, so you're seeing all the stuff. One guy had to call the owner in who was telling me the story, and he had stopped up the tube and they went and removed the tube on it out. You know what it was. It was a fist size ball of worms. You're kidding. The guy had had no symptoms, had no clue they were in there. Uh, and all of a sudden, the fist sized ball of worms coming out. Well, it's pretty clear why the Discovery show is called Monsters Inside Me. Yeah, fistful of monsters inside of you. Yeah, so high colonics equal getting rid of worms. Sometimes that's my that's my little ast side there, Chuck. I'm going to Jerry's House of clonics right after this. You should, so, Chuck, how do we get these tape worms that come out and fist size balls? Well, there's different ways, Josh. Um. It's usually you can get it through eating food. But there's uh, there's a little disturbing asset to all this is fecal matter has to be involved. Yeah. I saw in this article that you could get it through intimate contact. But if fecal matter has to be present, what is that? I don't know, And you out there in podcasts, I can't make your own call there. But if let's say you were preparing some food and um, you have poop on your hands and poop or something involved involved, yeah, then then you can get it. And I know, undercooked pork I think is one way that you can get the Uh the which one was it? The solum? No? Is it? I thought? So? No? Yeah, Solium is the only one that doesn't require a herbivore. It's the others. Solium is often found in raw or undercook pork, and it's therefore called the pork tape worm. Well that's pretty definitive. It sounds like it. Yeah, at least that's what Dr Hoburg says. It's so. One of the things I found disturbing was this. So you know how tapeworms are segmented. First of all, they can grow up to sixty twenty meters long. That's disturbing, And they're heavily segmented. Each segment can contain up to forty thousand eggs larva eggs um. These eggs can actually live twenty five years out in the open. So if you poop somewhere like in the desert at age, if you go back and visit your poop in the desert age fifty, if there were taper makes in there, you could consuerably eat them and start it over again. That's crazy, isn't that gross? That is and if you swallow these eggs, josh, uh, the larvae can actually penetrate your intestinal wall and lodge in an organ or form a cyst. Well, yeah, they can form brain cysts. They can also attach They can attach to any organ, including your eye and brain, which can cause. They've said they've linked it to blindness and epilepsy and insanity and um seizures. Yeah, what else is there? Um? Paralysis, UM, A lack of equilibrium, Yeah, like vertigo, dizziness, that kind of thing. It's bad stuff, it is, So stay away from dirty pigs and don't cook if you have poop on your hands, just get somebody else to cook an maybe go out to eat. Yeah, that's a good call. Does that it on tape worms? Yeah? We already covered the part about how it turns out we infected livestock, right, sorry pigs. So that's three uh three gross parasite Again. I want to say I want to give a shout out to my favorite which we didn't cover because there's actually a dearth of information out there on it. It's called the human bot fly, bot fly, the fly. Did you read my blog post on it? Did you watched the video? And that's awesome? So the bot fly actually doesn't sting or lay its eggs or spread its larva directly into humans. It uses um mosquitoes to do it for him. So these flies actually capture mosquito midflight, lay some eggs on it, and then the mosquito flies around with the eggs until they hatch into larva. Once the larva hatch, the mosquito um plunges its proposes into a human or any any mammal I believe in to me there in the so the larva are actually transferred. They go under the under the skin, so there and eat your fatty tissue for several weeks, and then finally a maggot emerges from your skin and falls off and goes into the soil where it burrows and until the pupa. Then that's the pupa stage, and then it emerges as an adult bot fly. That's the wrath of con Yeah, and there is no treatment for it. Also, people who have these things, they they as they grow they stay close to the surface. So if you there, it breathes through your skin, right through a hole in your skin um and if you cover it up, you can feel the maggot moving underneath your skin. People have reported was just not in the top three because there's not that much information on it, but we're still talking about it anyway, Bunny. Um. And then the the only way to get rid of it is to actually pop it out. So if you go to the blogs at how stuff works dot com you can, uh, I think you go through older posts and you find one on the bot Flight's probably a couple of weeks old by the time this this podcast comes out. And if you're into parasites or that kind of thing, well, definitely that's one thing. But while you're getting help, while you're filling out the requisite insurance forms, you should probably check out um Monsters Inside Me on Animal Planet on Wednesdays at nine and Chuck and I don't talk just anything like this is a cool show. Yeah, cool and gross and just you know, if you're into that kind of thing, and I know you are, and again that it's like you're abusing our listeners. Um. That website for Monsters Inside Me has one of the great writers on staff here at how stuffworks dot com, Robert Lamb to work by him, Robert's one of my favorite. Rocked it out. So yeah, so there you go, three gross parasites plus the bot fly, and that means it's time for listener mail. So, Josh, I'm just gonna call this listener mail from two dudes someone took you to ask on Superman, did you read those we only get too well. We had a few people right in, but I'm going I'm gonna read Thomas. It's really ultimately, Chuck, I don't. It's gotten to the point where I'm not sure why I opened my mouth unless I'm definitively sure I know what I'm talking about, because I tend to say the exact opposite of what's true. I know, but you know that's Uh, that's part of the show. You know. People like finding little tidbits that we get wrong. It's becoming the crux of the show. No, no, no, these are things, These are little tidbits. This is this is not high science here, It's about Superman for godsakes. Um, Hi, guys, have been listening to your great podcast for a while and I love them. I've never seen an email, but I felt I needed to correct something in the Earthquake podcast. You said Superman lied to Lex Luthor's girlfriend. I believe was he's test marker. Uh not true, Superman did not lie. She made him a promise. She made him promise to save her mother before stopping the missile headed for California. He reluctantly agreed, and she removed his Kryptonite necklace and flew to Hackensack, New Jersey to say, miss test Marker's mom. After he pushed the missile to space, you turned around to see the second missile hit the San Andrea's fault. So sorry, Superman did not lie, and he even says uh in his own words, lois, I never lie. It comes from Thomas from Harvard, Illinois. He's a dogmatic and inflexible. He may have toxic plasms. I think he does. And this is from Anthony. Hey, Chuckers, listen to the new podcast on twinkies. He didn't address you. I thought that was weird. Does well because they think that you don't read the listener meal when in fact you too. Yeah. I get the listener emails too, you just don't respond and read them on the air. To clear that up, Josh treats everything. Yeah, so hey Chuckers and Josh, oh, he did say that, I just missed it. Uh. Bell is a whole lot of unnecessary twinkies reminded me of a time in the early nineties when I worked at The State News, Michigan States University's independent student newspaper, Start, we had a weekly junk food cookie day when we would all chip in a buck or two, multiplied by a staff of fixed fifty or sixty, and get heaps of sugary and salty snacks. While gorging ourselves on Twinkies. We had a debate about their shelf life. We took some gaffer tape one of your favorite things. I love that, and uh stuck at two pack up on the inside of a locker, intending to leave it for as long as possible. For over three years. We watched the twinkies disintegrate into heaps of powder, but never during our experiment during did we see any mold visible. We eventually threw away the package, and I have not even from sins how it comes from Anthony? Well, Anthony, Yeah, what year did he say? He didn't Well, he said early nineties, so he was he was, he's my age. Yeah, we're grunging it out. You cried when krit Cobain died. Dues. Now, well, if like Chuck you cried when Kurt Cobain died, you can send us an email about that too. Stuff podcast at how stuff works dot com.
