Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles w Chuck Bryant and Jerry's out there wandering around in the ether and that makes this stuff. You should know. She's been wandering around the ether for weeks at least, I dare say months by not Chuck. Yeah, she's uh, actually just chatted with Jerry from ten feet away. Oh that's nice, man, that must have felt really special. Did in her hair is long? O? Man? My hair is really long too. Yeah. I feel like I saw Jerry a couple of months ago and her hair was long, So she must have like a full on like do now? Uh? Yeah, you know she looks like a proper lady. I'm not touching that one, all right, So, Chuck, this one was of yours. It was a nursing homes is the idea? Right? Yeah? So I have a question for you. What what made you decide that you want to do on nursing homes? You know, I mean, I'm almost fifty, My parents are in their mid seventies. Emily's grandmother is edging towards one so you know, this is the kind of stuff that just you gotta start thinking about at some point. And Emily and I are old parents and have an only child that we don't want her to have to like have to take care of us or anything. So like we're just starting to have all these thoughts. And I was like, yeah, you know what, I'm not so sure America does it right here. Um, And after studying this stuff, it's we do it, okay. But it's also like, hey, work your whole life and then go broke at the end. Yeah, that's that's a real bomber about the whole thing is just you're just kind of like expected to spend whatever money you have on care at the end of your life. And it just seems a little wrong to me too. Yeah, and we need to shout out first of all, our buddy Dave Ruse helped us put this together, and he actually did a real deal interview with Dr Muriel Gillick, who was an author of Old and Sick in America colon the Journey through the health Care system and was quite a resource, and that the history of this stuff in this country I think was pretty fascinating. Yeah, it is. It's super fascinating. Um, and the whole thing kind of started out. Um, you know, when we're talking about nursing homes in particular, but there's just no way we can't talk about other kinds of homes in particular, because nursing homes grew out of this kind of system that developed that seemed to really kind of take shape and take hold around the Second Industrial Revolution, the one that happened here in the States, and because of that, because people were like, you know, I don't feel like swinging the scythe any longer. I'm gonna go into town and see what they have in the way of jobs. So long mom and dad. All of a sudden, Mom and dad were like gulp, because they were on their own, not just you know, one set of parents in particular, but as like a general intergenerational trend where kids were moving away from the farm, and all of a sudden, there weren't multi generational homes like there were before. Because when you have a multigenerational home, you don't have to worry about what's going to happen to you when you get older. Where you're gonna live. You're gonna live in the same house you raised your your Brady, little kid in to take care of you until you die. And that's just the way it was for years and years and years in America. Yeah, there's a stat here. Uh In nineteen hundred, fifty seven percent of adults over sixty five lived in a multigenerational household, and by nineteen eighty eight years later, that went down to seventeen percent. And big reasons for that, Like you were talking about, you know, moving away from the farm. But just nowadays people just move away. I mean, sixty percent of American adults have moved to a completely new community at least once. And as uh Dr Gillick points out, she says, not only are people not living with their adult children, they're not even living near them many times now, Yeah, because they finally wised up and we're like, gosh, I can get away from my kids once and for all now that they're adults. Well, I think it's more like the kids are like, hey, gee, I want to go live in wherever the heck I want to and we'll just think of a plan for my parents at home. My generation doesn't have any hangups about guilt or morality, you know. But the thing is, it's not just the kids moving away. Like my grandmother moved far away. She moved to Florida, she moved to Arizona. She moved. She was like, so long, everybody, I got this UM. But she was very fortunate that she had. One of the things that UM nursing homes exist for is to take care of people who don't got it, who either don't have family, who don't have the money to hire people to take care of them, who don't have the money to go live in and you know, say like assisted living or something. UM. That's what nursing homes have kind of evolved to take care of. And in that sense, they're actually directly related to what came what were originally called alms houses or county houses or poor houses, which if you were old and you didn't have anyone to take care of you, in like the late eighteenth early nineteenth century in America, you could go to like a farm that the county maintained and there would be a bed there for you, and um, you would be housed with a bunch of different people with a bunch of different conditions, and the one thing that you all had in common was that society didn't quite know what to do with you. Yeah. So I mean it could range from people who had no living family two and just you know, needed care that had nothing else wrong with them except just being old and needing care and having no one around, uh, to people that were mentally ill, maybe people who were suffering from dementia, or people who were alcoholics or drug addicts, and like you said, they you could get a bed, but there were no doctors, there were no nurses, you couldn't get medical care. Uh. And that was sort of the the beginnings of of the shame almost if you want to look at it that way. Yeah, kind of. But it does say something that society did say, we have a responsibility of people. We can't just be like, well, there's a corn field for you to go lay in until you die of exposure, good luck, you know, Like there was a bed that was provided. As meager and horrific as that whole thing was, it was at at least an experiment or an attempt to do something. Yeah. And you know, the next big change happened, um, sort of midway through the nineteenth century when uh, sort of around the time in the Civil War, we started getting our first big hospitals like medical hospitals, public medical hospitals and the big cities around the country, and they, you know, they were sort of the the beginnings of modern um large scale public healthcare. And here's the thing, though, is they were back then they focused on acute care. So if you again were a senior and you uh they called them old chronics, like you had maybe a chronic condition and no one to take care of you, then you uh, basically you were too too dependent to go to one of these places because it was a hospital, and they're like, you can't stay here, right because even though you know you're called an old chronic, you might not have anything wrong with you aside from being really old, and maybe you can't make it to the bathroom very easily something like that, but not necessarily anything that a hospital could treat you for. It was just they had a bed about hospitals. Very quickly, we're like, we can't, like this isn't working. You're gonna stay here indefinitely and there's really nothing wrong with you. We gotta find a place for you. And so about that time, some charities, especially either ethnic or religious based charities like the um Baptists or the German Aid Society was was a big one in Boston. I think, um, the German Ladies Aid Society of Boston. I'm sorry. Um, they kind of said, you know what, we we have members who are uh they're members of our church or you know, they're German, they're part of our community and they don't have anybody, so we we need to make sure that they're taken care of. And they actually started founding what we're called old age homes, which is basically they would get like a large home and um kind of outfit it with different Each room was like a different room for a different tenant, and they would take care of like old widows basically who didn't have the money or the children to take care of them. Yeah. But specifically, what they deemed as worthy poor uh, And here's what differentiated them from the almshouses was, uh, if you were worthy poor and you know that's in air quotes, that meant that you were the wife of of a man who who worked hard all his life but never made a lot of money, maybe worked at a shipyard or just had sort of a very low paying, blue collar but respectable job, but certainly not the kind of dough to pay for like private nursing homes or anything like that, but not alcoholic or drug addict or you know, there was no UM. They didn't like force a shame attachment to it. So these widows who were you know, in their sixties or seventies, depending on you know, how their husband lived their lives, They're like, I've been morphine free since seventy three, so let me in. Uh. They didn't have these big pensions or anything because of the jobs their husbands had. So they were taken into one of these homes like a Baptist m or something, and they were given to bed and they were given again, not medical care, but they were at least given meals in a bed. Right. Um. A lot of times they were expected to kind of pay for their their room and board. Um. It was kind of like a needs based sliding scale. I got the impression some of them, UM just straight up said hey, give us five hundred dollars. At the time, I think around nine or uh, late nineteenth century, I don't remember exactly when it was, um, the Winchester Home for Aged Women in Massachusetts, the Winchester Mystery House. I looked it up. I was like, is that the same one? But it was. It was bequeathed by a Lucy Winchester, who I couldn't find anything about. But it's not the same person. A lot of people in the house, you would, um, although you gain a lot more ghosts, it's true. But um, they said, you pay us five hundred dollars. So this is in nineteen o four. You pay us five hundred dollars and you can stay here for the rest of your life. And five hundred dollars back then was worth about fifteen thousand today, And exactly I was thinking about that. It's a bit of a gamble on both sides. But it's a bit like insurance. It's like some sort of long term care um insurance where you're like, okay, let's stretch my five dollars as far as I can go, or you know, you could die two days after they still kept your five hundred dollars. But then hopefully it was used to make life better for the other people who's who had used up their five hundred dollars long ago. You know. So there was this kind of idea that if you could pay for it, you should pay for it. And then as time went on, it was like, oh, you just you know, you sold your house. We need that money if you're gonna stay here, And people would take in more and more money from that person's estate um as they were alive to take care of them. And this was starting in like the beginning of the twentieth century into the nineteenth century. So that's a very long tradition of extracting everything from old people as they're dying to to pay for their care. And I'm got you, I'm bothered by that. Yeah, I mean the question became U, not how how much is it for your care facility, and it's more like how much you got how much you got here? Graham by the ankles and turn them upside down, or if they you know, if they weren't charging. There was the expectation that they didn't need so much care that they couldn't also contribute, like here, we got a room for you. We'll feed you, but you gotta make your bed, and you gotta clean your room and maybe help keep the property up. So I got the idea that these were people who, like I said, you know, a senior widow who just didn't have anywhere else to go and otherwise was doing okay, yeah, but forced to make knockoff Gucci wallets during craft arts and craft. Should we take a break? All right, I got a Gucci wallet to work on myself. Okay, So we've got alms houses are still around. They have they stayed around until like the nineteen forties. From what I could see, these county houses poor houses, um, and then alongside of those you've got old age homes. But then, um, the government was kind of like, we can do we can do better than this. New York itself, I think, became the first state in the United States to say, um, it's a ten ninety it's modern era, we need to do more to take care of like our our elderly and in particular are mentally infirm. Um. They and they that state made a commitment to take care for the state, to take responsibility for its mentally ill and that included people with dementia of all sorts, which they would have called senility back then. Um. And so that was kind of like the first entree of the state into caring for elderly people. And that actually kind of opened a bit of a floodgate. I think, um. Other states started to kind of follow suit, but it was like a it was a step in a really dark direction, because by World War One, if you were elderly, especially if you had some sort of um declined, some sort of cognitive decline from age, there was a really good chance that you were in a mental asylum um with everybody else. And in a lot of cases, I think even if you were just elderly, you would find yourself in a mental asylum in that right, Yeah, I mean absolutely. So you've got a situation where the states start to say, hey, we need to take care of our mentally ill, but seniors just started getting kind of lumped in if they didn't have anywhere else to go. So you might have you know, someone's someone's grandmother who just didn't have family and who was really doing okay upstairs and and was in pretty good health, might find themselves in, like you said, a mental hospital with people with severe mental illness. Uh. And I think there's a couple of stats here that Dave dug up by there were more elderly Americans and mental hospitals than in those almhouses and the price that old age homes combined. And he mentioned one in particular, Chicago State Hospital, which was a mental hospital in the nineteen thirties, of the patients there were quote aged or infirm that had no other underlying psychosis or mental health condition. Right. So that's a really dangerous place for old people to be because if you act up, they can put you on medications, they can give you, um, the hydrotherapy treatment, they can do all sorts of stuff to you because you're in a mental hospital. And I think it's kind of like one of those things where, um, if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Well, if you're a nineteen thirties old timing psychiatrist, everything looks like a um, a mental condition, a mental condition, right, you know, um, and you're gonna treat all of the people the same way. And so luckily Francis Perkins arrived on the scene around this time. So World War One is when old people really started to get shuffled off to mental hospitals by the government. Swoop James like, whoa, whoa, this is way wrong, Like we need just because these people are old doesn't mean that they're um, they're mentally ill. So let's extract them from that environment and figure out if we can do something else. And thanks to Social Security that that really began to change. Fairly quickly. Yeah, so this is nineteen thirty five. Again, you mentioned the great Francis Perkins. If you didn't listen to that episode, go listen to it. It's fantastic out the Social Security Act. Um. Basically like when we think of Social Security now, we think of the program where you pay in your whole life from your paycheck and then when you retired you get a monthly income and if you work longer than your checks are gonna be bigger. Um. I started working when I was thirteen, so imagine I'm gonna be rolling in dough. You're always boasting about that of hearing about that about my thirteen year old bus boy job. Yes, it's a title Max. Now, by the way, yeah dry Max, got your money, your mind, real money. Oh man, that's some good free advertising. Yeah. I drove. I drive by there on the way to my mom's and Emily's parents house sometimes, and I always pointed out to my daughter and say, hey, that's the barbecue restaurant I worked at. It's now a title Max. Is that the one where the guy put his foot in the Brunswick sto? Yeah? God, I wonder where that guy is now. Randy, he's in he's in I don't know. I'm not even going to guess the feeling Randy's in prison, do you think so? I mean, he saw him do a lot worse than put his foot in the Brunswicks, do you know what I mean? Oh jeez, I don't put My mind is rased at life behind bars and I'm not laughing at that. It's it's very sad. But Randy, you know, he made his own decisions. That reminds remember Randy the hippie from MTV and like the late eighties, early nineties, No, he ran for president. He was like just this total weirdo burnout who was yeah, who looked today like he could have been in l m f A. Oh okay, Like really he dressed like that, but this is like decades before. But anyway, I remember like he he like ran for president and I think he lost and he's like, I've made my bed now I must lie in it. I'll never forget that. For some reason, I thought it was hilarious. But yeah, that was Randy. Well, I mean maybe it was d Randy Brunswich, it was the Rands. What I'm saying, um, so, yeah, that that was old age insurance is what they called it originally. But then there was also Old Age Assistance oh a A, which was you're gonna get payments when you're older, even if you didn't work, which was a big deal because so many women were not allowed to work and have jobs, so like what were they going to do? They're like, say, hey, you didn't pay anything in sorry, you just raised your kids and grandkids. That's a great that's a great point. I think we still do that today though, unfortunately, but at least women can actually work in the workforce if they want to. But yeah, if they if they stay home and raise kids, then they're still treated the same way, which is pretty shameful. But I get your point. And the point is is that we needed to be able to UM take care of people who hadn't necessarily worked in the workforce and paid into Social Security, and then also we had to offset that first basically generation that we're like, Okay, we're the first ones nobody's been paying in, but why do we Why are we the ones who have to pay him but we get nothing from it? So the Old Age Assistance the o a A really helped with that UM and I guess that's kind of gone the way of disco because the only thing I know about is the Old Age insurance that's still around, and I know they don't call it that any longer, but that Old Age assistance where it's like, I guess that would be Medicaid, right, yeah, I think so okay, So so we'll and we'll talk a lot more about Medicaid and medicare. Just put a button in that all of you bureaucrat walks. You're gonna love it. Yeah, but uh, you know, FDR, this is when things really changed. And the reason we're talking about social security and stuff like this is because it really it's sort of laid out the roadmap for what was going to happen and how we cared for our grandparents and what kind of places they were going to be. So because he went in there with a new deal and he was like these all houses are terrible. He's like, we need to get rid of these. And he said in these state mental hospitals, they're overburdened. And that's not right either. So here's what I'll do. Part of the o A A the Old Age Assistants. A big provision here is that you can't um you can't get any of that money if you're living in a public institution like an alms house or like a state mental hospital, No money come in your way. No. So suddenly the people who were stuck in state mental hospitals or alms houses not only were like, oh, well I could get out of here. Now I have the funds to get out of here and go somewhere better. And this led to a huge boom in the growth of private um uh living facilities for the elderly. Yeah. I think that was the big change. I mean, surely people were like, great, I can get out of here, but I think people saw dollar signs said wait a minute, I can get paid by the government to take in these people and take care of them, right, sometimes directly get paid by the government. Yeah. That was kind of like an amendment that they made later on where it was like, um yeah, that that incentivized it even more. It's like, well, we'll pay you directly. There's not even this person as gonna have to be involved. Just take care of them, you know, follow these guidelines and we'll send you this check every month. And the people is there any money left over for me? You know? And no, no, no, no, this just don't ask any questions. It's as a matter of fact, now that you bring it up, do you have any money, you're gonna give it to them first before we give you. There's a balance on your account, sir. So. Um, this is kind of how it went for like the first you know, fifteen twenty years after so Security Act was introduced in nineteen thirty five, where um it fueled this boom of retirement homes. Basically the retirement home into Tree found its its birth there. And then about fifteen years after the government was like, you know what, we've been sinking a lot of money into this, maybe we should look around and see if any of these places are any good. And they found that no, in a lot of cases they weren't really good. There was, um, you know, if you if you converted an old Victorian mansion into an old age home with a dozen rooms, you probably didn't add a fire exit onto every room and fire stairs on the second and third floor. Um, there's probably not sprinkler system because they weren't very prevalent by that time, and so if there was a fire, all of these uh, the dozen ages and infirm people who lived there were going to die in a fire. Um that was the one big one that they turned up that came out of these early investigations into into what came to be called nursing homes. Yeah, so this is when Congress steps in again, like you said, about fifteen to twenty years later in the nineteen fifties, and said, all right, here's the deal. If you're getting this dough from us, we need to regulate, um, what's going on there, and they need to be safe. And a lot of these mom and pops that, like you said, converted an old house, they couldn't make those upgrades. You can't just slap on a fire escaped to an old Victorian. I guess you could, but it wouldn't look that great or probably work that well. And so a lot of these smaller ones floundered and all of a sudden, and this is things where things really start to change. There's a big market for just basically I don't even know if I would call it the corporatization yet, but maybe to a certain degree, these bigger facilities for residents that had this money that could go straight to them. And uh so these sort of larger places that weren't individual houses started popping up. Yeah, well, that's like an ongoing and recurring theme in a big criticism among conservatives of big government or government regulation is that it homogenizes things because usually the mom and pop operations, even if they are well meaning and not nefarious, like they don't have money to add those fire exits on. But say like a corporation that's going to own several of these things, they can build new ones with all the modern fire exits and fire sprinklers. And so those bigger corporations start owning more and more and more, and by building more and more and more, they're not gonna make each one like really unique and and embedded in the community. They're going to plunk down the same one in every place they build one. And so there's this homogenization that occurs as a result of that. And that's exactly what happened with what came to be called nursing homes, which really started to find their advent in the nineteen fifties from these reforms where the government was like, you guys need to be able to do this, this, and this, um, we're gonna assign the Public Health Service to to lay out guidelines. The Public Health Service knows about regulating hospitals, so they really added onto that homogenization, this this underlying medicalization of caring for older people, which makes sense. You know, you think of older people, olderally people, senior adult you think, gosh, the you know, the body is starting to wear down. There have they have all these conditions or whatever, So it makes sense that you a couple hospitalization or medicalization with that. But that's not always the case. And the problem is, as it became the case, whether you needed it or not, that was the kind of place you lived was basically a bland institutional extension of a hospital. Yeah, I mean it's not like in Uh. I kept thinking of the movie Say Anything when I was researching this because that was a prominent storyline in that movie. I never saw it. You never saw Say Anything. I didn't do you wonder what happens every time a guy in a trench coat holds up a boom box over his head. So, I mean, I know you need the cultural reference. Yeah, of course, I just wondered up all this time. You're like, what is the deal with this boom box? Yeah, it's like a reference to Kevin Smith and Clark. Okay, sure, exactly now Ione Sky's father, the late great John Mahoney. Was he ran a mom and pop nursing home. Yes, and was in spoiler coming if you haven't seen a thirty something year old movie. Uh, he was found to be ripping them off and that was a big sort of subplot in that movie. All I heard was that was a big subplot in that movie. Very good, but uh, say anything aside. They um, like you said, became more hospitalized for lack of a better word, And if you went to one of them back then, there was very little to differentiate it from a hospital, from the central nurses station to the cafeteria food. I remember going to visit my my grandmother on my my paternal grandmother, who lived to be a hundred and one before my dad and his wife took her in. She was in one of these places and uh, or actually maybe it was the other way around. She went afterward. But it was it was terrible, you know, it was awful and very very sad. And if I was not a young man with nothing, you know, nothing going on in my life, I might have done something about it, but you know, I didn't know what to do back then. You would have opened all the doors and been like, go free, go free. I would have ripped her out of there at least and said come home with me. Yeah, I mean they were pretty bad, especially by the time I'm guessing you were there in the eighties or nineties. Maybe this was in would have been the nineties. Yeah, So in the fifties, in the mid fifties, even these things made a little more sense at the very least they were newer. By the seventies and eighties, they were so bad that we had a reform Act that kicked in seven, which is basically like this place is wrong, and like maybe we don't know what to do or replace him with, but here are some things that that you have to treat these people with, like dignity. They have to be able to have a say in what they wear or what they um, what they eat, or what they do during the day. And it really kind of got off the rails within a couple of decades after their advent. The thing is is like I was saying, nobody knows what to do about nursing homes, and we'll talk a little more about that later, but just just kind of put a pin in that nursing homes were not not great, and they're still not great. Yeah, should we take a break and then come back and talk about medicaid and medicare and how that figures in. Yeah, all right, Well we'll be right back with those two tiny little things right after this. Alright, So we promised talk of Medicare and medicaid, and I think Dave kind of put it really on the nose here he said no to government programs have shaped a nursing home care model over the last fifty years more than than those two programs. UH. Created in nineteen Lyndon Johnson amended the Social Security Act. And UH, if you still get confused, if you're like a young hip and heppen and millennial and you don't know what those two words mean and you get them mixed up. Medicare is health insurance universal, one might dare say socialized medicine. That's a red herring for Americans over sixty five. Medicaid is long term care for Americans lower income status. That's right, Yeah, and it can. You don't necessarily have to be elderly for um Medicaid. I believe. Yeah, Medicare, you do Medicaid. You could be lower income and have a lifelong disability and you'd be eligible for Medicaid too. Yeah, so Medicare again, this is if you're over sixty five, it's gonna pay for acute medical care when you're in a hospital. But if you need something long term UM kind of like what we're talking about at the beginning, then uh, it won't pay for that. Like you can't just say all right, I'm gonna go to a nursing home now and it's gonna just pay for that in full, but Medicaid would. And for a while everybody's like, okay, well, we'll just take Medicaid. This is UM after Lyndon Johnson's Great Society in UM. So they were like, this is fine. And then somebody realized that Medicare pays way more than Medicaid does, and so all of the bottom line people said, how can we can we do this? What are we gonna do? So they read the the act um and they found that, uh, there was language in there that says Medicare will pay for uh stay up to a hundred days in a skilled nursing facility UM after three days or more of treatment in the hospital. And so all of those nursing homes were like, well, we have we have nurses, we have doctors. Well, let's just rebrand ourselves as skilled nursing facilities. And so there was a huge, massive transition from nursing homes where you would go live potentially the rest of your life and there were not nurses and doctors and all of that. Um, and this was your new home until you died. To you guys got to go because we're now a skilled nursing facility, which means the most you could stay as a hundred days, but we're gonna make way more off of flipping people every hundred days than we would because Medicare is gonna pay then we would letting you stay here as a nursing home because Medicaids paying for that. That, like I said, just caused a huge change in the industry. Yeah, and Americans, uh in the eighties and nineties, UM, generally we're like, you know what, we need better um facilities and more comfortable facilities that feel more like uh, feel less like a hospital and more like an apartment, let's say. And that was sort of the birth of what's known now as assisted living facilities, where they're different levels of care that you can pay for um. And the idea is that if you go to one of those, you have a little bit more independence. Um, you have a little bit more uh say, and like how your day goes, um like and that's just at a just like a daily schedule level. Um. And you know that it's like a little more social like it it's it's sort of like you what you I mean. The best ones are like what you would hope they would be, which is a place for your grandparents to go hang out and hang out with other seniors who and and you know, have a social life and tell stories and be with one another and not just sort of be in a hospital room. Right, So, like if you can't just stay in your house or something as you're getting older, this is a real alternative for you. Um. And because there's different levels of care, you can age in place there, like you can just keep getting older and older and then they'll start, you know, adding greater and greater layers of care. The thing is is assisted living is expensive and it's outside of the federal purview. Like the Feds went all in on nursing homes. They regulate nursing homes, they don't regulate assisted care. Um. They they will pay for nursing homes, they won't pay for assisted care. Um, there's a lot of differences, and they're almost they're they're very much intertwined nursing homes and assisted living, but um, they're very they're very separate as far as the US government is considered. There are two different things, and the government recognizes nursing homes. Um. The thing is, it's like you were saying, in the eighties and nineties, people were like, we we don't want to live in nursing homes anymore, we want to move over here. And all the nursing homes were like, fine, we're skilled nursing facilities now, and we can get some of that sweet sweet medicare money. So if you did you see that stat Yeah, sixty three there were five hundred and seventy thousand skilled nursing beds into there were one point two millions. So they definitely were like, oh, that that money needs to become in our way exactly so, and that's exactly what they did. They said, you know, we're we're skilled nursing facilities now, and you know they probably are owned by the hospitals where you do three days in there and then get moved to the skilled nursing facility and then maybe if it's a large enough group, they might own an assisted living facility to that you can say move into after that hundred days or something. Um. The thing is is the assisted living is great. Um. It can be really really good, and nursing homes can be good too. There's not like all nursing homes aren't bad, and they all of them have like their their upsides. Like you were saying, assisted living is very social. There's probably you know, a lot more going on, a lot more activity, just because a lot of the people who live there these days are going to be more active still, whereas in nursing homes. It's now the people who live in nursing homes tend to be much sicker, more infirm. Um, But there's still socialization where there's not necessarily if you just you know, live alone your house and somebody comes by a couple of times a week. So there are definitely good things to nursing homes. The problem is is se of them are for profit. Some of them are owned by um private equity firms. We shouldn't let private private equity firms anywhere near the aged population. Ever in any country. That's just a terrible combination. And apparently, in fact, their studies that show when private equity firms take over nursing homes there is a measurable decline in health outcomes for the residents because their whole thing is there they you know, they're dedicated to making you know, corporate profits, and so you've cut costs and you cut services, and you just approach things differently than you should. And that's kind of like this evolution that's going on now, is we we've been providing services to elderly people as they age, as if their customers where instead we should be providing care. And those are two different things. Even though from you know, a few paces back they might look similar, they're not. They're different. And that's kind of the push that we're going toward now. Yeah, So where we find ourselves today statistically is uh. And I was kind of surprised about this. I had a feeling that more Americans were in these facilities than I thought. Um, I guess it's a little bit heartening to hear the numbers. Um, there are about one point four million Americans in residential nursing homes and then another one point seven million cycling through those skilled nursing nursing facilities if they have like a surgery or an illness or something they're recovering from or rehabbing from, which is only about four point five percent of all Americans over sixty five and ten of all Americans over eighty five. I thought it would be higher than that. Um, you know, if you want to look at the downside, though, is one big reason why. Maybe the cost um It depends on where you are, of course, but if you um are in a private room at a nursing home, and I guess was this in Georgia, Yeah, two hundred and thirty five dollars a night in New York, that's about four hundred dollars a night and change on average a night like at that point, just move them into the w Hotel, right, pretty pretty much. Yeah. The only thing is that they don't have nurses at the the W Hunt. But that's a lot of money, man, And you can just get bled dry at the end of your life. Well you do. And as a matter of fact, to pay four a place like that a nursing home, Medicaid says you have to have paid in which basically says, you need to have if you if you don't own your house anymore, you have to um give the proceeds from your house. Um. Yeah, you have to liquidate your your your inheritance, you have to you have to pay down to usually something like I saw like maybe seven hundred dollars a month income is the cut off. Anything over that, and you have to be contributing. Um. Anything under that, the Medicaid will kick in and pay the place directly for letting you stay there. Um. But the thing is, it's like, of course, the the better alternative is assisted living. Some state Medicaid programs will pay or help pay for assisted living. But for the most part, if you're if you are paying for if you're living in an assisted living facility, you might have a reverse mortgage on your house. You are probably you've liquidated all of your um, your investments. Um, you're you're you're paying for it out of pocket. In the United States for the good kind of retirement home. Yeah, and you know there are people out there that are trying to further reform uh what these places look like. Uh. There's a gentleman named Dr Bill Thomas, who is a geriatrician who has something called the Eden Alternative. Um. That is he's trying to basically reframe these nursing home uh residents in caregivers as care partners. And you know it sounds kind of hippie dippy, but um, he wants people to be able to still grow in life and to still flourish and to still learn. Um, just because you're a senior doesn't mean you just have to to sit in a room and watch Judge Judy or push checkers around a checkerboard. Uh. And you know that they're depending on where you are, they might be adopting these methodologies of the Eden Alternative or UM the greenhouse movement. Another thing he helps spawn, which is you're in an in an individualized home. It's not a big facility. You got a private room, you've got a bathroom, and there's outdoor space for you to go and garden and to walk around and to again try and flourish in your in your last years on this planet. Right. Um. And that's a that's there's also a push for um for aging in place at home. Yeah sure, which can be really been official, but again it can also be isolating, depending on you know what kind of friends or family maybe if you live in a condo it would be a little more. But if you're living in the house that you spent your entire life in and all the neighbors have moved away and you don't know anybody anymore, that can be isolating. So in that sense, assisted living or even a nursing home could be a better alternative. But a lot of people say, no, this is my house, I want to stay here at home. The problem is is um I've seen I've seen it put that medicaid has an institutional bias, which means that like they'll pay for you to go to a institution like the definition of the word institution, they don't really pay for you to be able to stay at home. Some programs do, but a lot of them don't, even if you do want to stay at home, which is kind of heartbreaking to me. Yeah, I mean, you know Emily's grandmother Mary, who was very popular with the stuff. You should know Army as the eldest general. She you know, we had to move her out of her house that she was in, you know, not our whole life, but for a large portion of of her life. But you know, it was one of those deals where it's out in the middle of the country in Ohio. Uh, there was no family close by, there was no hospital close by, and it's just it's hard to say it's okay to stay there, you know. Um. And it was sad when she left, but she was also like, no, this is great, I'll move in with you guys. Like she didn't kick and scream, you know, she was she was willing and understood it was the best thing. And uh, you know, it's probably one reason why she's pushing one right now. I think for sure where she live, she lives with Emily's parents and here in Georgia. Now that's great. Yeah, um, well, I'm yeah, I'm I'm very glad that that worked out for um. But I was also looking at like the antithesis of that, like what happens in the United States to people who who don't have any family, who don't have any children, and who don't have any money, like what happens to them, And they seemed to be they seem to be kind of left on their own, Like if they have a house, they're they're probably just to be left in their house and maybe meals on wheels will come by. Um. The County Social Services might be able to help them. But this is if they reach out for help, if they need assistance, they might not get it at home because again, there's a lot of UM services that aren't paid for. And if you don't I mean money, you're s o l. You could go to a UM uh nursing home. But if you don't have any ability to pay UM, they can kick you out. Uh, they can kick you out for a bunch of different reasons. They're The most oppressing thing that I've looked up in a while was nursing home evictions, and they there are there's a there was a loophole that was recently closed in two thousand sixteen that said UM, if you if the nursing home is not able to UM to offer care for the person, then they can be discharged. And they use that as like a huge loophole. They'd be like, we're sorry, we can't offer you the care you need any longer. You have to leave. And you know, if you don't have anybody to advocate for you, you're you're you know, where are you going to go? And I couldn't get a really good answer, but I get the impression that it's there are it's not huge and rampant, but there are a lot of people who are still falling through the crack society as they age because we don't have a robust, nationalized UM plan to care for the elderly no matter what. And I thought, well, of course the United States is super behind in that respect, but apparently we're in line with other countries like Canada. You think Canada would have like a place for every senior and they're all happy and taking care of and everybody gets a pet beaver or something like that. Now you're on your own, kind of like your state might help you out a little bit, the local city might, but that's about it. Same with the UK too, which I was really surprised because both of them have nationalized medicine. Yeah. I will say that this is where UM. Social media has been beneficial UM as far as neighborhood and neighbors go UM. I mean all the time on our neighborhood pages, we see people stepping up, and especially in a place like Atlanta, Atlanta, where gentrification has happened, UM, you do see a lot of neighbors stepping up to help take care of UM, the senior African American community that is um, still living in their houses and they haven't been bought out for a shamefully low price by a greedy contractor to to flip it into a little McMansion. But you see it all the time that we work with a group called Neighbor in Need that really does great things. And aside from just the the official organizations. All the time you'll see someone that lives next door to someone like that. They'll be like, hey, she's having a hard time paying her power bill this winter, and you know, in an hour it is funded for for the rest of the year. Uh, the neighbors step up and and pay for her power bill. And it's just it's little things like that. But um, these are in unities where the houses are close together and people are you know, each other's business, like um, Emily's grandmother out there in the middle of the country, and a lot of rural America like that might not be the case. You might not have someone checking up on you, and people you know bleeding hearts like you, and I feel that they should be taking care of no matter what. You know. Yeah, but I mean, isn't that something everybody can get behind? You would think so, But that's just not true. I'll remind you of our episode on homelessness many years ago. Yeah, that one's tough for me to swallow. Those are the people who believed in the unworthy poor. Huh, and we're to send him to alms houses back in the day. Yeah. Um. The good news is if you're looking for a home for a family member these days, Medicare dot gov has a lot of resources. Oh, I'll tell you another place to u S News and World Report is really hot and heavy on um an assisted living in nursing home ratings. Yeah, nursing home compares another website. And you know there are places where you can go to really dig in see which ones you feel are a good fit. Uh. They're rated on you know, how the people are really doing. They're not just like how pretty it is. And if you go and visit one, they said to be aware of the chandelier effect. Like in fact, if you walk in and you see a grand piano and a lobby, just turn around and leave. Well yeah, that's I mean, that's one of the ways that they get you. You want to do a little more digging than just that, and you want to talk to residents, You want to read like actual like, uh, inspections and reports on those places. You want to look at stats like how many patients had to get were taken to the e er or were readmitted in the hospital, how many have bed sores? Um any allegations of abuse. Apparently abuse has doubled between two thousand thirteen and two thousand seventeen. Still low. I think it was like eight hundred and forty five, which is too many, but it's still doubled since two thousand thirteen. So you want to like really look for that kind of thing. Are they over prescribing medications like for psychosis to to people who are um who are problematic when you don't really think they're problematic. There's a lot of stuff you want to look for that you can look for. It's out there. Just do some digging because this is somebody you care about, don't forget. Yeah, and we really want to point out that, uh, it's easy to zero in on things like abuse cases and unnecessary medication. But UM, we really salute you if you are the lion share of these people, UM that are in nurses that are taking care of our seniors and doing a great, great job and a very very tough job. Yeah, and one of the things actually I saw I'm glad you said that was that, um, it's it's a really a thankless kind of job because traditionally people who work in elder care, like the actual workers are treated like garbage by management. It's just like an industry wide problem. And that was actually one of those things from the the Eden alternative was that workers are treated with the respect that you want the workers to treat the patients with like everyone is treated with respecting dignity, not just ideally the patients, the workers too, because they deserve it for the work they're doing. It's amazing. Ah, you got anything else about nursing homes, I've got nothing else. We can do. Better start thinking about stuff, you know. I mean, you're never too young to get a plan in places. That's all I'm saying. Great point, um, And since I say great point, it's time for a listener, man. I mean, maybe if you're like twenty five, you don't need to be thinking about your nursing home options. Okay, but you know what I mean, well, not necessarily, I'm your parents. I saw that of nursing home residents were under sixty five, so there are some younger residents in there that I think get overlooked a lot, like by us. You know what you call those people? What the party crowd? That's right, Oh, that's gonna be me. Man. What the party crowd at the at the nursing home. I'm be mixing it up like scat Man Cruthers in the Twilight Zone movie. I could see that. Let's go play kick the can. Everyone. It's midnight. It's time. It's time to take off that gown and live. Good things happen. You're ready, I'm ready, Well, bread away. I'm gonna call this one. Uh goots follow up? Okay, this is a good one about the great, great Steve Guttenberg. I'm hoping someone throws the stuff his way, by the way he needs he needs to know. I can feel him right now listening to all right this from Dave. Hey, guys, on a recent episode, you discuss the episode of Party Down which the wonderful Steve Guttenberg allows the caters to throw a party at his house. You knew this had come up before and wondered in what episode in what context. By chance, the next day, I was scrolling randomly through older episodes and selected Barefoot running uh boy, remember that one. When in this episode you started talking about Steve Guttenberg, I had an intensely existential experience. I was listen thing in the present to you talk about Steve Gutenberg in the past, having listened in the more recent past to you also for more from a more recent past talk about Steve Gutenberg, unable to remember the more distant past, and which you were talking about Steve Gutenberg, which I was now listening to in the present, which knowledge of the future, in which you would again discussed Steve Gutenberg. Steve Gutenberg the center of our cosmos, the nexus around which space and time and God swirl until they've become one. The answer to this question for which our souls cry out, I can only speculate yes. Anyway, I wanted to let you guys know in which previous episode he featured Steve Gutenberg. As to the context, there was none. You you started talking about Steve Gutenberg for no discernible reason. It sounds like me, which is as it should be, and that is from Dave. And Dave was very excited that this was getting read, and he said, to be honest, I had a little bit to drink when I wrote that, and I didn't fully remember the whole experience, so good job there go. This would be proud. Yeah, I think Dave's going to be part of the mixing it up crowd at the nursing home to kicking that can you know, Well, thanks a lot, Dave. That was pretty great. Um. And if you have something great to tell us, especially if it's in reference to something we said about something we said in the past, we'd love to hear from you.
