Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant and this is Stuff you should Know the podcast. Oh yeah, Jerry's over there. She's all laughy today for some reason. The salty dog. Why did salty calling someone salty? I wonder where that came from. I meant to look that up. It's someone I didn't look up because you know, you're in a salty nod. Yeah, I've said that plenty uh and once that comes from like a salty dog. Here's here, this is this is my idea. Okay, so salty described somebody who is a little coarse, a little rough around the edges, a little upset. Hear me out because their faces usually puckered into like a a sour puss face. And what makes your face pucker eating salt. So there's a salty person, okay, I would call them lemony. Well, so take something with a grain of salt. Actually ancient that's from the romans Um. They would take poison with a grain of salt, or's something that was hard to swallow with a grain of salt to make it go down more easily. Okay, somebody not being worth their salt. In this article it says that um slaves were traded with salt, and if you got your hands on like a slave, that wasn't worth much Like that, he wasn't worth his salt. Is that not the origin I found? The first reference in print came from an eighteen oh five description or book about an expedition to Guinea Bissau, and it mentions a guy who wasn't worth his salt. He's a good man, Peter Hale h a y eli um, but he wasn't worth his salt, the guy said. And I looked it up and I couldn't find that whether Hale was hired or was a slave. But I got the impression that, Um, what the guy was talking about wasn't that he had traded salt for hail, but not worth the salt like in his body. No, he was not worth the salt, meaning a salary, which supposedly salary is rooted in the idea of paying someone in salt, same with soldiers salt dre and to give salt salad to The word salad comes from the word salt, so salt is a it's a it's an important thing. Historically speaking, there's been economies largely based on salt. There have been um cultures rated by other cultures because of salt. Um. If you were an ancient salt producing area, probably the rulers control with the tight grip um that salt production and salt distribution um. And that actually carried on into the modern age when the when Great Britain was occupying India, they had a tight control on salt production there um. And actually Gandhi started a revolution or helped along the revolution to overthrow British imperial power through a salt protest. He walked two hundred and forty miles to the coast where the salt production facilities were and grabbed a bit of salty clay and boiled it, boiled the salt out of it, which was an illegal act, and that protests spurred other similar protests, and the British were like, oh, hey, you can't do that, mate, you can't mind your own salt. But he did because he was Gandhi. It was called the Salt March to Dandhi by gand by Gandhi. Uh yeah. Salt dates back to sixty b C. And they actually found evidence of salt trading in prehistoric times. So obviously it's used to spice food is great, but it's used to preserve food. Was super able, yeah back in the day and still today, because salt is one of these things. You remember, Nature loves homeostasis, it loves balance. If you introduce salt to the mix, it kind of throws off that balance. So to gain homeostasis, salt is introduced into say meat. It likes to go into the meat, but it also draws out the moisture, whether it's blood, water, whatever, so it dries out the meat. It introduces the salt and it draws out the moisture. That's right. That's called curing, which preserves things because anytime bacteria comes in contact with that salty meat, from that point on, the bacteria boom gets dried out and dies. Yeah, that's why packaged foods are still loaded with sodium. Unfortunately, I got some stuff on that later. But it was used as a currency in Ethiopia up until the twentieth century, and was used as a form of suicide in China for nobility. They would o d on salt and kill themselves. Oh yeah, because it was expensive and very valuable. So nobility, that's like, it was like a noble way to go out. And we'll talk in a minute, like what happens when you have too much salt? It's not very pleasant. It's not very pleasant. But you know in medieval Europe, remember we did the ten medieval torture devices this episode, well we skipped one called the goats tongue, and it was apparently a real thing, a tickle torture. They would dip your feet, bringing a goat, and the goat would lick the bottom of your feet and then they would dip it again. And from that in the description, no, I'm saying like it wasn't in there. Um from the description, apparently being tortured tickle tortured was not pleasant. I would love to have my feet looked by a goat. They would do it until you did not love it. That was the point of the goats tongue to it. Sounds like fun to me. Uh. And the Middle Ages, salt was transported along the notorious Old Salt Route and northern Germany. I know what I'm gonna get you for Christmas, now, a go in some salt water. I've had both at the same time. I don't know, I didn't think about it. Uh, it was played this big role in early America as well. Yeah, Massachusetts Bay Colony had the first pattern to produce salt here in the colonies, saltwater, and uh they did so for two hundred years. Uh. The Erie Canal opened primarily to transport salt. Yeah, they called it the ditch that salt built. It sounds like something you just made up. No, I swear I've been on the Erie Canal. Oh. Yeah, yeah, they have this nice system of locks, and um, they used to there's still like donkey trails from where the donkeys used to pull these little flat bottom boats that would carry salt and whatnot. And now yuppies walk along those trails. Dog yuppies. A they're still yuppies. Oh yeah, thanks, Yeah, I heard one the other day. Uh, dual income large dog owner. All right. And the early salt was apparently four times expensive as beef because salt was valuable obviously, and we were allows you with beef. And in Civil War salt played a big part in the Union strategy. Um, there were quite a few battles fault over capturing salt works and salt mines. Yeah, in Saltville, Virginia. Yeah, I wonder what they do there. And it actually had a big effect on the salt shortage on the Confederate troops. Yeah, not just the troops, but the people behind the lines back in the Confederate States were like, we want our salt, and they had a huge impact on morale apparently, I would say so. And the reason why salt is so important. If you haven't gotten the impression that it is important by now, you should rewind the podcast and just listen to the last several minutes over again. Yeah, salt is extraordinarily important because the human body requires it. It's something that we need to survive and to live, so much so that we actually have a taste sense for it. It's the only you don't need better to live, or sour or umami. As a matter of fact, things like bitter and sour are there. I think to detect things that we shouldn't be eating. Salt is to detect something we need that's right and we can. Actually, this is so mind blowing to me. I love the human body. I think it's amazingly wonderful in ways that we don't even fully understand yet. But consider this. When you need salt, your body produces a craving in you for salt that is awesome. Like I'm one of those believers. I I don't follow it necessarily myself, but in a diet, well, no thing, But in a diet where you just eat what you crave, I think you can go off the rails because I think that we uh have the wrong things now. Yes, now, but if you could go back a hundred fifty years, maybe I would bet you could survive pretty easily and thrive on a diet where you were just kind of led by your cravings, like oh it need some megs and eat a couple of eggs, steak. You don't know. You should pay attention to yourself, listen to what your body is telling you, and I'll bet you find that you do have specific cravings for specific moods, foods that are like very simple meat like chuck go eat a steak, Chuck go eat some eggs, like things that are basic staples. I'll bet you'll notice you have cravings salt. Uh. Let's let's break it down chemically. Um it's sodium and chlorine are the two basic elements, and salt. I think we all know this, which are electrolytes. That's right, and we'll get into that in a minute. Um, sodium is silvery white metal, and it is neither one of these are like super friendly independently of one another. No, you know, like especially chlorine. Yeah, sodium reacts violently if you mix it with water and oxidizes in air. Chlorine exists in gas at a room temperature. They're both really volatile. But when you put them together and you have sodium chloride, they make beautiful music, makes beautiful halite, uh, and beautiful music. And sodium chloride is is about a sixty sodium to chloride, by the way, is that right? Yeah? It makes little cubes, right, Yeah? Is it? The molecules are cubicle, right. The sodium packs in pretty tight, and then the chlorine fills in the rest and they make tiny little cubes. It's actually reversed, That's what I said. Yeah, the chloride is packed and then the sodium fills in. But you know, I would have thought the sodium was bigger. Oh well, Um, will you have is an A C L. That's right? And you mentioned electrolytes. Those are minerals that conduct electricity in our body and our fluids and tissues, which is very important important as muscle movement, we run on electricity. Heart involuntary muscle UM moves through electrical impulse. I guess all muscles do. Yeah, you want your eyes to blank, buddy? Yeah, eat some salt, right, And so there's two conditions that you can have conceivably well three, three would be just all the systems are normal. But um, the other two is too little salt and too much salt. And too little salt is called hypoon atrema. Yeah, that's what that lady died of the hold your WI for a week contest? Oh is that right? Yeah? You can o d on water, and I guess that's what you would ultimately die from. Is hypone tremea their water toxicity. Um, if you have too much water, you probably have too little salt, because water flush is salt from your system is the method that your kidneys use to maintain the balance of salt and other electrolytes in your body. And that's why you might drink gatorade if you're working out, because it has electrolytes in it, right, exactly. You don't want to water your crop land with it, though, as we found from the movie Idiocracy. Yeah, and actually found too that in the nineteen eighties there was a lot of controversy over salting roads killing roadside vegetation. Well, yeah, for sure. I mean like that, if you were into conquests and that kind of thing, and you wanted to make sure that the land you just occupied couldn't be used to grow crops to feed an imposing armor army, you would plow the land with salt. Salt the earth, yeah, which is not the salt of the earth, because that means you're a good fellah, but not a good fella because those guys are salty. Wow, look at you. That was that was a team effort. Clever wordplay, my friend. Uh. If you take diuretics um or you have like massive diarrhea for a period of days, or vomiting or some sort of stomach bug, you might be at risk for hyponatremia. Yeah, because you're flushing out all of this, all of your electual lights. This is salt that your body needs. So if it's out of balance, you're going to suffer things like, um, well, an inability for your heart to beat, which is often fatal. Yea, kidney problems, yeah, um on the other hand, you can have hypernit tremia, which is too much salt, and like you said, if you're a Chinese aristocrat, um, you may die from hyper netremia. Yeah. They even had a m man sometimes a blanket on word how to manual. Well, it's sort of like how many grams of salt you needed per pound in your body? That like a chart. I guess if you want to kill yourself in China, yours I you do it. Yeah, there's so much salt you need? That was ro is he like that? Yeah? I'm off today. No, you know, I'm a little off. You were on my my microphone just swerved to the left, but were happening. There's a ghost in here. Um, so too much sodium, I think you said already is hypern tremia instead of hypo hyper hyper hypo exactly. It's like glacemia, but with no tremia exactly, and with hypernutremia. Basically, remember how salt if you um, if you introduce it to say, a jerky of some sort, it will dry it out. Yes, it's just a shameful thing to do. Um. If you introduce it to a meat or something like that, it's going to dry it out because through osmosis in search of homeostasis, um, it does the same thing to your blood and your extracellular fluids. That salt will draw out the fluids in your cells, but will maintain it in your blood. It's water retention basically. Yeah, your kidneys, when it has too much salt to deal with, kicks it around the blood supply. Just like remember in the hangover episode when you why drugs are so fatal when you drink a lot of alcohol because your kidneys are trying to process your the alcohol, so it keeps the drugs just going around and around in your blood supply. Same thing with too much salt. If your kidneys have too much to deal with, they just keep the excess going around in your blood. And since that salt is drawing out all the excess moisture and increase is the volume of your blood, which makes your blood pressure rise, which makes your heart beat, yes, which supposedly logically would put you at risk for a stroker heart attack, and that's how you would die from hypernatremia. Yeah, I have high blood pressure. Well, supposedly sodium. Cutting your sodium down isn't going to help. Yeah, there's a lot of conflicting data on that for sure. Um, well we'll get to nutrition soon. We'll cover that. Well, how about before we move on, do you want to do a message break? So chuck. Um. They're like you said, there's a lot of controversy over how much salt or how little salt you should have on a daily basis in your diet. Yeah. Um, the Heart National Heart, Blood and Long Institute say no more than two point four grams of sodium. It's about a teaspoon per day. Americans they found consume an average of a about three point four per day, So that's one gram too much on average. And um, you actually don't need more than about a half a gram a day if you want to maintain that stasis. So yeah, just for your electro light intake. The thing is, though, um, there was for many years because it makes sense that if you're if too much salt increases your blood pressure, then too much salt should be um, should put you at risk for strokes and heart attacks. Right. Well, the CDC panel surveyed material and all did and all all sorts of studies that found no, cutting your sodium intake doesn't really doesn't decrease your risk of heart attack or stroke. And as a matter of fact, there is was it just more hereditary. They don't know what it is. They just know that basically below three thousand grams or three thousand milligrams of salt and above seven thousand mill grams of salt a day were two groups that were at higher risk of heart attack. So if you have too little salt, you're at higher risk of heart attack. To okay, so try to keep it between three thousand and four thousand milligrams three thousand and seven th The thing is is they they don't They weren't comfortable making any recommendation. They were just sayone scared, this is what we found. Everyone scared, like, go on the record, yeah, because we just don't know. Like, it doesn't make any sense that you would have a heart attack if you ate less than three grams of sault today. That that flies in the face of of um conventional wisdom, and nobody's figured out why yet. Interesting, Well, it's something you should monitor at the very least, because I think a lot of people look at fat grams and calories and all that stuff is great to look at nutritionally, but um, when you start poking around on the soup can and you see, Wow, this chicken noodle soup has milligrams of sodium, but it's so good. And this one little can which is almost a gram of sodium, yeah close to it. A quarter pounder with bacon and cheese. You didn't do Big Max, Now I should have been communist. I think Big Max. Actually I did see this is milligrams. The big Mac I think was around leven pounds more. With the bacon. I think they have like a whole bacon onion ranch or something topping that you can put on quarter pounders. Now I've not yet tried this, but like I think about it from time to time, like right now, yeah, right now, especially uh so at anyway, just give it a look. Like soups are notoriously high in sodium. Package foods are notoriously high in sodium. Um, don't just think about the table salt that you use, Like, oh, I didn't salt my food that much today. You need a lot of package food or eating a lot of sodium. Yeah, and nobody can tell you how much you should be eating or shouldn't be eating. But like you said, it's good to just pay attention to that kind of thing, because you probably are eating a lot more than you realize, and you should be eating a lot of package food anyway, I'll just go ahead and say that, so um chuck, Yes, what kinds of salt are there? Well, first of all, I should say I love salt to Salt and pepper are my favorite two spices. I'm from the South, have a taste for salt um and pork fat. Yeah that's pretty southern too, Yeah for sure. Uh So I love salt. I like good Mediterranean sea salt. That's what I used at my house. Uh and I'm gonna plug this local saltier. I just made that word up oh later in the show. Okay, But um, I'm a big salt fan. I like salt too. I like sweet, I like ummi, I like um sour. I'm training myself to like bitter through the use of kampari. Yeah. Like I I've found out that I'm a bitter super taster. So, like things that seem like normal to other people are like really bitter to me. Like one example, fruit, Yeah, but it's like like it just gustingly bitter to me. Like I can't understand how the rest of humanity eats grape fruit. I don't like grapefruit. Well, maybe you're a bitter super taster too, But I have to tell you this, I've trained myself to like um, grapefruit and coompari just by exposure, like I've come to appreciate them. With campari, it's a bar like a bitter DIGESTI for Appritif you do like a campari and soda, it's in a negrowning right. Oh, I think I've seen people like if their stomachs upset or is that bitters and soda? Well, campari is a type of bitters. It's not that super compact bitters like angustura, but it is a type of bitter. I think it's a DIGESTI Okay, it's good stuff anyway. I like salt. What I'm really saying there is I like well seasoned food. And if you're a chef or a home chef, you know that salt is important to cooking, super important and baking obviously, but bland food can't do it. No, what's the point. What is the point? Agreed? Types of salt, well start with table salt and and like man, if your if your doctor put you on like a bland food diet, I feel for you. But there's stuff out there you can eat. There's spike, there's Mrs Dash, there's you should be seasoning your food to some extent, like bland food is is like it's bland life. Yeah. They even have the imitation salt of the New and New salt. I didn't do any research on that, but I've bought it before. You do you like it? I didn't use it that much, but it's it exists in my home thanks to the empty thing of Mediterranean sea salt. Yeah, all right, it's the table salt is the first one we should cover. That's the traditional um either iodized or non iodized, fine grained salt that you see in many many homes and restaurants, and it's IDEs. They did a little research into this. Did you look up iodie salt? Yeah, well, I mean I know that they they added it because at one point it was like fluoride. They thought, well, we need this in a good place to put it in salt. Yeah, because most people use salt, and we'll just put it into table salt because it's an easy additive. But um, there was a real problem with hyper thyroidism, things like Goiter's mental retardation. UM just poor fetal development linked to um iodine deficiency. So they put it in salt, and apparently there it's considered to be responsible for this thing called the Flynn effect, which there was like a three i Q point rise in the middle of the twentieth century in western nations and nobody could figure out what it is. And they think now that it was because they added iodine to salt, and so it had the aggregate effect of raising our i Q by um preventing poor fetal development. Yeah. Well, it's still a problem in other parts of the world, just not here in North America, right, other parts of the world that don't have IDI salt. You know, dumb they are. Oh man, that was terrible. I'm just kidding. You need to apologize to the rest of the world. I'm sorry everybody. Uh So, like I said, table saw, this is the most common salt. Uh. They remove all the impurities. Um. They have things in there to make it not clump and stick together, and so it pours freely, so even when it rains, it pours. Well, should we get to that. Yeah, don't you have something on that? Yeah? The UM I just for some reason thought of the Morton salt girl, and like every great advertising story, they were like, how do we It was sort of a new thing at the time, in nineteen eleven two package salt this way in a container with a spout. How they package it before? I don't know, the blocks, probably like a deer like or something. I'm not sure actually, but I know that this was a fairly revolutionary product to package it like this and process it like this. Um So the agency was um In w Air and Company, and Don Draper walks in and says, they've got twelve proposals for you, which one do you like? And Sterling Morton of the Morton Company, of course, it's always someone else, like his son or his wife or something. It was his son in secretary. Um pointed toward one of the ads with a little girl holding the umbrella and said this is the one, And he said, you know what, I think you guys are right. The whole story is right there in the picture. Because the whole point was this salt doesn't clump when it rains at poors, and the little girls can't be trusted to be sent to the store by themselves because they ruin all the salt. Keeping the nozzle open on the way home. Uh. Some of the different um slogans they had was flows freely, runs freely, pours, it never rains, but it pours. And then they finally settled on when it rains at poors. Yeah, that's the best because it never rains but it pors. Doesn't make any sense. They probably fired that person. And she's been updated one to three, four five times. Oh really yeah, the last time in nineteen sixty eight and she's been the same since then. And there was never a real model for that girl. That's a question they often get. She totally made up. Yeah, because he was like, it's Morton's granddaughters. What you know, you want to thank Selma Selma Morton. So that is the story of the Sken. That's an old timing name. If ever there was one that's a college right, No, it's like a person's name. Well, it's a college too. Had a friend that played soccer there e r s k I ny there's a college named Colgate too. It's like crazy to me, Uh, Sea Salt Sir is next. Uh. It's gonna cost you some more money because of several reasons, one of which if they go old school and In some parts of France, they still harvest the stuff by hand, which is pretty cool. You might see it called flair to sell, which is French for flower of salt, and uh, it's not processed like table salt is. So you're gonna have a lot of those trace minerals. It's gonna be coarse and flaky, and it colors it too. It can for sure, like you can have white sea salt, pink, black, gray, or a combination of them. Pink salts are traditionally associated with him alay and salt um, and there the pink is often for the result of things like copper or iron or apparently um. There's a type that contains an algae, a salt tolerant algae, which would make it an extreme aphile um. That gives it has the beta caroteen pigment in it, and that gives it a pinkish hue. That salt. You're eating algae, pink algae in your salt, which is pretty neat. That is pretty neat, and that that's Hawaiian, right. A lot of times Hawaii has a different one and alaya, Oh I read that as algae, Yeah, I did too. A couple of times and I was like, why would they separate these two out there's no g No, it's a Hawaiian Alaya salt has iron oxide in it from the volcanoes. Oh, that makes sense. And WHOI also produces black salt too from the lava. Yeah, in a little bit of charcoal. I'll have to try some of those actually, and yeah, and then there's gray salts to um, which is uh, there's cell gree which is from France. And then smoked salt is also gray, where they just take some salt and smoke it. Yeah, they put it over a smoky fire, and you have smoked salt. Do you like smoky foods sometimes? Yeah, it could be a little overbearing for me at times. Yeah, in the hands of you know, I guess somebody who knows what they're doing with the smoked It's like, I like a good smoked meat, little day type of thing, but not necessarily like you know, when they add like artificial smoke in the kitchen to it to a meal. You know what I'm saying. Although smoked cheese is good, oh yeah, man, good smokey. And thanks to fan Hillary Lozar from for sending us some great cheese. Yeah, that was very good to you. I had some of that smoked goody yesterday. Actually when I got home, I haven't had it yet. Is it good? And as soon as I walked in the door, I got a knife out. It's like, I gotta try this stuff. Yeah's delicious anyway, Thanks Hilary. Um So, chefs and Gormond's will say sea salt is what you want to be using because you're gonna get a unique flavor from those minerals that are not in table salt. I agree with them. It's tough to bake with though, Yeah, it's tough to measure. You get a lot more precise measuring, for sure from table salt. And they don't recommend you bake with sea salt, no, because baking is a specific chemical reaction. Cooking is different. Yeah, they say that they most chefs don't cook with sea salt, but they will just add it as a topper. But I've cooked with sea salt and I have no plenty of chefs that cooked with sea salt, So I disagree with that. Um Well, they with the topper, they mean like it's a finishing salt. It brings out like all the flavors if you sprinkle it on them. Yeah, I mean it's definitely used, but I've also seen it used in the food right so well, that leads us to kash your salt. Apparently some people like to cook with kosher salt. And if you are using following a recipe and you're switching out the whatever amount of salt is called for, you want to double it because kasher salt is larger, coarse grained salt. And here to me is a fact of the podcast, want to several Kosher salt is not necessarily kosher itself. It's used to make things kosher. That I didn't. I thought kasher salt was like salt that had been blessed by a rabbi or something. Really I never understood it, but now I do. It's it's salt they used to make things kosher. If you use table salt UH to make something kosher, it's not gonna work. Kasher salt because it's large and coarse grained. UH makes meat kosher by drawing the blood out because eating blood ain't kosher. So if you salt it with kosher salt, it's gonna draw the blood out of the meat. Then bam, you have a kosher cut of steak baby boom. And it's not iodized either, right by the way. Um. And then we have the redheaded step child of the salt family, rock salt, which is used. Um. It's got a lot of impurities, it's unrefined, it's very large grained, and it's used to melt ice on roads and sidewalks and to make homemade ice cream. Yeah, and probably some other stuff. But do you know of any other uses? I think rock salts used in um, some chemical productions. That makes sense. Um, if you want to make a good industrial brine, rock salts your your man. Yeah, alright, salt mining, that's how you get salt, because it is a natural thing that exists in the earth. UM. The largest producer of salt these days, no surprise, is China. UM. In two thousand twelve they produced about sixty five million tons. The US is not too far behind a forty four million. Then you've got Germany, India and Australia as the other leading top five salt producers these days. In India gets the profit from in salt production thanks to Gandhi. I guess so, huh that's pretty neat. And think about that. The number four on the list. Yeah, and they weren't even allowed to produce it not so long ago. No, they were allowed to produce it, but all the money went to Yeah, okay jerks. So there's three types of mining main three main types. There's deep shaft mining, solar evaporation, and solution mining. And deep shaft mining is basically like any other type of mining, where you just um, drill a shaft down into a mine, which an underground sea bed is what where the salt is, right, that's where you get your salt. Um. Yeah, that's I think that's one of the facts of the podcast. Yeah, they're ancient underground seabed, ancients beds that dried up and the salt remained and they formed, um these basically salt deposits that can be dozens or hundreds of feet thick and massively wide, and you drill down into these things. You create a couple of shafts, and then they usually use what's called a room and pillar system, which really helps. It's very difficult to explain, but if you see a picture of it it makes perfect sense. But um, you're basically creating a checkerboard pattern going down in mining. The salt deposits so you leave it right, Yeah, you blast a room, but you leave a couple of adjacent rooms for support and then um, eventually you've you've mined out all the salt and then you fill it with industrial waste. That is one thing they do. So that's deep shaft mining. Yeah. And they'll remove the salt there and crush it and uh pull it to the service and further process it from there, depending on what kind of salts you want in the end. Right. And there's this awesome mine um called the Wheelishka Salt Mine in Cracow, Poland, and it has a full on cathedral made out of salt. Amazing. They have several like chapels, but then a full cathedral um and it's all made us salts in this old salt mine that's not a UNESCO site um. And they went to the trouble of boiling salt. It was a table salt mine. They would boil this raw salt and purify it and then use that purified salt to make crystal chandeliers out of salt. Like, the whole cathedral is just salt. It's amazing looking man. Yeah, check it out. No goats allowed. They would recap it or no chucks allowed, just walk around like licking stuff. They would ask you nothing. Uh. A deep shaft mining, by the way, I think is usually rock salt is what they're producing there. And then there's solution mining. Yeah, that's UM. Basically they take a well over a salt bed and then inject water in there and make a brine and then pump it up from the underground as as a wet solution and into a vacuum pan, which is gonna seal it up, and they're gonna boil it and then evaporate it, which is you know how they made salt back in the old days too, They would you know, boil it and evaporate it and then scrape the pan, right, So it's kind of a modern version of that. Then they dry it out and refine it, and then from there they're gonna either add anti clumping agents or iodine, depending on what you want. And then um, with solution mining, you've got like a salt bed or a salt dome that's exposed because it's somehow through tectonic action. Uh, an ancient seabed or salt bed has been exposed to the above ground like the surface of the Earth. Right, and then what's what's the last one. Well, the old school solar method um solar evaporation. This is when you have a salt lake or seawater and wind in the sun cooperate with the shallow pools and they leave salt behind and you can only harvested about once a year, once it reaches a certain level of harvestability, um of thickness and uh something like we said, sometimes it's still done by hand, even although it is industrialized in other places for sure. But you know, they wash it, they clean it, they drain it, but they leave the um a lot of impurities in there. And this stuff is almost a percent pure sodium chloride. It's good stuff. And like I said, I used the Mediterranean version generally, but Australia is a big on it too, on this method. And um, we should probably mention also that salt has a lot of religious significance. It's just a it's an ancient important thing to mankind. Yeah, they would like use it to seal important things. Yeah, in the Old Testament, which is pretty old. Uh, Lot's wife, I believe her name is Sarah, was it Sarah Ruth? Who was married a Lot turned into a pillar of salt when she looked behind her. Even though, guys that don't turn around, I'll turn you into a pillar of salt. Yeah, and she did. And apparently there's a there's a salt pillar at Mount ararat Um that's called Lot's wife. People are like, that's her right there, and who who uh is it? Buddhists that board off evil with salt. Yes, um Umi has a little shaker of salt that her mom put in her glove compartment of her car. If they like flickr off on the just a protector. Yeah that's nice. See I would have eaten it. Yeah. Well that's why I don't let you ride. That's right, one of several reasons they out of the bots, you got anything else? I do? I have this good thing. And there's a Roman senator named Cassio Doris and he said, quote, mankind can live without gold, but not without salt. Who's that cassio key boartists? Yet? Well you got Jerry again. Yeah, she's giggly today. And I have a plug because here in Atlanta there's a a lady who makes salts. But if you go to Facebook and type in beauty, a full briny sea salt go to her Facebook page and click on the about thing. You will see her lovely homemade, handcrafted salts. And my favorite is the magic unicorn. See if this sounds good. Sea salt is of course the main ingredient smoked paprika, lemon, garlic, rosemary, and celery seed. Well it does sound good. It's delicious. You get some broccoli and some cauliflower, some like beets and big chunks of garlic, throw it out the window and buy a steak and put this magical unicorn on it some olive oil, sprinkle it with this stuff, bake it in the oven. Delicious to go with that steak. You know. Yeah, magic unicorn is my favorite. Uh. And the black Truffle salt is delicious. And then she has one called camp Fire, which is smoked salt with cumin and anto chili powder. And uh, if you email info at Beautiful Briny Sea Salt dot com you can order some of this stuff. And I told Emily she's frind or as I said, tell her, I'm gonna plugger, so she better get her little fingers working, you know, nic start making some salt. Yeah, because the stuff you should army is a salty crowd So if you want to learn more about salt, I don't know how you possibly could, but if you want to look into it, you can type the word as a LT into the search bar how stuff works dot com and it will bring up this article how salt works. And since I said search part, that means it's time for a listener mail. I'm gonna call this. We should apologize to cops. What do we do now? Well, this cop wrote in and it well, I'll just read it. Is it the police chase this one? Yeah? Yeah, they didn't like that one. Hey guys, my name is Glenn. I'm a police officer in southern California. I've been enjoying the podcast for years. I suspect our political leanings made different times, but I always enjoy learning and listening to different points of view. Listen to the December sev Hunt podcast. That's not the police chase one. You're right, but I think it involves something like that. I felt it was very accurate with the accept of some information you provided about the l a p D. Um We batched the l a p D before for their history of corruption. They have a pretty thick history of corruption, but they're not all bad. Ladies and men. Well, no, of course not. Um. You mentioned that officers were super jumpy during the man hunt for Christopher Dorner, which was a fair assessment. But here's where you got something kind of wrong. Um. You stated that the l a p D fired on two uninvolved vehicles. It was the l a p D who shot at one in the Torrent's Police Department shot at the other. I could see how someone not from the area might think they were l A p D. So it's not the big of a deal. However, the bigger mistake is that you stated that these shootings killed two people. Nobody was killed, So I need to go back. I saw in several places that at least two people were killed, Yeah, accidentally from those shootings. I'll go back and look again. Okay, but Glenn Josh takes issue. Sir, Well, he's not the only one who's written in I just haven't gotten around going back and looking and double checking. But I mean, while we were re searching, I came across that and it wasn't like on a forum or message board or something. I think they were in articles. Okay, well, we'll get to the bottom of it. Uh he was, Glenn says I'm very surprised you would make such a statement without doing your own work. I did my homework. You typically appear to go to great links to fact check. Sometimes you get the feeling you guys are not the biggest fans of law enforcement. UM not. And I even recognize my profession shortcomings for sure, just like you, though. I want facts um influencing the show, not personal opinions. And this email was not intended to justify the actions of those two police departments. Just to set the record straight, understood, And despite the goof and the cop bashing ha ha, I still love the show. That's from Glenn Um and Glenn, I don't hate cops. I love cops. Um. We've done a lot of like super supportive shows on law enforcement, name talks like The Law Enforcement Dude. But I don't like jerks, And I think a lot of times people's experience with cops or when they're pulled over and not being helped by a cop, which is unfortunate because they do much great work. But you know, when you get pulled over and you're hassled by a jerk cop, you think, man, what a jerk cop. It's like eating at a bad restaurant. You know what I'm saying. Like restaurant, you tell one or two people you have a bad experience at a restaurant, you tell like twenty people. It's like fifty fold with cops. So we have a lot of respect for law enforcement for sure, for all they do. So I hope that doesn't across come across is any differently nice, very excitful to Yeah, thanks Glenn, Yeah, thank you Glenn. I'll go back in double check. If I'm wrong, I'll admit it. I just haven't had a chance to look again. We'll give them twenty licks off of a black as vault from a goat, and I might die of hyper natremia. Man, that wrapped it all up right there.
