Josh: Hey, you welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh, there's Chuck and Dave's here in spirit of course, and this is short stuff on dingoes. And I can bet you a trillion dollars the next thing that Chuck is going to say, hmm, could be one of two things. No, it's just the one I met dingoes in Australia and I just lost a trillion dollars because of you. Were you gonna say a dingo ate, my baby? I was going to say that. You were going to say that. No, I really was going to save that uh. And and talk very briefly about when we went on our tour of Australia and my buddy Scotty met me over there and we were able to take a couple of days and go to this uh and we did a lot of stuff. But one day we went to this I guess a game ranch. I don't know what they call him over there, but you know, we hold koala bears and all that stuff, and we got to have the dingo experience where we out into a dingo pin. Yeah. I fought him, Yeah, I fought him to the dead. It was cool and it was it was like, did you see dingoes when you were over there, did you meet anything? No, I I know, And it's weird, like because because you did something like that too, right, Yeah, we saw I don't think I saw dingoes. We went to one of those things. We hung out with kangaroos and hung out with koal and all that stuff, But I don't remember seeing a dingo. And I looked up dingoes and I was like, that is not what I had in my head. And I realized I've been thinking hyenas this whole time. Yeah, it's they were, you know, because you want to as a dog owner for my whole life, you wanted to be like, oh, it's just a dog. But it's not just a dog. It was different. It had a different disposition, they walked a little different. It was um it's sort of like when you see a coyote and you're like, oh no, no no, no, that's not a dog. Yeah, it's a wild dog. Yeah. And a dingo. Actually inteen got its own designation as Cannis Familiar RS. And this was all in my research to find out, like, is a dingo a dog really? And I think that they are descended from the same line, but they have their own distinction. Now, well, Caine is familiaris is the dog that's the domestic dog, like momos a Kene is familiaris Lucy's kines. No, there was another one. Then they came up with a new name altogether. Okay, so it is its own species thing because I saw somewhere um that that host on a I think it was called Animal Logic, uh did a YouTube video I watched on them, and she said that that they may be their own species. So that's a new thing. Then I think I'm double checking now because I feel like a dope. It says dingo declared a separate species. I think I just got the name wrong. God, look at those cute little guys. I know they are cute. They look you know what, they look a lot like or she but he knews they totally do. My friend Meredith has those and they look a lot like those. Yeah, and which would makes sense because they have definitely connected. I don't think definitively, but let's say that they definitely and that somebody carried out a study. So they definitely carried out a study, but that they connected dingoes to Southeast Asian dogs and uh, sheba, you knew are definitely Asian East Asian UM. So it's entirely possible that they are highly related. At the very least they look a lot like sheba, you knows, and we can at least leave it at that right, And of course they are still in Asia today as far as their distribution. But they really you think of Australia when you think of a dingo, They've been around for thousands of years there. They are UM I think, the largest mammal carnivore in Australia. And depending on where you find these guys in Australia, they might be different colored if you what you usually think of is that sort of like the sheba's, those sort of ginger coats with a little white feet, a little white feet socks. But apparently they can be a little more golden yellow UM in the desert, I think yeah, And they can also be the ones that live along the edges of a forest are usually a darker brown or even almost black too so, and they can they can live wherever. Apparently it's a source of water is the thing that really limits them because they'll eat just about anything and their opportunistic feeders. But depending on where they live, their their coats will have developed a different color, that's right. Uh, they breed once a year and they have five or six little pups and they'll raise them cute and uh they raise them in like protected areas, like a sheltered rock area. It says here that they can they can be raised in wombat burrows or rabbit warrens or hollow logs. And I believe they wean at about two months and they could either be left behind there that the mom and the dad both help raise, which is kind of cool. But at that two month period when they're weaning, they can either be abandoned or they might hang around for about a year and freeload on the couch. All right, Yeah, they're cute too. Man. Have you seen like little dingo pups now? But I I saw that between six and seven months they're basically totally equipped to be on their own if they need to be. That's right. They can reak havoc. They're kind of known as a pest in Australia. Yes, especially if you're in the livestock industry. Yeah, they can reabo on the lads stock. And I don't know if it's still the biggest fence in the world, but at least at the time, the largest fence on planet Earth was erected to protect grazing lands from protective sheep from these dingos five thousand kilometers long. I bet it's still the biggest one. It's got to be. It's still up for sure. But it was raised in the nineteenth century by the livestock industry saying, like dingoes, you stay over here. And it worked so much so that they're finding that, um, you know, dingos are an ape tex predator, like you said, they're the largest carnivore on the continent in Um Australia UM. And as an apex preator, they kind of keep populations in check, and there's all sorts of knock on effects, like they hunt kangaroos, and apparently they found that kangaroos that aren't predated by dingoes um tend to overeat and the population can actually starve because they eat too much vegetation and strip the land of its vegetation, and dingoes actually helped keep that in check. So there's supposedly, according to animal logic, at least a debate over whether to let dingoes back over the fence, but the livestock industry is like nay, not like of course yes. And if you're wondering if those dogs, those dingoes you're seeing our part dog in Australia, Um, there's about a thirty percent chance that it is been doing the deed with the dog. Yeah. I think a third of Southeastern Australia's dingoes or hybrids. Right, Okay, so chuck, let's take a break and then we'll come back and spit some more dingo facts after this stop. Okay, so we're back. I have one, Um, dingoes supposedly don't bark. They can howl. They communicate by howling. It's not like they just sit there quietly and just shrug like they bark. They don't bark, is the thing, which is kind of interesting because well I don't know why it's interesting now that I think about it, but it seemed interesting at the time when I first heard it. Yeah, I think they can bark, but they tend not to. They tend to communicate with those little holley sounds. Right. So um, that was really I think the last great dingo fact leading up to the big finish, don't you think? Yeah, the big question did a dingo eat that baby? Well, tell everybody what you're talking about, especially the ones who haven't seen Seinfeld aren't fans of the Meryll Meryl Street. Yeah, there was a movie called what was a Cry in the Dark in nineteen or just Crying the Dark in nineteen where Meryl Streep played Lyndy Chamberlain with the very famous Selacious murder trial that happened in the nineteen eighties when very very tragically Um her her young daughter, Azaria Chamberlain, was nine weeks old and disappeared when they were camping in Australia and she was She went to prison for murder, they said, they concluded, and this is without any kind of evidence whatsoever. They concluded that it was actually a sort of a lack of evidence that helped convictor Um that she like slit her baby's throat in the car and then went back in was with her camping, you know, with her family camping, and then went back into the tent and started screeching out the famous lines A dingo either took my baby or a dingo ate my baby, yes, and like so Australia didn't show its best face on this initially. There was like basically a like Australians just didn't believe at the time that dingos would would unprompted or unprovoked attack human and carry off even a nine week old baby. It just didn't make sense. There was no record of them ever doing that, so it seemed unlikely to begin with. But I read also that they that there was apparently a bit of um xenophobia against the Chamberlain family because they were Seventh Day Adventists. I think so, like there were rumors that the daughter's name meant um sacrifice in the wilderness um, and just weird stuff like that, like like nothing pretty um. And and the idea that Lyndy Chamberlain was actually put in prison on just total circumstantial evidence. Uh, it's pretty significant she was finally released, and I think the family was paid by the state um because she got railroaded and everyone knew she didn't actually do it. But there was just never any conclusive evidence that a dingo did eat her baby until another kid got attacked, right, Well, I didn't hear about that. Um. One of the big pieces of lack of evidence was the fact that she said that her baby had on a what's called a Mattinee jacket. It's like a little it's sort of like a little cape cardigan thing that you put on a baby, and they didn't find that thing anywhere, so they were like, she's lying because a mother knows how they dressed their babies. And they recovered the baby clothes, but um which had some blood on him around the neck, which is why they thought she slit her throat. But they didn't recover this Mattinee jacket, and so that helped convict her. And then uh, in nineteen eighty six, a guy was climbing uh in that camping area, fell to his death, and when they discovered the remains a few weeks later, they found that little Matinee jacket and that helped. Uh. That helped spring her from prison. Okay, well, then maybe it was the popular public opinion changed when it emerged that like other kids had been attacked by dingoes or were later on. And then finally, I think in two thousand twelve, you dug up a New York Times article that UH, the fourth coroner's inquest into the death of his area chamberlain UH finally vindicated Lyndy Chamberlain said that no dingo did kill this little girl. It's definitely not her mom, and they amended her death certificate finally final, like true vindication. Yeah, but apparently Lindy Chamberlain was like, I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep agitating for these corner in quests until I'm finally exonerating. And then she finally was so that's dingoes. Uh. You can try and sugar on them like dogs, but the ones at this game wrench weren't weren't dogs. They didn't want to snug as much. Okay, good advice. I pulled out all the stops. I know, all the tricks you tried to give him, pap RONI. Yeah, I gave him all the scritches and all the right places, and they were just like, okay, I'll be over here. Yeah. Thanks human.
