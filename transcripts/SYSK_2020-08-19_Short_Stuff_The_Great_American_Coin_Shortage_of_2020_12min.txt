Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short stuff on Josh, there's Chuck. Jerry's over there. Let's get going. This is short stuff about shortages of coins. Shortly. Yeah, hey, can you spare some change? Uh? No? Why not? Um? What was it? I can't remember who said? Think the line is? Haven't your head? Is a coin shortage? Okay, let's try this again. Hey, Mr Keney spares some change? No? Why not? Haven't you heard? There's a what line? Coin shortage? There's a coin shortage? And that summarizes our TV show success quite nicely, and scene and scene, so we're there. Really is a coin shortage? Or dramatization was a real one or based on real life, a true story in the United States. Um our listeners in Australia and New Zealand and UK and Germany who knew you know, Um, did we hear from a German? Is that what happened? Uh? They said, yes, we're listening to you in Germany, okay, And they said cryptically and watching. And what what some of you guys who are in America might not realize is that if you went into a store, the stores that are open right now during the pandemic here in the United States, you might find a sign that says, please pay with exact change or use a credit card because we ain't got no change for you, uh, if you need it. And it's actually kind of becoming a bit of a problem and a conspiracy theory over here. Yeah, so there are coins out there. Um. The U. S. Treasury says that there were almost forty eight billion dollars worth of coins in circulation in April of this year, which is about four million more than last year. But the deal is is those those coins aren't moving there. They got no movement going on like they usually do for a few reasons. Obviously, when businesses closing and banks sort of closing and reducing their hours, and things like arcades and laun dramats and public transit where you use a lot of coins, and convenience stores, when all that stuff closes up, it's gonna put a serious dentt in the coin flow. It is because I mean, all of these these businesses that are especially coin heavy, Um, they they act as kind of like part of the circulatory system that moves coins through the economy. And if they're not closed, meaning they're not accepting coins, you can't let the coins pass through them, so instead they go back home to people's houses, which is where a lot of them are right now. Um. Also, simultaneous to that, Chuck the U s Mint was like, well, we don't want to put our people at risk, so we're actually gonna slow production and furlough a bunch of people because we don't want them on the job giving COVID to one another, which is kind of sensible. And then beyond that, even if you do have a business, a lot of people are saying, you know, they want like contact lists, they don't want cash passing back and forth. They'll maybe shove a credit card reader in your face from a poll that it's attached to and they'll say, stick your credit card in that. Um not doing a lot of cash or asking for exact change. And again that just means there are coins out there, they're just not flowing through the economy like they normally do. Right, So for all these reasons, there is an actual a coin shortage, not a coin shortage, and that they don't exist, but a coin shortage, and that they're not flowing through like they're supposed to. Like you were saying, which I mean, if you were, um, a thinking person you might buy this time, have thought who cares? It doesn't matter, but it does for a lot of reasons. And at first is that UM. There are a lot of stores, kinds of stories like you said, UM transit, public transit UM, you know, the public transit store where you go to buy public transits and coins UM, and then laundromats. There are certain kinds of businesses that heavily rely on the free and open flow of coinage UM for their businesses to function. And if you go into one of those businesses and they say you need to pay with exact change, is that okay? Some of their customers are gonna be like, no, it's not okay. I want I don't have exact change, and I want my change back. Some of those stores have tried to get creative and have said, how about rather than us give you change back, we donated on your behalf to a charity, like you kind of round up your bill to have some of that donated. That makes sense, But if you're kind of going through hard times, which a lot of us are, you want that change back. So then some stores have said, okay, all right, we don't actually have physical coins here to give you change, But we can give you a store gift card with that amount on it. How about that? And some customers said, that's fine, whatever, But I can't imag magine how much of a dent in a store's efficiency. Stopping and adding like thirty eight cents to a gift card for every third customer who wants to pay with cash is doing to to The stores in the United States that are, by the way, are already struggling because they have opened up in this pandemic um simply because they need to to keep the lights on. Yeah, or some stores are saying, how about in lieu of the thirty seven sins, I compose a poem in which I integrate the words thirty seven cents and I will sing it to you, right, or maybe it takes a lot of time. Maybe our head cash, your Bucky will give you thirty eight cents where the pot from his stash. I wonder what thirty eight since where the pot looks like? I don't know. Probably that's a lot, right, sure, from everything I've read. Should we take a break? Yes, all right, we'll be right back with more coin shortage. Well, now we're on the road, driving in your truck. Want to learn a thing or two from Josh man Chuck and stuff you should know. All right, all right, so we got a coin shortage and ain't flowing. The National Grocer's Association and some other retail trade groups sent a letter to Jerome Powell, the Fed Reserve chair and Steve how do you pronounce that hard nucan the manuch? No, that's the mooch Scar Moucci that you're thinking of. Oh, that's right. Uh. He's the Treasury Secretary. And they sent a letter in June saying, hey, you're rationing these coin shipments to the banks, and that's really threatening our business because it's you know, we come from a place of privilege to be able to sit around a joke about this because I'm like, oh, I'll just put everything on my m X because I get sky miles that are now useless. But here's the deal. If you have a household income below twenty dollars, you are paying for cash. Uh, you're paying for of your transactions and cash. Right. This is why finally we reach why it really actually matters, because there's a significant number of Americans out there who depend on having cash handy. Because the banks have said we don't think you're worthy of having a bank account, and the credit card companies have said, we're not going to extend you any credit. So all you've got is cash. That's your only option. And so if you aren't if the store is trying to give you some some business or run around about domint donating your thirty eight since the charity, no, you probably want that thirty eight cents back, and not having that thirty eight cents in circulation is a big problem for a large number of people. Yeah, here's a couple of other stats that may be surprised zing if you always just throw down your credit card. Uh, forty five to sixty of sales at all grocery stores and comedian stores or cash, and uh for ten dollars or less. About half of all transactions period in the US are paid in cash if they're ten dollars or less. Yes. And also, I mean there's a plenty of like gas stations and convenience stores out there that have us a longstanding policy that you know, nothing under five dollars or three dollars or whatever can be put on a card because as credit cards piece can can really add up for a store like that. Um So now they have no choice. If they don't have change to give out, they have to take that credit card payment. So that's dending their bottom line to the little um small business owners as well. It's just a huge cluster that needs to be fixed, Chuck. Yeah, and the fixed sort of there isn't a real fix right now because everything that's going on. You can't just put some artificial You can't just like flood the market with coins because the problem is they're not flowing anyway. It's not that they aren't there. So the real solution is just eventually things will slowly return to normal as far as coin circulation goes, just like everything else returning to normal. Um. But they are ramping up production of coins because they, I guess heard the letter and they don't want to short change the banks at least, and I think the usual is a billion coins a month. They're now producing one point two billion coins a month at least in June, and then one point three five billion a month for the rest of the year. Yeah, which I mean that's a substantial increase for sure. Yeah, um, because yeah that we're talking about three hundred and fifty million additional coins a month for the rest of that's a huge uptick, so they're definitely responding, But it seems like what everybody's saying is, hey, you with the coin jar and you're cupboard, like you're you're the problem, Like go take your coin jar to the coin star. I think they um the FED actually specifically aimed coin star as a place where you should take your coins and trade them in for a gift card or some cash or something like that. Or if you don't want to pay whatever fee coin star um charges, you can actually go into the bank take your coins. They will be happy to see you for the first time in their entire banking history showing up with a jar full of coins, being like, can I have this in exchange for some bills UM? That will help get it back into circulation as well. Or you could just start spending them like pay in coins um out of your your coin jar that you have at home, reintroduce it into the economy, in fact, is another way to put it. Yeah, I can't remember when we talked about this, but we talked about coins before and taking into the bank and the fact that Emily and I when we were first together and just broke as you could imagine, would go on change dates, because we would go to that coin star machine and dump them in there. And I think that's when you said that you didn't do coin star because of the fee. If I'm not mistaking, the sounds like something I would say, Yeah, it was a long time ago though, yeah, well still the same. It's it'll be etched on my tombstone. He wouldn't pay the fee. Um, So you can do something by spending coins. That's a big one. Um. And there's actually a hashtag that this coin task force that got put together came up with called get coin Moving, not even coins, get coin Moving, brick love lamp. It's it's pretty bad. Um. And here's a little tidbit for you to chew on while you're going through your coin jar um, trying to figure out what you're gonna buy first with it. A coin in the United States remains in circulation for up to thirty years, So all those coins that are pumping full of the economy with they're going to be around for a while, whereas the paper bills that we have usually only last about a year and a half. Wow, that's it for sure, stuff, chuck, don't you think I think so? Well? The short Stuff says everybody Giddeah. Stuff You Should Know is a production of I heart Radio's How Stuff Works.
