Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from how Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry over there, and this is Stuff you Should Know Unsolved Mysteries Edition. How do you pronounced this? Diet love? Diet love. Yeah, that's how I've always pronounced it. That's what we're going with, Okay. For some reason, I always just always Oh, that's a good one. I like that, a bit of a Russian diet love playing just say get love anyway. Get Love is the name of a famous pass in the Ural Mountains, and it was named after it turns out a twenty three year old mountaineer expert outdoors person uh named um uh Igor do out love. I always want to call him Uri because there was like five Yuris in his group, but he was the only Igor. Yeah, And I did not know that this pass was named for him. And when I first started researching this, I was like, that's yeah, Uh, shall we tell the story? Yeah, let's people might have you you'd heard of this before, right? Yeah? And I believe we may have touched on this in the top ten once maybe, but or a video that we did. But whatever it was, it was a little tiny, short thing. I mean we mentioned the Gary Matthias disappearance was called the American do at Love event Ye disappearance. Um, this is this is totally different in a lot of ways, in most ways, but you can find kind of find some similarities here there. But yeah, let's tell the story man, all right. So we're talking about a group of students in nineteen fifty nine, early February from you're all u r a l State Technical University. Go what go fighting rook the hammers and sickles. That sounds good, the hammers and sickles. Uh. They were all very um well acquainted with camping, back country hiking, and skiing across country skiing. So they weren't a bunch of rookies out there. No, no, and that's really important, Like these people were very well experienced with this kind of stuff. Yeah, they knew what they were doing. And there was a group of how many were there? Seven they're ten total? Oh tin total, nine of whom actually went into the woods. The only person to make it out of this trip alive was the one person who stayed back because he wasn't feeling well, stayed behind the village. That was another yury yury udine. Um. Yeah, I got a little sick and was bummed, And little did he know that would have been almost certainly a life saving moment for him. Yeah, he had a rheumatism and came down with about of rheumatism and actually stayed back in this little tiny village where they they set off from. And to say that they were like in the middle of nowhere is an understatement. Like they were in the middle of nowhere, not a lot going on there, and I think like a two two plus week trip, and they were trying to get to mount or to ten right, yeah, or t o They were trying to make it to this mountain, which is a part of the Ural Mountains, um. And to get there they basically cross country skied, they climbed this, They climbed mountains to get to this mountain. They had to camp out and this this like negative thirty degree weather. Um, just crazy nuts, middle of nowhere, and they were having the time of their lives. These students were. Yeah there, I mean there. There is footage or footage by way of photographs because they took a lot of pictures and if you go through and look at the um the early parts of this trip, they did look like they were having a lot of fun. They were, they were good pals. They did a very adorable thing on the way they they started making their own little newspaper about the trip, the Evening Ordered ten where they would just it was essentially a little fun diary, like group diary they did, but they put it in the form of a of a daily newspaper of their journey, which is very very cute and sad. Yeah, And one of the one of the ways I saw their group described was that there were there were two girls in this group and the rest of the guys um, but that there wasn't any like real sexual tension or rivalries going on. That there was like kind of crushes here there and like like like humorous flirtation that kind of thing, just keeping everything real light. Yeah, but it wasn't like Uri betrayed me nothing with she wasn't name Urie hooked up with Zena. What's one of them Zena? Yeah, there was Zena and then uh lud uh lud Mia just laughing. You try it. Jerry came and talked, you know, she minored in Russian studies. I had no idea. Did I ever tell you? By the time you Me and I went to visit friends in London and we were on our way to to go to Moscow for these the guys that I met in London, Yes, who now live in l A. Mikeldam, Oh, they're wonderful. They live in l A. Now, welcome to America, dudes. Um. But we went to visit them in London and found out that Um, because Adam I think majored in Russian studies or Russian literature. I think he's like, you you have your visa and we're like, what do you mean. He's like, you have to have a visa to go to Russia and we're like, I don't think so no one said anything to us about that, and he's like, no, you definitely do. We call the airline. They're like, yeah, you don't have a visa and we're like, how did you not You mean like a visa card, right, that's what we thought you meant, and um, we didn't go to Russia. I think I remember we ended up going to Majorca instead. Last minute, Oh well right, We're like this could have been way worse than it turned out. I think I remember you having plans to go to Russia and I never heard anything. That's why we didn't think. I remember at some point in my life being like, that's weird, Josh never talked about Russia, but you heard me talk about Mayorca. Yeah, it all adds up. Now, that's that was all that trip. Interesting. Yeah, so that's my Russia story. That's as close as I've come. That's funny because you guys are pretty buttoned up. I know, we're really surprised at ourselves, you guys. Yeah, all right, thanks for that, Chuck. I appreciate that about you being buttoned up. Yeah. Yeah, that's sounds like something I would do. I don't know, that's pretty basic level stuff. I think these people would catch that. All right. So where are they? They're on the Mountain of the Dead, which I don't believe we mentioned was the was the translation that the local indigenous tribe, the Monsey tribe, called this mountain collots Yakle the Mountain of the Dead, and the Monsey tribe, um, we'll we'll pop up later in theories. So just we're putting pins and things. Do you remember in our magic mushroom episode where we talked about like um reindeer herder who would feed their reindeer mushrooms and then drink the pea to trip themselves. I think I do remember that that's the man. They're like Siberian um nomad's I believe, and who know how to party. Yeah, and like the magic mushrooms that they're shame their shamans eat and probably their regular people eat too. They're very toxic um and one way to get rid of the toxins is to feed him to reindeer, and the the reindeers filter toxin. You drink the reindeer p and the psychoactive stuff is still present in their pa. Wow. Yeah, and they think that possibly I'm saving this for the Christmas episode. Okay, okay, so go ahead. I'm sorry that that's the monster people. Yeah, that's the monster people. So um. What they end up doing is they decide on the night of February twod to camp and in a decidedly sort of odd place. It wasn't so weird, but they were only about a mile from the tree line, where they would have had much better cover. Um, and it would have been slightly warmer, and it's just it makes more sense to camp in the in the forest than out on this open ridge. But nevertheless, for some reason they decided to camp there. They think possibly because they didn't want to backtrack, because they would have had to backtrack something to get back to the tree line. Yeah, they would have had to go a mile back down the slope, which means that they would have had to go cover that mile up again. And that's what Urie. What's the guy who was his last name uri Uton? Yeah, that's what he later said in an interview that he he thought it was either that that um the out love didn't want to backtrack because he d love as a leader, remember um, or he wanted to practice camping on an exposed mountain slope, which from what I've heard about this guy, it sounds like something he might do. He might be like, hey, gang, I've got a great idea. We've never done this right, let's try it. And they would have been able to quite easily. Um. They pitched. They pitched the camp. But in between pitching camp, and this is February second, ninety nine, in between pitching camp and making dinner, something happened. They never got to make dinner and whatever happened to them happened in between that time. On February second. We'll be back right after this. All right, that was quite a teaser, my friend, Thank you. You can talk regular now. So, uh, the search party didn't go out right away because yet Loft had said before, um, hey, we're going to be back around February twelve, or maybe a bit longer if we are so inspired to stay out there a bit longer, which is or yeah, if it's going slower than we thought, right, which is not the I mean, nowadays people will be a little more buttoned up like you guys and say a little more specific maybe when you're hiking in a place like this, but nevertheless, or have like a satellite phone with you or something. But again, so these these kids are in the middle of nowhere, totally cut off from contact. It was we're going in in January. You'll hear from us, probably around February twelve or so. Yeah, But because he put a wishy washy timeline on it, um, it didn't. It wasn't until they that anyone had any suspicions that anything was wrong, and then not until the twenty six that volunteer searchers finally found this camp. Yeah, that was much much later. So they found the camp and right out of the gate, they're like, this is a little weird. The tents seem to have been cut from the inside out. That's a very weird thing. Not only that their boots are here, Um, their clothes are here, their gears here, their skis, like everything they would need it was all just abandoned at this camp. Yeah, it looked like a left in a hurry. Um. And then even even stranger from what from the official report, and we'll see that that was like this has gone on for so long and been open to so much interpretation that, um, there's a lot of taint to this legend um that the but the official ports said that there were maybe eight or nine tracks, the tracks of eight or nine people around these tents, So that would account for everybody in the party without the addition of other people being on scenes. Yeah, and the way they left, like you said, like it was almost as if they they went and got in their tents, zipped them up and found um a dozen pit vipers and each one because they cut out of the tent and ran away in their underwear. Basically, not all of them and their underwear, but you know, barefoot and with very little clothing, like as if something inside the tent had you know, was about to kill them. Okay, that's a big, big thing. It's a weird way to leave your camp. So these these guys are missing. Um and they the search party that found the tent in pretty short order. I'm not exactly sure how long it took, but from what I understand, it was the same search they found the first two bodies, and they found these first two bodies. It was the two uries Uri Kravoniashenko and Uri Doroshenko. Um the third year that stayed back, no, because they were literally three euries right, three out of tin right, Um, that's of them were Uri so um, Uri Kravanishenko, I decided again because I wanted to do better than the first time. And then Uri Doroshenko. They were found, both of them wearing their underwear. I think they were both barefoot. Um at the tree line. At the tree line they call it the big tree. It was a large cypress tree. Um. So they were in their underwear, barefoot, dead a mile down the mountain from the camp, which is where they said that they probably should have camped for more cover, so very interestingly, supposedly both of their hands were burned. I saw, yeah, I saw that they were just beaten up, and that there was human flesh found in the bark of the tree. I didn't see that at all, Okay, So as that they had tried to climb it in desperation, Okay. I did see that that they were like broken branches that indicated climbing. I didn't see there was flesh in the bark, flesh in the bark okay. Um, So maybe burned hands means like they were raw from climbing the tree. Um. But there was signs of a fire. Yeah, there was like a campfire that they had built and there were unburnt branches kind of collected by it too, right, But they were both dead and they were the first two discovered. The two juris very weird, but nothing that couldn't be a kound of or by hypothermia. Yeah, it was being out there in your underwear to begin with. It was the weird part again and like negative thirty degree weather, negative thirty with howling wins, so foreshadowing. Okay, Three more bodies, including our leader Mr dietlov Uh, They were found between those two points between the original camp and that tree, and it looked as if they were headed back toward camp. Yeah, the way they were laid out, like imagine somebody like kind of dying as they're crawling up a slope back toward camp, right makes sense to me. So let's say that they all kind of went to this tree and then they started to head out back to camp to maybe get their gear because they realized, we're in a bad spot. We're all our gears up there and we're down here in our underwear and barefoot, and why are we? Yeah again, who knows? So they found um Igor, diatlov Um, Zaneda, Colma Gorva. Why am I the only one saying their I'll say the last one rustam sloban In. Well, even Jerry could have said that one. So Rustum had a about a two and a half inch gash in his head and a fractured skull that was very weird. It is weird, but the doctor said that's not what this person died from. Again, all five of these people died from hypothermia. Even though this guy has been smashed in the head somehow. So Um, the investigators are like, okay, so far, it's weird, but something happened and then all these people died of hypothermia. Okay, yeah, that didn't hold up when they finally found the other three bodies two months later, four bodies. Yeah, in May, I think after some of the snow melt they found they found four more these in a gully down um, down slope from the tree. So there's the tree where the first two bodies were found. Up slope there were the next three bodies, like they were crawling towards back toward camp. And then on the other side, down slope of the tree, the last four bodies were found. Yeah. These This is where it gets very strange, very strange. These bodies they were they didn't die from hypothermia. They died of some very weird uh internal injuries. Some of them, um, had their skulls crushed. Two of them had a massive chest fractures and broken ribs. UM. One of them was missing her uh which one was Ludma do Nina. She was missing her tongue and part of her mouth and face. Yeah, they were. She was also missing her eyes, as was one of the other people. UM. And you know this could have been a played away. Is maybe an animal ate this stuff, but there was no outside trauma. No, when you looked at these people, it wasn't like you have been clearly hit very hard on the head was a stick or a baseball bat, or you have had your eyeballs pecked out by a vulture. Uh, no outward signs. They didn't find out until later on that all these internal injuries had occurred. Yeah, one of the really strange. It was very strange. One of the doctors who examined the bodies in the official reports said that this was like, um, there was totally out of the capability of any human to inflict these injuries. It was more like the injuries you would see from a car crash, and so they would have like crushed bones, crushed skulls, but they they would not. They didn't have any like soft tissue damage, right, Like it wasn't like somebody like kid him with an axe. But you know, they had the injuries sustained like they were hit by an x, but not the outward out external injuries like they were crushed by an axe or something. Yeah, although a lot of them were missing soft tissue, which but no outward signs of that. That's I just can't figure that one out. So we'll we'll, we'll, we'll put a pin in that missing soft tissue stuff. Okay, Okay, So there was something else that was really peculiar that has never been explained. But at least two of the bodies were found um to be like the clothing they were wearing was radioactive. Yeah, And we should point out to that some of this clothing they were wearing came off of the other people. I believe, some shoes and one of the women had parts of a wolf pants wrapped around her, so they had scavenged some of the clothes from there dead I guess, or dyeing compatriots, uh is the only thing people can figure out. And it contained radiation. Yeah, but that was the only thing that contained radiation the right. The fact they were like taking clothes from one another, that makes sense. And you can even say that the people who weren't wearing clothes, you can chalk that up to um something called paradoxical undressing, which is like found and I think something like a quarter of all hypothermia cases that you'll find the person like like stripped because something in your hypothalamus goes hey wire and you feel like your body temperature is actually rising like you're getting hot when actually it's going down. It's a weird quirk of hypothermia sometimes, so you can even say, like maybe these people actually shed their clothes purposefully, And then of course people who weren't undergoing paradoxical and dressing, we're taking the clothes and putting it on themselves. Totally makes sense. Where did the radiation come from? Why just the clothing? That is beyond bizarre and it's never been explained to any anyone's satisfaction. Yeah. And one more strange ish thing, um, not completely off the charts, but like I said, they found the camera film. That's why we have all these pictures. Uh. And the infamous thirty third frame was the last shot on this roll, which showed uh, sort of a series of white lights or a big white light against black. Could have been nothing with some weird exposure, who knows. But they had the camera set up on like a homemade tripod with the lens cap off, like facing out, as if it were like, hey, let's have this camera ready to take a picture of something that we're seeing out there. Uh. And then uh, I believe in the weeks previous to this other hikers had reported seeing um like glowing orbs and glowing lights and things like this. It was the week's previous or the weeks after. I thought it was previous. I think it was after or that there was another group that, well, this has similar sightings at that time, So who know, there was another group that was between thirty and fifty miles away basically doing the same thing UM, that reported seeing lights around the same time. So who knows. But the fact and like you said, it's not off the charts, but the fact that UM, I think it was Rustum who had the camera but didn't have any of his gear or outer outerwear, but he grabbed his camera. That is pretty bizarre. Yeah. There was an investigative named lev Ivanov. He was a lead guy, and um, he was really into this case obviously for a while. He brought a Geiger counter along that apparently just kind of spiked when he was ever around. He was the one who discovered that there was radio activity at all. Um. But they officially closed the case like a month later or something, and they said it they listed the causes of death as a compelling natural force that they could not overcome. Yeah, that's a really vague, creepy statement. Yeah, so that was that was Another thing that really raised everyone's suspicions was the investigators came in within three weeks of i think, finding the last bodies who again had not died from hypothermia, but had died from really bizarre, massive internal trauma. They closed the case on it, put it under lock and key um filed it away as classified and kept anyone from the area for the next three years, just closed off the area for three years. And it wasn't until like the early nineties that these files were opened again. And so the fact that that they had been you know, classified actually in Soviet Russia was not that bizarre. They just classified everything, But it was strange that when they declassified these things after the Soviet Union is all that they were like big chunks of these files just totally missing. So who knows, maybe they got misplaced over time. But when you add up all this stuff, the official investigation being hurry eat and then classified and then parts missing later on um that that is a little weird. It does suggest to a lot of people that the Soviet government either knew something, found something, or had some sort of role in this that they didn't want everyone to know about. Do we take another break, Yeah, all right, we're gonna come back and talk about some of the leading theories and debunk some of them right after this, All right, did we mention that two groups of people reported flying objects were just the one I only knew about one? Yeah, there were two groups of people. Uh, one that we're camping nearby, about thirty miles away, and then um other reports in that month had been reported orange balls of fire. And here's one direct quote, goodness gracious, this is in from the written testimony. One person said he saw a shining circular body fly over the village from southwest to northeast. Shining disk was practically the size of a full moon, a blue white light surrounded by blue halo halo brightly flash like the flashes distant lightning. And when the body disappeared behind the rise and the sky lit up in that place for a few more minutes. So that that's actually, I mean, not out of the realm of possibility that that person really did see that, because people have put um have suggested that these were missile tests that were they were seeing. Yeah, So should we go with that as theory Number one? Yeah, the thing is as though. UM. The guy, the lead investigator, lev levin Off, is that his name, yeah, Levi ivan Off. He said, I suspect that this is in a UM interview he gave UM. I suspected at the time, and I am almost sure now these bright flying spheres had a direct connection to the group's death. He didn't go into any more detail about that, and he he himself has died of old age. Now I believe UM. But there are a lot of people who say these weird sightings in the sky had something to do with it. Either they irradiated the group. UM. One of the things there was a twelve year old boy from their town of kanarina Berg, which was known at the time as um uh sveed lost UM that that he reported that some of them were kind of orange tanned, like weirdly tanned, UM, and that their hair was gray. So a lot of people said irradiated. They were I radiated by UFOs or missile tests or something like that. UM, you can actually kind of explain the weird tanning. And I've seen a picture of one of him at the morgue UM as they were mummified. It was probably one of the members of the group who wasn't found until May, and they were partially mummified by the by the exposure to the snow for you know, weeks or months. That was probably explained that. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, they were on the pathway apparently for what's called our seven intercontinental ballistic missile launches. But um, it just didn't hold water with the radiation only being in their clothes. Yeah, that's very weird. That's like the one thing that doesn't quite add up. Yeah. Another explanation for them becoming irradiated is that, yes, they were near a nuclear missing missile testing site and that they drank um melted snow. But again, why would just their clothes, why wouldn't they become irradiated? I don't know, or anither gear or the tent or anything what else. We got another one, and this is the most people who claim to be sensible say, this is the explanation that it was sure that it was an avalanche, That an avalanche came down the slope because they were, you know, camping out on a mountain ridge face of a mountain, um and that an avalanche came and they knew it was coming, so they cut open their tent and fled into the night and then got caught by hypothermia and died. Makes sense. I mean that would get most people, especially an experienced group of mountaineers, out of their tents pretty quick by cutting through it. Cutting through it. Maybe the thing is is it doesn't explain why some of them but not all of them, had massive trauma. And again it certainly doesn't explain the radiation at all or the missing tongue. Yes, that was another one which was never found, by the way. No, so the missing tongue I've seen. I saw that it was removed while the girl was alive. I'm sorry. Her name was lud mia um so when I saw that. But then I also saw that she had been found near a creek, and that it's possible that it had just like like basically melted away from the water the action of the water. Here's the problem, this is the official report was kept under seals for decades, and conjecture was added. You don't know at this point, who who to believe. There's so many sites out there dedicated and there's a twelve year old reporting from the funeral like that's that's the only like documentation we have of what they looked like. His name actually is um Uri Kuntsevich, another another Yuri, and he was he was that that twelve year old child. He became kind of obsessed with it, and he set up the diet lave Um Museum in the Diet Law Foundation and basically just keeps the whole thing alive and is trying to get the government to kids in the case that kid. Yeah, well so you really really stuck to it. He's really taken advantage. What else you got for theories? Well, you know that tribe, the Monsy tribesmen, there is a theory that they attacked them, um, but nothing about that holds water. They didn't have any footsteps in the snow. There were our footprints. There were peaceful people by all accounts, had never done anything like that. There was no reason to do anything like that. So just go ahead and discount that one. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. Animals attack kind of the same thing. Same. Yeah. The other thing that that the other reason the avalanche theory doesn't necessarily hold up is there wasn't necessarily any evidence of an avalanche having covered up the thing well in the tent. Yeah, it would have swept that tent away and all the gear probably right or covered it up. Yeah, what else high winds. There's one theory that maybe one of the members, maybe one of the euries, went out to pp and a win swept him away, and everyone else like ran out to look for him. But um, this article you found where they're kind of debunking some of the stuff said, you know that it doesn't make much sense that all these experienced people would have behaved this way and just ran out in their underwear. You know, it would have been a little more of a organized, sensible effort if that had happened. Yeah, you really can't. Can't um overstate that the level of experience and the combined um like the group that they formed was like greater than the sum of its parts. So yeah, they wouldn't have it wouldn't have been amateur like that. The one that and this is the kind of the new fringe e semi scientific explanation and I find just fascinating is the infrasound one. Yeah, I mean we talked about infrasound and one of our episodes, I don't remember which one. I can't remember which one, but um, this is uh, it's a phenomenon where, when, and in this area. They said that this definitely could have happened where wind collides with the mountain and the trees and everything and produces this low frequency range sound that has been known to inspire panic and dread, confusion, beer, all the things that would kind of add up in this case. Right, So there's like this really weird. Um, it's very tough to figure out whether that's actually real. Like if you look at the science, the scientific literature behind it, there's some but more often than not, it's just some somebody claiming on their website that this is real. This the literature is not necessarily there, but that's not to say that it's just totally made up. It's like, the the studies of this stuff hasn't caught up to the some of the claims on the internet. But supposedly there is from wind vortices. They could have produced it on this on this mountain, right, these little your tornadoes that would have spun up could have um produced these sounds that is below human hearing, the level of human hearing like a full octave below, but can supposedly produce these weird behaviors that make people freak out. That would explain everything. It would accept the tongue right, and I guess the injuries sure so illustrating. I've seen other ones to like, Um, there was a guy and we we need to mention him a little more. Um. His name was Simon Zelodov Zlotaryov. Man. This has been tough. His name was Simon Zelotaryov. He was thirty eight. He wasn't a member of the group. He was as he was a add on towards the end who was out there with another group that he couldn't get coordinated. So he ended up saying like, hey, can I come with you guys? And at first apparently the group was not all that happy about him being there, but from what I understand, he really kind of earned his place in there. Um. For a while, people were like, who was this guy? This is a mystery dude. Maybe the KGB was involved, Maybe he was KGB. He was definitely ex military. Um. But they and they actually exhumed him to find out if the person who was buried in his grave as him was him, and they did a they did, like a skull. They took a picture of his skull and superimposed it under a known picture of him. Supposedly it was a perfect match, but then they took the extra step of um comparing the DNA of the corpse in the grave with the DNA of a known relative, and it does not match. Okay, I saw that. I didn't know that's who that. I didn't know. He was a non Uh. He wasn't an original member of the good. He wasn't in the in the club. So that so some people are like, there's KGB was in on this or he had something weird to do with it. It was a little weird for sure. And he was one of the ones who suffered um internal broken or broken ribs, obviously internal. And he also became the editor in chief of their daily paper. It's very strange. He's like, if it bleeds, it leads, print it. Uh, you got anything else? Oh man, we could do this for hours, but now and if you have, if you're obsessed with the diet love incident, Um, we want to know what we got right and what we got wrong. Anything you want to specify, We're happy to hear. Yeah, And I think um we just officially became the three podcast to cover this topic. Hopefully we did it some justice. If you want to know more about the diet love past incident. You can type those words into while the Internet and it will give you all sorts of crazy stuff. And say, I said that it's time for listener mail. Alright, So this one is a bit long, but this is a Josh request. Oh, this one's good. It's a mystery. It is a mystery. And this is from Corey and Enjoysy City. Hey, guys, at the open of your recent episode on Tsunamis, you both expressed disbelief that the topic had never been covered. In fact, you guys both said you could have sworn you'd already covered it, and you each went back multiple times to check. Even after checking three times, you both admitted to being quote paranoid end quote that it had somehow been done before. And just like you guys, I was surprised to find out it had never been covered and began to wonder why I had fuzzy memories. So I did a little digging re listening to old episodes on similar topics. That turns out the three of us are not the only ones convinced of this existent episode. The existence of this episode Apparently the two thousand fourteen episode of stuff you should know. Josh and Chuck also believed in the existence in the Rogue Waves episode, right correct. Uh, Yes, and the September show about Rogue Waves. At about twenty minutes in, Chuck says, and I'll do this as Chuck. One of the last things we should cover, USh is the difference between rogue Waves and tsunamis. But we've already done an episode on tsunamis. And Josh, that was a great appreciate that I've been worring on it. H And at this point Josh chimes in to confirm the existence. You want to confirm it, as Josh. Uh, my name is Josh, and I'm confirming the existence of that episode. I think it's what I said roughly, I think so. And you guys go on to cover the topic quickly, seemingly in agreement that an in depth explanation isn't necessary since it already existed. Man, this opens the door to many questions. Guys, did any listeners right in after Rogue Waves to ask where the tsunami episode was Corey, I don't remember. Surely. With so many listeners who take pride in having listened to every episode of the show, someone should have noticed. I agree. Why were you guys so convinced of the existence of the tsunami episode and Son fourteen? I don't know, Corey, wouldn't Jerry notice? Well that's a no. Uh. Is it possible that the lost episode on Tsunamis was the tipping point for a sequence of events leading to a doomsday scenario and humans from the future were forced to travel back in time in order to try and expunge it from the historical record. It's possible, Corey. That's where my money is. Yeah, but why what did we say in there that was so ghastly that it could have brought about the end of humanity? I don't know. There's no way to find out either because it's been expunged by the future people. So again, Corey from Jersey City, one of my favorite places. Thanks Corey. Our our buddy John lives there. Oh no, he lives in Hollboken. Where's the Jersey City? Who shout out to John Bendell? Either way? Oh? John, Hey John? He looks at Manhattan out of his window. I know that that could be anywhere. That's true. Um, yeah, you might be thinking of Brooklyn. No, thanks a lot, Corey. That was a fantastic email, so much so I just kept pressuring Chuck to read it, and he did, and I think worked out well as we can all agree, right, Yes, thank you for reading it, Chuck, certainly.
