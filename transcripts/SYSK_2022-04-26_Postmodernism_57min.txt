Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W Chuck Bryant. Jerry's here too, and this is Stuff you Should Know postmodernism. Addition, I'm strapping on my ice skates. I know, Chuck, I was thinking about it. This may very well be the most difficult topic we've ever tackled. Is this hard for you too? Oh? Yeah, it's hard for everybody. It's hard for everyone. Yeah, No, it's very difficult. It's really hard to define. It's really easy to miss characterize things as postmodern and um lump stuff in even though it is technically that. And and and worst of all, it's really easy for people to be snobby to other people about what is or isn't post modernism. So it's yeah, it's gonna be rough. I think that's why I'm a little not nervous, because who really cares, right, it's just a podcast. But uh, just unnerved because philosophical movements, art art movements that have fuzzy boundaries. Uh, it's tough for me. Always has been ideal, a little bit more in the concrete. Uh, So it's gonna be interesting, you know, especially when you know you look at some more I don't know about cynical, but just sort of straightforward definitions of like what is postmodern art? And most people will say, like, well, it's art that happened between nineteen nineteen seventy right now. Wrong. Well, it's not wrong, it's an era. Like That's where it gets slippery, Uh, because art is defined by eras, and uh, even though people did things in the different eras that thematically and stylistically apply more to other eras. Like would you call The Godfather a postmodern film? No, but it was made in the postmodern film era precisely. So the differentiation here, then is that it begins. The differentiation here is the postmodernism that we're talking about is not just art. It's not just film, it's not just architecture, is not even just philosophy. We're talking about an entire worldview that all of us collectively share. Most of us, I should say, I think you know the West, you could say, if you want to call it that shares this this culture, postmodernist culture, post World War two, generally. Yeah, some people put it at the seventies, some people put it at the sixties, other other people even go as late as like basically, but it's not just an art movement. It's not just a type of film, it's not just a type of literature. It's it's a it's a way of looking at the world that in turn shapes how we create or exist, or live in or deal with the world. And we do it together. It's culture. But the reason it's so fuzzy chuck compared to other things is because it's it may still be going on right now, and if it isn't still going on right now, it ended so recently that we're still so wrapped up in the turbulent effects of it that it's hard to see which ways up down sideways. So it's really difficult to nail down. But it's really fun to try, I've found. And it's the kind of thing where like they probably won't put it a year marker until thirty years from now on what post postmodernism is, which we'll get to, yeah, totally, and even then it takes you know, it's not a cut and dried thing because of change like this happens over the course of a decade or two, yeah, or or more even for sure, and I would pose it that we're in those decades of change right now. We're in a transition period between postmodernism and what's next. And I think that's one reason why everything is just so uncomfortable right now, in addition to a pandemic being dropped on top of us at a really uncomfortable time. And I would also say, after reading a lot about this stuff, uh, I think art visual art, like let's just say painting. I know there's a lot more to it than that, but as opposed to literature and film, I think the boundaries there are a little more rigid than in other in things like literature and film, where they draw demarcation lines between pre modern modern and postmodern eras a little more succinctly. Like technically anything made these days would be considered postmodern art. Uh, just by the virtue of the fact that it's now, whereas you would not say a film is necessarily right right. Um, so I quit, No, you did great, We're doing great. Just hanging there, man, Just just double up the strength of your fingernails and claw in further. Okay, because I just feel the emails being typed. It's fine, you know what, we could go super postmodern and just totally ignore him like they don't exist, because what is really an email? You know what I mean? Yeah, or we could really postmodern email reply would be you know, I read your email and here's what I think and just stop at T H I N. Yeah, that's pretty great. That would be great. So, um, we're this is gonna be fun. We're talking about postmodernism and just this is one of those things where we have to define it from the outset, which is the problem with postmodernism is figuring out how to define it. And before we go any further, every hat I own right now, I'm taking off for Dave Russ, who helped us put this together. He did a great job. He did a wonderful job. Like no, I want it. Was really interested to see what he would do, and he did. He really rose to the occasion, like he did a great job. So he's he kind of started with this um anecdote about the a student of an art professor who asked his class like, you know, what, what is postmodernism? How do you define it? And um, the students said basically something that the professor later ripped off, which is, um, it's where you put quotations around everything. Yeah, it almost feels cynical in a way, Yes, a million percent, like the age of cynicism. Remember the sarcasm of the nineties. Um, you know the right, Yeah exactly, you just did it so Um, all of that, all of that is a dent the fabric, the cultural fabric of of postmodernism. It's it's as we'll see a tearing down, not just institutions and authorities and all that stuff, but other people just doing it as like just the most casual thing in the world, just tearing down. That is the cultural basis of postmodernism. Yeah, Like if someone word to talk about Andy Warhol soup cans, they can say, well, that's his truth in reality. But you would put that in quotes right with your hands at a party. You put truth in quotes, You put reality in quotes. And that's what that student was saying. You put everything in quotes, because the philosophical basis of postmodernism is that there is no such thing as universal truth, there's no such thing as reality like your you could you could, even if you wanted to be a total jerk, you could do soup and quotes and cans and quotes and Andy Warhol in quotes, right, so, and Andy Warhol would love it. He would roll over in his grave, but it would be like a dance move more than something out of agony. Yeah, so so, um, that's kind of what the what the student was saying. You put everything in quotes because nothing is There is no universal truth. And that is where postmodernism broke from its immediate predecessor, which is modernism, which said, no, there's all sorts of universal truths, and that carried on an even longer tradition of the idea that there's universal truths and we can try to find these through different ways, right, And with modernism it was like, let's not use religion, let's use reason, and it's like a post Enlightenment sort of frame of mind where we can figure out these universal truths and we can apply them to our artworks, whether it's literature or you know, uh, any kind of visual art, right right. So um, so with modern art as weird as it can seem, as abstract as it can seem. Um, what they were doing really ultimately at base followed in the tradition of like the Romanticists before them, of the Renaissance painters before them, they were all trying to move towards what's called sublime sensibility, which is this idea that there is a universal truth, There is universal beauty, there is universal like happiness, Like the nature is a universal it's shared in common to all people, exists in and of itself. And they just kind of chose a different way of going after that, rather than painting like cherubs and the most amazing clouds you can possibly come up with, you know, behind the Crucifixion of Christ or something. They tried to evoke it through those shapes and colors and abstract paintings. Um, but they were still at base after the same thing, which was uncovering that universal truth of of like beauty. Right. And then you know, I took of We talked about it before. I took a philosophy class in college that uh both blew my mind and I just didn't even understand. But I tried. I think I actually made an a in it because I tried really, really really hard in that class. Uh No, kids, I tried hard in every class, but especially hard in philosophy. But I remember studying Nietzsche and some of it hitting home a little bit, and that even though Nietzsche was for sure like pre postmodernism as far as uh An era is defined, but had these thoughts of postmodernism in that Nietzsche came along and said, you know what, it's there's there are perspectives. There is not a universal truth because we are all individuals and we all have our own unique perspective on what beauty might be or what truth might be or reality might be. So that I remember that speaking to me some more than I guess the modernist thought, yeah, because it makes sense. It's that that whole kind of thing, like what is the color green to you? It's not the same to me. Or if you look at an apple on a table, and then you move around the table, the apple changes shape. So depending literally on your perspective, you see things differently. And so what Nietzsche was saying is that if you if you take that and multiply it by however many billion people are on the planet, how can there possibly be such a thing as a shared reality? How can there possibly be such thing is a universal truth? There can't. It's just not possible because not only do people see things differently, they have different experiences in their lives that alter perception. Even more minutely, it's just too complex humans and then collectively humanity is too complex to have universal truths. And so that was kind of the basis of his perspective ism that you were talking about. And then in in turn by proxy, he said, well, then that means that all of these meta narratives, um, the stories that we tell ourselves they are they're meaningless. They can't be true either. Yeah, So it's what postmodernism would end up becoming is a rejection of modernism, and that would play out across all kinds of different kind of art forms that we're going to talk about in a little bit, but philosophically as well, because if if science and reason bring us world war and nuclear bombs, then there's gonna be I think a tendency to reject that. Yeah. So kind of like I think we talked about before, I don't remember in what episode, but that World War one was like it revealed the full horror of just putting all of your faith in science and reason that like it would lead to technology that led to destruction. And then that was followed up by World War two and the Holocaust. Um, it was followed up by things like lobotomies and phrenology and um and just mass destruction, the nuclear bomb. All this stuff came from the application of science and reason faithfully, unerringly, and so postmodernism said, you know, we need to get rid of this completely and totally. We need to tear it all down and start over. So the whole movement started out as a response, a reactionary response to the horrors of a different movement. And I think anytime you have a movement that's that's born out of um, a recoiling, a repellent response to something, it's going to be reckless. And I think in that sense, postmodernism isn't always has been reckless, because again, it's all about tearing down, and it started with tearing down all of the pillars in the golden calves of modernism. Well, reckless or free both, it's definitely both, all right. I think it's I think it's very much both because I think, you know, as we'll see later on, postmodernism ultimately led to its own horrors that we're living with today, and um, it was out of recklessness. I think. Okay, the digital age, that's part of it, for sure. Should we take a break. I think your dog says, so did you hear that it is National pet Day? Josh? All right, we're back. My dog barked again to signal us, and uh, I guess we should just go ahead and say that. The term itself postmodernism was coined by a French philosopher name Jean Francois. How how would you pronounce that? Is it leo tar, leotard or leotard? Okay? Uh? And this was in nineteen seventy nine, So you know, people put the postmodern era again with there's they're fuzzy numbers, but I've generally mostly seen sort of mid nineteen fifties to night early nineteen seventies is kind of the beginning. Uh. And so this was a nineteen seventy nine when it was actually defined by Jean Francois, who said, I defined postmodern as incredulity towards meta narratives, which you already talked about these sort of stories that we tell ourselves that sort of give structure to all of our existence. Yeah, it's like I saw it explained as meta narrative is the blueprint that we carry out like our actions and our lives, and so that like without a blueprint. A plumber just laying pipe. It's just randomly laying pipe. There's no there's no point or reason to what they're doing. But if they're following a blueprint, it gives it. It gives their work meaning, guidance, there's a purpose to it. And so meta narratives can take all sorts of different forms, from the free market is going to um, you know, deliver us all to like this prosperous, happy, progressive future, to um you know, religion explains why we're here to um. Basically, any grand story that's like the big picture, that's a meta narrative. And we've got a lot of them. And postmodernism said, not a single one of those is legitimate. Uh well, I don't know about legitimate, but not a single one of those is should be looked at as the truth. Okay, Like I think they can be considered. But but the problem I think with modernism, or at least as far as the postmodernists goes, is that they laid claim that these are the universal truths. Okay, I think that was a very important, nuanced point that You're right, I retracted my original statement. Okay, we need a ding one point that will be my only ding. I don't know, man, you've been dinging it up already. I just haven't used the sound effect. Okay, but it's you know, we talked about cynicism, it's also about skepticism, right, yeah, so I think that's part of the sarcasm, in the irony when you are sarcastic towards somebody, when you're ironic about you know, when you speak ironically about something, you're expressing skepticism that what that is is true or cool or real or anything whatever whatever it is you're you're you're saying, as long as it's sarcastic or ironic, it's it's a form of skepticism. And that that is kind of like the hallmark cultural um uh move hallmark is good. Okay, that's the cultural hallmark of postmodernism. I think irony and in skepticism and in sarcasm. Okay, I agree with all that ding ding or we need Chris Hardwick on here just to say points, Oh, that's a good one. He what's he doing these days? He could probably do that. I think he's still doing the talking dead. No, I'm sure he does plenty. Yeah, he's a brandon to himself. Yeah, he's like the Ryan Seacrest of podcasting, that's sure. He probably podcasts though, probably, But I think Chris Hardwick is still the Ryan Seacrest of podcasting. Should we talk about art like painting and stuff. Yeah, yeah, because I think we laid the groundwork here. But let's just re let's just go over this real quick one more time. Postmodernism it's a recoil, repellent response to modernism, which produced all sorts of world wars and the nuclear bomb and was based on authority figures and rigidity and universal truths. And you have to follow this and you have to look at this this way, and if if you paint a different way outside of that, it's not really art. And the art world was one of the very first outside of philosophy to kind of rebel against that, um the idea that there's anybody who could say that's art, that's not art. And one of the first people to really do that was um the data as Marcel du Champ. Yeah. So here's the thing with talking about eras of art. If you look at some of Duchamp's work in particular, Uh, we should just go ahead and reference probably one of the most famous which was what he called already made, which was to take in this case a urinal, the you know, not built a urinal, but take a mass produced urinal, signed a name on it, a pen name in the case was our Mutt Mutt and called it Fountain in nineteen seventeen. And this was a piece of art. And if you look at this piece of art, it is decidedly postmodern, but it was made what five to six decades before anyone would define art as postmodern art. And it lives like squarely in the middle. I don't know about the middle, but it lives squarely in the modern art movement. So like the difference between and I read a lot about this between modern art and postmodern art is philosophical. It's also like uh cultural and that it was mainly men who were making the art. Uh. Postmodern art really brought along different cultural perspectives and female perspectives. It was also, I read, very goal oriented, whereas postmodern art cared more about process. Apparently modern art was very very much still goal oriented. Even though they saw it as a rejection of the still life of the bowl of fruit on the table before them, A lot of the work still sort of echoed that kind of thing, and then he had du Shot coming along with his toilet, which is completely postmodern but lives in a modern era, right and and like you were saying, like he he came decades before the postmodern era in exactly the same way that Nietzsche was was laying the foundation for postmoderny and philosophy and culture decades before the postmodern era, to even further back than that. But there's just no way of looking at at Duchamp's work any other way than this is a postmodern artwork, and not just that one. The fountain like that was his like bread and butter, was using these reading mates, and that was a huge foundation of the actual postmodern art movement that came later, which was first of all, tearing down the distinction between in high art and low art, because du Schamp was a serious artist, exhibiting in serious galleries and museums and things like that, but he was also buying urinals, signing them and calling it art. So in one way that makes it like way more accessible to you and me. It makes it less scary, like arts less scary. You don't have to be an expert to come into the art world now, and appreciate art or laugh at art or take your you know, let the art, you know, um, like stop taking life quite so seriously. Um. But at the same time, it also the fact that he went and bought something, he paid for something from a plumbing supply company that was mass produced also lead the foundation for guys later like Andy Warhol, who melded consumerism into art to create pop culture, which opened the door for commoditization of art, which then opened the door for what we live in today, which is like art is advertising basically, like there's almost no distinction whatsoever. It's everywhere, and it's high jack to sell things as much as it is to to actually make art or make something beautiful or good or thought provoking. Yeah, and I don't know. I think that the transition to post modern art is really interesting because it opened it to different classes. Modern art was was almost exclusively based in Europe and in Russia, I guess, whereas postmodern art after World War two things really, I mean you could say all of the West basically was taking part, but just sort of outsider art and conceptual art and two things to where we have today. We're like, well, someone will We'll put a pile of sunflower seeds in the middle of the floor and call it art. Uh. That is that is the postmodern sort of rejection of what was already I think a pretty radical departure as far as the art world is concerned with modern art, because when you have people like Jackson Pollock or you know, uh, Picasso or Cuba stuff, there was already. Uh, I think a lot of that stuff was a little bit slower to accept from sort of the traditional you know, pre modern art critics. Right, So postmodern just blew that, blew past it. It definitely did. And then so Warhol comes along and creates pop art and everybody starts definitely riffing on that vibe. But one of the other hallmarks of postmodern art is borrowing and remixing, mashing up other styles, other types of art from different eras, different media, um, and just kind of mixing it together in a brand new way. That's one of the hallmarks of postmodern art as well. Yeah. I love that David Byrne quote Ascent because he's a sort of the quintessential postmodern musician and he he said he was all about the mashing up, in the mixing up of things and it was just sort of a really free and creative time. So he was all about it, right, Yeah, for sure. And I mean, like, especially now today the world we live in, postmodernism has like a really bad name almost across the board to everybody. But there was definitely a time where it was like glorious and beautiful and fun, and David Byrne was definitely there for that heyday, for sure. Can we talk about a couple of these other famous postmodern works. The Treachery of Images is another one. Uh, And again I think this was in the modern era technically, but it was. It was. It was one of the first seeds of what was to come. This was from Renee Marguerite and it is the very famous picture of a pipe, a smoking pipe with a caption uh in French says this is not a pipe, but what would that be In French. My French speaking friend cinep he sounded literally like the Google person on or the YouTube translator. Josh said, I did not know you had that as a as a moonlighting job. I do, and I'm making almost no money off of it, but it's still it's a labor of love. But this is a great example of what was to come with post modernism, which is, here's a picture of a pipe, is clearly a pipe, but it says this is not a pipe because perspective, baby, this is that's not my reality. There is no objective truth. Yeah, that's another thing that postmodernism kind of came along and warned everybody about, is us putting all of our faith and and just casual trust in the images and words that we've created to create our culture. Right, So Margreet was saying, and this is like quintessential postmodernism that this is not a pipe. It's a picture of a pipe. You can't trust it, you can't use it, you can't stuff it with tobacco and smoke it. Don't call it a pipe. It's not really a pipe. And um, that kind of like postmodern thought, where there was no real meaning two pictures, images, words, sounds aside from we ascribed to them. It kind of eventually morphed into this weird thing where we got really comfortable with that, you know, David Byrne idea of remixing everything, of using these different things and these different codes you create new meanings. But at the same time we were simulating reality in different ways. And so Eventually we started to lose the ability to distinguish between reality, like anything approaching what we would call like real reality and simulated reality, which was all the words and images and pictures that we just kind of take for granted are real, but actually aren't. They're all just symbols um that we've stopped seeing as symbols. And so what what postmodernism was warning about, what mcgreet was warning kind of reminding us of, ended up subverting itself and creating an inability in us here living today, to to distinguish between simulated reality and real reality. Because how once. I mean, you're a terrible example of this, but the average person out there, when's the last time you actually went out in the woods. Oh, sure, it's probably been a really long time. When's the last time you saw a video or an image of the woods into your brain you're like, oh, yeah, I've probably been in the woods pretty recently. No, you haven't. You haven't been in the woods and years. You saw it on TV last week. That's the most recent brush with the woods that you've had. That's what has been the result of postmodernism. And it's interesting that they were originally warning about it and then came to kind of throw us, throw the shackle on all of us. Yeah. I like this other example because I think this, um, I think when the people at the time might have seen mcgred's this is not a pipe, I'm sure like your average person might just say, what are you even talking about with this, or somebody might see that today and say that. But in the in the sixties, Dave found this other grade example that very much evokes that this is not a pipe, work from Joseph uh Co suits uh one in three Chairs, And I think this one is more likely to get through to someone who doesn't may not typically understand this kind of philosophy, which is it's a real folding chair, and then it's flanked by a black and white photograph of that same exact folding chair and then a placard with a Dictionary definition of chair. And I think this is a little more accessible for your average Joe to maybe come up and say, oh, I get what they're doing here, Like I might not fully understand it, but like I see what they mean. This is a chair, and this is a chair, and this is a chair. Plus it's not in French. Yeah, exactly that automatically makes it more accessible that the average How would you say that in French? Do you even though one in three chairs? Uh? Tray chairs? Is it? I haven't gotten to that on my YouTube channeling yet. Um so now I can't remember what chair is. Um, but I'll be some people are going to write in and tell us Yeah. But you know what all of this did was, in speaking in terms of like this kind of visual art is it opened the doors not only for different cultures and different people in different classes and races and and men and women and all across the gender spectrum to open up their minds and create. But it was a lot of times it was shocking, and it allowed them to really push the boundaries of what art could even be, which was a new thing. I was reading up. Do you remember the huge controversy in the late eighties it turned out to seven I didn't remember that, but um with that image piss christ, I don't remember that. It was an enormous thing. The National Endowment of the Arts got its funding slashed as a result because it turned out so this artist I can't remember his name, but he did a photo series of a crucifix in different like um, different like body fluids, like his own blood um. And this one was submerged in his own urine um. And it's actually pretty into you realize what you're looking at, and it's set a lot of Christians, including Jesse Helms off, and they went they went crazy on the National Endominant of the Arts, that artists lost a bunch of funding. Yeah, it was a big deal, and it was it brought to the fore this kind of culture clash of no one, especially not Jesse Helms can say what's art and what's not art. This artist has created something and he says this is art, it's art, and that in and of itself is a very postmodern way of looking at things. And also, you know, it turned out the artist himself is like a devout Catholic. He didn't mean it blasphemously at all. That was not at all. It was I can't remember exactly what his purpose of it was, but I don't think he meant anything to happen like it happened. But um, but even that, that's just beside the point. The point was there was there was a fight over what's art. And you know a lot of the arch conservatives won that fight by asking the National Endowment of the Arts and giving it a bad name because it's federally as a fenderally funded agency, and so taxpayer money was going into it. Taxpayers who didn't think that was art at all didn't want their money going to it. And it was quite a big kerfuffle. But it was super postmodern while it was happening, right, and they're like, what's wrong with a bowl of fruit on the table? Can't we just paint that forever? Exactly? Everyone loves the buls of fruit. How about some more of those Georgia o'key flowers. I love those for some reason I can't quite put my finger on. Oh that's funny. Uh should we take a break here? Should we talk about literature? Then take a break? Uh that's up to you. It's up to your your doggie, all right, all right, Niko says, go forward with literature. Uh, Modernist. The modernist movement with with literature featured people like Joyce and Virginia Wolf. And this is again sort of with modern art. Boundaries were being pushed in different directions from uh, sort of the old school of literary styles. All of a sudden you had stream of consciences happening, nonlinear nonlinear narratives happening is where free verse poetry was born. But then postmodernists came along and they went, oh, you think that's pushing the boundaries. Uh, let me introduce you to Thomas Pynchon and Joseph Heller and people like this who really took things to an in degree, to the point where you found that one book that just stopped in the middle of the first chapter, over and over. Yeah. There's a book by a Tallo Calvino called If on a Winner's Night a Traveler. It's from nine. It's a quintessential postmodern novel in that it's written in the second person perspective, so he talks about you, so you're the main character. And it starts out by saying you're about to begin reading it. Taalo Calvino's new novel, If on a Winter Night a Traveler. Relax, concentrate to spell every other thought. So the author is directing you, the reader, to begin the novel that you're reading. So you're immediately the character like he's writing about you in this page. And then it very quickly careens from what you would consider real, like the book runs out on page thirty two. In the book, reading still goes on. It's just in the book that happens. So now you the character have to go to the bookstore and you get another version and you end up reading ten different beginnings to the same book. But the upside of it as you fall in love with Ludmila the book the bookstore shopkeeper as well. So there's it's it just it's completely out of left field, and you could say absurd, and that is quint essentially postmodern too. They weren't James Joyce wasn't doing anything quite like that. No, not at all. And this is where I, you know, I have an appreciation for it. I think very clever. I see what you're doing there, But I would rather read a good novel to story. So that, Chuck. That is a real criticism of postmodernism is everything had, everything's meaning is up for grabs, it's up in the air. There's no universal truth. And if you if you can put meaning in air quotes as well, that that means by proxy that everything is meaningless in a certain way of looking at it. And so yeah, it's cool. That was an interesting thing and it kind of was clever um, but it is it. Is it as satisfying, is it as meaningful as, like you said, a good novel, um, you know, like an actual novel that follows like maybe a little more structural rules. Some people would say no, but a lot of people would say yes, and they would point to the idea that there's this kind of nihilistic bent in postmodernism in every form, whether it's visual art, film, um, novels, that that makes it less important in a way. And again, I personally think it's because postmodernism was born as a repellent response to a longstanding thing, and that it was immediately it was automatically borne on shaky, reckless ground, and that how can you create something beautiful if you don't think there is such a thing as beauty? How can create something meaningful if you don't think there is such a thing as meaning? And if there is no such thing as meaning, then stop writing because you're just doing that for money now at this point right, which I think was the goal oriented movement of modern art. It didn't specifically say, but what what else would the goal be rather than to have a showing and sell paintings? Yes, uh, some of the other sort of elements of postmodern literature one is paradox and randomness. Books like slaughter House five and Catch twenty two you started seeing um and even though there were non linear narratives before, you found stories that were really told out of order at this point, and that even had facts that don't align with one another, where you might say, well, that doesn't even make sense times according to what I had previously read, like even earlier in the same book or chapter. Uh, sometimes purposefully obviuskating meeting or disorienting the reader. Uh. And then this whole idea of intertextuality, which is in like sort of the mash up that David Byrne was talking about, but in this case with literature incorporating plot lines and characters from other works or other tropes in literary ideas, uh, kind of bringing them all into one book. Yeah. Like a good example of that is not found in literature but in TV. UM in the character of John Munch, who's a detective who started out as a detective on the TV show Homicide Life on the Street, and then that same character appeared on Law and Order SVU. He was a recurring long time character on that show. Right, Is it the same actor? Yes, same, same actor, same character. This is part of the same Elsewhere universe theory, Yes, yes, it's probably west Fall. Yeah, the Tommy Westfall universe. Yeah. John Munch is like one of the fulcrums of that universe because he's also been on X Files, he's also been on the Wire. Like he's this character that people like love and and love to bring into their own show, even though they had nothing to do with Homicide Life on the Street. And so that's a really good example of intertextuality. This character keeps popping up in different works and it's the same character, and in him appearing there, it's saying this show exists in the same universe as this show. And yes, you can all trace it back to the saying Elsewhere finale, which I think we talked about in our Nutso fan Theories episode. Yeah, Tarantina does that a lot too with the Vega brothers, and I think that was Red Apple cigarettes. Yeah. And there was a character in Jackie Brown that was also in uh I can't think of his name. One of the FBI guys, Michael Keaton played him in Out of Sight, But I think that was a recurring character and different without any real sort of Um, it's not like you know, Alfred from Batman appearing in different Batman movies. It's it's sort of out of context intertextuality. If that makes sense, it makes total sense. And then also Tarantino is a good example of postmodernism as far as like pastiche, which is just such an obnoxious word, but once you look into it's basically just borrowing other styles kind of in the postmodern sense, mashing them together. So Tarantino was like crazy about like seventies kung fu stuff for seventies gangster flicks, and he would he would use those. He would actually take characters who were based on those other eras in those other styles and put them all into the same movie, into the same universe together. Um, that's pastiche. And that's another very postmodern thing. Wes Anderson is another good example. His like just on paralleled love of mid century like looks and design. That's a pastiche, although it turns out he's a post postmodern director, and almost every sense of the word. Yeah, I mean, I think pulp fiction is very commonly referred to as sort of one of the hallmarks of post modern filmmaking, and that not only the mash ups, but the non linear storytelling, the good guys are bad guys. Bad guys are good guys. The sort of rejection of um of purpose, like you know, what's in the what's in the briefcase? Like that's that's a very non uh. And I think that's why I never really cared that much. But I think it's why I drove a lot of people crazy because his film goers were so trained to have to know what's in that briefcase because it should have some sort of meaning, and he was kind of turned on its ear a little bit. And then everybody copied for the next decade pulp fiction, and there were so many bad, sort of half rip offs made. Yeah, I'm not gonna say any there's one I could call out, but I'm not going to. M hm, you text it to me or something. I will, But um, have you seen Severance on Apple TV? Yeah, I'm about halfway through. I love it. It's so it's so good. That's like a good example of that leaving people wanting more and just absolutely not giving it to them like sorry, it's it's like, no, there's no resolution. It's just crazy. How how strong out you feel after after the last episode. Oh, boy, I can't wait. All right, I think we should. I'll shoot where we gotta take our second break now, Yeah, we definitely do. We'll talk a little bit more about film and sum this all up. Maybe sure, all right, we'll be right back and alright. So pulp fiction is routinely uh singled out as a postmodern film. The one that's considered probably the godfather of all of them, um is Eight and a Half by Fellini. Frederico Fellini. I've never seen it of you. Uh yeah, sure, Godfather. Not in the movie since so we don't confuse everybody. I think you just did. I think you planted that about forty minutes that you might have. Yeah, I've seen eight and a half. It's if you've taken any sort of film appreciation class in college, you're going to see it. It's Fellini's, you know, one of Fellini's masterpieces. The whole movie could be described as a metafiction because the film about making a film. Uh, it's really good. It's it's dreamy and trippy and confusing. It's full of a lot of dream dream sequences and reality and fiction are blurred. Highly recommend seeing Eight and a Half and then like reading a lot about it afterward that makes sense about it. That's when I'm my favorite types of movies is a movie that you can watch and then go find a bunch of like, um like film cript on it that that explains it or points it out, that just discusses it. I love that kind of thing. I finally saw Casa Blanket. By the way, Oh great, what do you think you know? I'm not gonna say like medium, um, it was. It was really good. I would not put it among like the best films I've ever seen or ever made, but even as a mainstream film. Yeah, yeah, I mean I thought it was really really good, but I definitely didn't see like, oh my god, this is the best film I've ever seen type of feeling. Yeah. I think it's I think people leave out that it's one of the best mainstream films ever made of the you know, first half or yeah, I guess the first half of the century or the middle of the century. I would even expand it out too. I loved it. I think it's just a great movie. But I really enjoyed it. But it was I think maybe the expectation it's sort of like when I saw it isn't Kane for the first time after so much build up. It really delivered on that as far as I think, just breaking boundaries of filmmaking and raising the bar. And I don't feel like Casa Blanket did that. I thought it was kind of just a normal, really good movie. Yeah, very normal in mainstream a good one. So um so eight and a half. It's it's like you said, it's a meta, meta narrative basically, UM. And anytime you see something like dreamy or weird or um people play themselves or strange versions of themselves, you have stumbled into a postmodern film. UM. A really good example of that is basically everything Um. Charlie Kaufman's ever written or directed. Sect senecta Key in New York is probably one of the most postmodern films ever made. But then also so it's like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But people are like just truly postmodern in every sinse But it's it checks enough boxes that you could say that's definitely a post modern film. Same with UM being John Malkovich's an adaptation. I mean, that's the currency he deals in. I still haven't seen the most recent one with Jesse Plemon's have. I gotta check that out. I'm thinking of ending things. Yeah, is that what it's called? I think so. I saw the Nicolas Cage movie that's coming out a screener good. It is very good, but it's it's very postmoderor too like Nicolas Cage plays himself, um, and it's just completely off the rails from time to time. And in a lot of ways it reminded me of Adaptation, where like purposefully goes off the rails to like make a point like Adaptation did. Um and so it borrowed from that and it didn't. You know, it's certainly seemed that way even more because Nicholas Cage is in it. But it's pretty it's pretty good. Movies worth seeing for sure. And you know, shout out while we're off track, I just saw the Nicholas Cage movie Pig oh yeah, from last year about a former chef who was a truffle hunter, uh and just trying to find his pig and stuff. He should know, listener, I believe because he was a movie crush listener. Michael Sarnowski directed that movie. Oh Nat. I've heard good things about it. It's fantastic. It's really really good. So I will definitely check it out. Then all right, let's wrap this up. I guess should we talk about I don't know, criticisms. Sure, Also we just need to definitely give a shout out. Postmodernism and architecture is also a thing. Um like it's shut Gary right, it's almost its own track. But it had an even more abrupt change than say like film or art did. Like it's just it went from minimalist functional design to just take everything apart, tear it down and put it back together in weird ways. And yeah, Frank Gary is the embodiment of the post modern starchitect is what they call him. Yeah, And I think if you want to um a good example, if you want to look at a modern versus postmodern, you can look at the two Googgenheim's from Frank Lloyd right in New York to Gary's in Spain. I was just in New York and went to the Googgenheim and saw the Kendinsky exhibit. Highly recommend going to that before it closes or anything at the Guggenheim because just being in that building is quite an experience. Still have never been Oh my god, you're kidding. No, it's the best one. It's the best Guggenheim. It's my favorite museum in the world. Yeah, because it's You're in and out in a couple of hours. Uh, it's not intimidating. You just ascend up that circular ramp and see a lot of great art over a couple of hours, and then you're out of there. And the building itself is art very nice. Wul It's like going to the met is Uh, intimidating. The Guggenheim is not intimidating. I'm gonna get super efficient and watch Pig and go to the Googgenheim in the same day. Totally should go to New York. Don't watch a movie New York, watch it on the plane there you go. I have to really select my airline carefully. All right. So, criticisms of postmodernism, like you said, it is a bit of a punching bag these days, and maybe kind of always has been. But you have people from both sides of the political spectrum criticizing postmodernism, whether it's sort of the old school leftists who think, like, no, it's has nothing to do with social progress. All this individualism is no good for our movement to conservativism, conservatism mm hmm, conservativism, which is, uh, we don't. We do not like this hole. There is no right or wrong. It's all about your perspective things, because there's definitely right and wrong. Everybody, yes, like, how can you ban a book when it's not demonstrably wrong for asserting a few points that's outside the norm, you know, a very good point. So of course they don't like the idea of moral relativism. But I was I was surprised that the leftists thought that until I learned that Leotard himself was basically like, um, yeah, there's there's this is this is a this is a strange, new, unhappy direction that we're going in, and they laid it at the feet of the failure of Marxism to kind of bring about like collective social progress. And then the response to that was Thatcher's and Reagan's um neoliberal policies that basically said, deregulate everything, make as much money as you can at the expense of whoever you need to, and let's let's go global baby um. And that is part and parcel with postmodernism as far as economics is concerned. And if you're an economist and a philosopher and you're looking at postmodernism. Probably to you late capitalism and postmodernism are basically interchangeable words. Um. And that's another reason why so many many people are so sick of postmodernism, because there isn't anything right, there isn't anything wrong, there is no truth, there is no morality. It's just just get as rich as you can is a huge part of it. To the commodification of art really kind of laid the groundwork for that, and it's permeated everywhere. Right. So now people say, Okay, we're sick of postmodernism, we think it's dead. What's next? So chuck, what is next after postmodernism? Well, I certainly don't know, but you sit along some interesting reading for me to ponder, and the general thought is that we are in in an era now of and again it won't be probably defined until ten to twenty years later. But hypermodernism, which is uh, what this article calls postmodernism on steroids, where advertising his art and where tech companies are the governments of the world or at least as influential as the governments of the world and the religions of the world, or meta modernism. Um. Which is not quite hyper moderism modernism, right, it's sort of hearkening back to modernism, yes, but with the with the um the advantage of having seen the failures of modernism before and then having lived through postmodernism. So it's this idea that there is such a thing as as beauty and truth and nature and that they are important and they matter, and there are things we should move towards, and that we should be positive and inclusive. So ted Lasso is like a cartoonish embodiment of meta modernism. And we see this this clash going on right now, chalk, Like there's a huge class in like every kind of culture war, it's between people who are saying like, no, we need to keep extracting and consuming, and other people are like, no, we need to go a different tract and like say, save the planet or whatever. And some philosophers say this is the split that postmodern ism kind of broke into. And right now we're figuring out which direction we're going to go in, you know, save the planet, uh ruin the planet, Like that kind of black and white choice is basically being laid out for us right now, and that's our place in history, and no one has any idea which one is gonna win out. Although some people say hypermodernism already has like you just we're just too much slaves to our devices, and we're like that we've just been co opted by technology too deeply already to get ourselves out of it. Other people say not so fast, including Ted Lassa. Well, all of the stuff that you sent me about meta modernism made me finally understand one of my favorite singer, country artist, Sturgill Simpson's first record was called Meta Modern Sounds and Country Music, And now that title makes more sense to me than it ever did, because he is a a country singer who sort of defies the modern country singing movement by harkening back to another time. Uh he's he's, you know, like a progressive, liberal country singer. So that doesn't go over well in a lot of circles of country music. Is that fair to say? I think so. Like when he got COVID and he was sort of speaking out about it. I was reading Fox News comments about this, and people were like, who even this this guy? He's no country star. I've never even heard of him. If you addressed him like a deer, that's because they don't play him on modern country music stations because he doesn't sing about tailgating. Uh. But his first record is called Meta Modern Sounds and Country Music, and it's fantastic. He sounds like a mashup of Whalen Jennings and George Jones. If that tells you where he's coming to? How could you go wrong with that? Exactly? With a little bit of Joan Baye is thrown in. Yeah, why not so? Uh? Surgill Simpson is possibly the future, or um bitcoin mining is the other future. It's our choice. Everybody who knows where we'll end up, but we'll find out, right. So that was posting watching the surface. Yeah we did, and that's the stuff you should know way. Uh. If you want to know more about postmodernism, there's a lot to go read about it. There's a lot to read about hypermodernism, metamodernism, post postmodernism. It's really really interesting rabbit holes to go down. Uh, you can make a hobby out of it. And since I said you can make a hobby out of it, it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna follow this up. This was about the short stuff about nose breathing and that you got a toothache from nose breathing. This is from a quote qualified dentist working in the uk UH named Tom Park. Hey, guys, I'll kind of skip the greetings for length, but he goes on to say the maxillary maxillary maxillillary, the maxillary sinuses usually referred to just as the sinuses sitting next to the nose about in the region of your upper cheeks uh, and extend to the front of your face on either side of the nose. There very close to the ends of the roots of your molars, premolars and sometimes canines, where all the nerves supplying your teeth enter those teeth. When you have sinusitis, uh, this can feel like a toothache. Even a couple of weeks after the block, no symptoms have settled, and lots of people come to the dentist around wintertime with toothaches, which is ultimately put down to this phenomenon. I had it myself once and the jog I went on was agonizing, and my empathy for my patients grew considerably. This can also occur when you read in very cold air through your nose if that air then goes into the sinuses, but it's usually more transient. I hope this helps. Perhaps Josh should check with his own dentist to see if he has cavities that need managing. Well, this was like a decade or so. Go what's the dentist name? The qualified dentist, Tom Park, Thank you tom. Um. This was at least no, this is probably more like, oh my god, twenty years ago when it happened. Thankfully, I definitely did have a cavity that needed to be filled back there. Um, But I went to the dentist recently, chuck and get this my um my dentist said that she's going to need to raise my sinus, and I was like, how do you raise a scientist? She said, well, they used to do it with the hammer and chisel. We still got the hammer and chisel, but we have a better way of doing it now that's less painful. But they used to go in and put like a chisel up under like your scientists, and then tap it and actually raise your scinus. It sounds medieval quote puelpe fiction. Yeah, I'm gonna have to because I need like a little bit of bone put back there, and they can't do it without raising the sinus. Man, I'll keep you posted. I'll be without my tooth man. What's going on with us? I don't know, like we were genetically um conferred with with terrible teeth I think. And by the way, Tom Parkossa says, by the way, also your description of the audience at Manchester you didn't clap in all the very end made me laugh out loud as a man, and Cunie and myself I can tell you that we are not easily impressed. So good on you for earning that clap and that from a dentist, Tom Park, go to Tom Park. If you're anywhere in the UK, you should make that trip to see Tom. He's got the empathy. It's right. He loves ted Lasso loves uh. If you want to be like Tom Park and right in about something we talked about. We love that kind of stuff. And somebody comes back and crosses a T or dots and I or eds an ellipse, even although we don't like the ellipses that much. Uh.
