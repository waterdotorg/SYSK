Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant that makes this stuff you should know the podcast The Addiction right, yea? How do I just realize I was giving all kinds of awesome sign language but no one can see that. I could see it just having a beneficial effect on me, pumping you up. Yeah, um, Chuck, Josh, you doing good? Great? Good, almost good. I'm great. It's Friday afternoon. Glad to hear that. Dude. You're about to go on vacation too. I am. You're probably pretty excited, right, I am very y'all even tonight tomorrow morning? Awesome? Yes, you're ready, Yes, Chuck. Yes. Do you know the economic cost for child abuse in the United States? I do, but I won't ruin it. It's massive. Let's talk about it, because you can chart anything. Yeah, it kind of money to good at that, and they're really good at that. UM. You've got direct costs like UM foster care programs, law enforcement, hospital care, medical costs, that kind of thing. Um, you've got indirect costs like funding the court system, right, loss of productivity for all the people who have to like go to be on a jury, all that kind of thing. A hundred and four billion dollars in two thousand seven is what child abuse costs the US, right, Josh, that sounds almost like more money than we spend on education in the United States. It was it was that year, well the year before. Yeah, yeah, and then interesting it's interesting and said, yeah, um, so if you have no heart, but dollar signs really makes sense to you, you can agree that child abuse is a bad thing. Right. Uh, if you do have a heart, then child abuses bad thing. Either way, it's a bad thing. Um. Child abuse, though, is not necessarily all just battering children or sexually molesting children. There's also and most of them are cases of neglect. Yeah, they have a stat here eighty six point six percent or neglect. And they surveyed some child welfare workers and is an awkward stat but it is of them estimated that about half of their neglect cases were from drug drug addicted parents, which makes sense. It does drugs. You're not going to provide care for your child adequately. Um. There's another study found that children who are born addicted to drugs, meaning that they have drug addicted parents who did drugs while they were pregnant, or drug addicted mothers at least um, those kids are two to three times more likely to be abused than non addicted children. I would argue that they're already abused, that's that's a good point, but even later on that they are much more likely to become abused, probably through neglect, because if you are like, I really need to score some crack, you're not gonna be like, but first I need to make sure my child has a healthy dinner. I gotta pump and dump before I go out and hit the streets. That's another thing too. Um. So, what we've just done, and what is not very difficult, we've connected, um, drug addicted parents to child abuse. We started out with child abuse is bad, right, Why don't we just sterilize drug addicts so they can't have any kids. That sounds like a great idea, does it? Uh? It sounds like an idea that's actually being done, is what that sounds like. And I have my dancing shoes on for this podcast because this is tricky business dude. Yeah, you can see both sides. It's the slady. Barbara Harris makes some points where I think interesting point. Plus she has some cred. Let's talk about her real quick. Barbara Harris is the founder of some thing called Commune or Children Require a Caring Community crack because community spell to the K. Yeah, that's I can't believe she stretched that. She is a former International House of Pancakes waitress who is a mother, a biological mother to six children and an adopted mother to four African American children who are born to a drug addicted mother. She walks the walk. She spent her days driving the United States in an RV promoting her UM organization, the main purpose of which is to carry out what's called project prevention, which is what we just mentioned chuck sterilizing addicts. Yeah, and we should say that her r V is not any ordinary r V. It has the whole thing is decorated with a huge picture of a dead baby, um, a line of crack, cocaine, I believe, a razor blade, and then some things just don't go together. Is the quote? Is that right? I couldn't find that one. I've I read that in a time article, I think, but Um, I saw a picture of the one that she's using in the UK, and it's a picture of a baby crying and it says, Uh, she has her father's eyes and her mother's heroin addiction. So she has a knack for getting her message out there. And one of the ways she has done that, aside from her RV, is a string of billboards in the nineties in Los Angeles that UM had taglines like don't let pregnancy ruin your drug habit. Yeah, it's gonna get some attention, yep. Or I think there's another one who's like, UM, like drugs, are you pregnant, gets sterilized? Get three bucks or something like that, which basically is like gets sterilized, We'll give you three hundred dollars in drug money. Well, there you go. That the cats out of the bag. Um, that's what we're doing there. Well, there's a lot of ways to look at this. It is a bribe too. It's a bribe to drug addicts who will in most cases spend there this money on drugs to give up their fertility. This woman is buying drug addicts fertility through her her program. Another way to look at it is that she is taking a lot of the burden off of the state. Um, who are we're going to eventually be charged with caring for these children? Were not yet conceived. Uh, And like we said, originally there were billboards, flyers, aggressive methods like hanging out at A meetings and n A meetings and basically, um, Barbara Harris's view is that if you've ever been addicted, even if you're clean, now just go ahead and get sterilized because you've kind of given up your right to have children. She doesn't see um reproduction as a right, which is what makes her very contentious to most people, very controversial thing that she's doing here. Yes, clearly, so, Chuck, how does this work? Do you know? Well, Josh, Um, it's important to point out that she will only accept someone into the program it already has one child, at least one at least one child, You're right, and Um, they the drug addict will have to fill out the paperwork and have their counselor probably social counselor or judge appointed counselor sign something that says they are in fact drug addicts, or a social work or in a rest report. They have to prove your drug addict. First off, got to prove it and then that you can either be sterilized or you can go on long term birth control. Right and um, if you go on birth control, you get two hundred bucks. You UM get a hundred up front, right, a hundred when you sign a contract that says I will do this and keep it up in a hundred after you prove that you're you're doing it, or you get three hundred bucks. Here's what they do. This is a bystander organization. They don't provide any kind of clinics where you where they perform the sterilization. Basically, what they do is say, prove to us you're a drug addict. Okay, we believe you're a drug addict. You're not qualified. Sign this contract. It says you'll go do this. Now, go do it. Get Medicaid or Medicare to pay for your sterilization programs, so you and I are paying for this pre sterilization. And then come bring us a note from the doctor that says that this happened, that proves that this procedure happened, that you're sterilized, and here's your three d bucks. And hey, if you bring by one of your crack addic buddies. We'll give you another fifty bucks if they do it. Yep, I always got to pay the referral fee. Yeah, so no strings attached except for a contract. That's another problem too. There isn't any kind of counseling now. It's just no parent classes, no parenting classes, no UM drug cessation programs. It's just here's some money to go give up your reproduction, your ability to reproduce. And since uh, it's founding, I'm sorry. Within thirteen years of its founding, UM she has worked with more than thirty seven hundred drug addicts in the United States, and about a third of those were sterilized from my math roughly the rest I guess or on long term birth control. Wow. And now she's making a way to the UK and she wants to go to Kenya for women with HIV and AIDS. Yeah. So that's pretty successful in the US, and thirteen years in the UK she's finding a much harder time of it. Um. Well, she's getting a lot more flak. Yeah, but she got support to begin with us is the reading. She went over there, some anonymous donor gave her twenty grand and she got a lot of the BBC did a special on her and she got a bunch of phone calls saying please come over here, and then the anonymous Downer came along gave her twenty grand. She says that she took that as a sign signs she started to set up in in the UK and if you go on the Project Prevention website, it says, um, there's a UK tab that you can click. Um, so she is set up in the UK, and then you also mentioned Kenya. She's getting probably the most grief of all for Kenya. Understandably. Basically, she it has decided that not only can you break the cycle of addiction by taking away the ability to reproduce among addicts, you can cure AIDS by just letting everybody who has AIDS die out and not reproduced, basically children with AIDS or hiv UM. In both cases, it depends on how who you are and how you're looking at it, because there are definitely people out there who support this, the Kenya AIDS Initiative and sterilizing addicts, because in both cases what you're looking at is uh an end do a perceived cycle where everything else is failing. It's not necessarily the case. Though there is drug treatment for drug addiction, there are drugs that can treat HIV. UM. There are also educational programs that you can teach people to to take better care, take preventative measures. This lady is not interested in that and in the I mean it's a part of the state, the government medical program here seeing well, yeah, I guess you can get birth control for free. Here came Medicaid Medicare. That's how this thing is functioning. Addicts go get these procedures or their birth control for free, for through texpayer funding programs like medicaid medicare, and she's given them three bucks. Um, just go talk about Kenya for a second longer. Did you look at that? Uh? Now, I didn't look much into it. Actually, she found a doctor who said that he'll he'll insert i U d S, which is long term birth control, but it's temporary, it's reversible, for seven bucks a pop. And then her organization will pay UM women with HIV AIDS UM forty bucks for it. So forty seven bucks a person. She's just buying their reproductive abilities in Kenya. There are a lot of people who are frustrated by that. I'm sure. So Chuck, how is any of this legal? Well, Uh, Planned Parenthood is one organization that says, you know what, this is possibly illegal. Uh if you're talking contract law, because there's something when you have a vasectomy or any kind of sterilization that says, uh, informed consent, like you have to be in there of your own free will. It's not h Daddy isn't out in the car forcing you to go in and get your tubes tied. That kind of thing. Um they basically you're saying that you know this three d bucks is coercive, it's a bribe, and it's not informed consent going on. No, because if if, if there's a bribe involved, Yeah, you can't, like informed consent can exist medicaid in medicare requires informed consent. But here's the loophole. The informed consent has to be between the patient and the provider. Project prevention is a third party and interested third party who is really not involved in that equation. And the court protects the lady going into get her tubes tied. Yes, And the court's protecting the lady who's paying the US and to go get their tubes tied. Because this is even though like it's it's um extremely unethical and immoral in some people's eyes. It is still technically illegal because the provider of the sterilization services not giving this this person three d bucks. Someone else's here too. Of her arguments which made me at least sit back and think for a minute about what the heck is going on here, because this is, like I said, this is a narrow line this lady's walking, so I might say she's way way over it. Uh. One of the arguments used against her is that these um women are not in their right mind to decide to have this procedure done. They're on drugs. You're given him this money. So her argument back is so they're not of sound mind enough to have this procedure, but they're of sound mind enough to decide to have a kid. Yeah, it's a good argument. Her other big argument is against her is that you're taking away a woman's right to choose to have a baby essentially, and her are gim and reverses, Well, why is that right more important than a child's right to be born into a normal environment and have a shot at a normal life. So I believe that she is not necessarily trying to create some pure race of smart white people. I think she is trying to stop crack babies from being born, but she's doing it is definitely stirred the pot. The impression I have is that even this lady's critics are UM say that she's a true believer. Yeah, she's not, Like, she's not a social engineer. She doesn't see it like that. The problem is is, like I think a lot of people are worried about where she's getting her funding. UM, her largest donor apparently UM. Crack and Project Prevention have about five thousand dollars a year in operating budget ok UM, which I guess is enough to fund to fuel the RV around the country and keep the website going and pay as many addicts as possible. UM. But most of that money is coming from a guy who is a billionaire named Richard Mellen Scafe. Right. I hadn't either, but he's apparently UM on the right right hand of the spectrum politically. Yeah. He runs the Pittsburgh Tribune, which is a right wing newspaper as far as its leanings UM, and he The idea of a billionaire funding a project like that scares the tar out of people because it gives it a classist, um bent. Even if this lady is a former eyehop waitress, if the people who are giving her the money to do this indefinitely are billionaires, then what what you're talking about is how one person put it. Um, you have a structure in which the economically privileged can and do dictate who will and who won't have children end quote, which means you're you're on crack, or you're black, or we've decided that you're unfit to reproduce, but instead of forcing it, we're gonna pay you. But really, what's the difference. Yeah, I mean, it's a nonprofit quote unquote, but a nonprofit funded by a billionaire. It's different kind of nonprofit, you know what I'm saying. Another criticism is um that it is racially disproportionate. Um. She will point out that a thousand clients were African American, whereas more than eight hundred have been white. But Um, as far as percentages of population goes, it's it's skewed heavily towards blacks. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense if you I mean, in hard numbers, it's like, well, there's way more white people than black people who have taken part in this. But if you look at the proportion of the population UM, seventies something percent of the US population is white, whereas only like about thirteen percent is black, So those numbers actually are very disproportioned new UM and also the original billboards targeted low income, predominantly African American areas of Los Angeles at the beginning. UM. I think ultimately what scares people is that even if this is an addicts choice, even if you agree, this addict is making their own decision, and in some cases there are UM. In this time article, there's a woman named Joe and Chavarria, and she's just like this model participant. There's a quote from her that said, like when you stop having kids, that makes you think about what else you can do in life. She already has five kids, the state has custody of them. She got sterilized and took her three hundred dollars and bought Easter presence and educational toys for her children, who she's trying to get back. She already had three kids, and then she gave birth to two drug addicted twins because she was addicted to meth um. She started doing math at eight months pregnant. Yeah, which is not a good time to start doing myth start. That's a particular bad time to start. I would agree with that. Um. Yeah, so she's a poster child. She is. But even if she's walking around, right, the the whole idea that that reproduction in reproductive rights should and could be controlled by other people, whether they're a private organization funded by a billionaire um or the government smacks of the eugenics movement. We've already done this before and it's it proved horrific. Right, we need to talk about eugenics, we definitely do. Let's do it well. Remember it came up in the Crimes Them Photography, Uh our podcast? Right, Yes, it was a big deal in the US. Yeah. When did it start? Night? Turn of the Century night, early early twentieth century. Eugenics was a movement a concept that you could create a fitter human species if you removed undesirable traits UM like chronic disease, UM, low socio economic status. Do you want to hear with this this model law for eugenics. Yeah, we'll say what the model law is first. Who was it that came up with that? A guy named Harry Laughlin? Um. He was the head of the Eugenics Record Office, and I remember at the time in the the um this was nineteen fourteen that he came up with the Model Law. There was this idea that, like you said, Chuck, you could create a fitter human race by basically weeding out the undesirable elements and we just letting the healthy, robust ones reproduce. Simple as pie, you get yourself a nice arian race boys from Brazil, right, Um, So to to carry this out. Most people who are unfit don't really consider themselves unfit, and even worse, in a lot of cases, Um, one of the sure signs that they are socially unfit is that they're sexually promiscuous. So you gotta take matters into your own hands. And the government has to force sterilization through the courts and not just formiscus. Should we read out some of the things in the law. Well this these are the undesirables, take it, Chuck, the feeble minded, the saying, criminalistic, the epileptic, the inebriate, the disease, the blind, the deaf, the deformed and dependent and orphans, near do wells, tramps, homeless and pauper's The only thing I don't see in here is skullduggery. Right, I'm surprised that's probably in here somewhere. Actually, So that was the model law for UM forced government mandated sterilization. You know, people who are targeting. Yeah, this is the US UM. And by this by the time this model law was created, UM, a couple of states already had their own compulsory sterilization laws based on the idea of eugenics. Right. I think Indiana and Connecticut were hot, hot on, hot on the trail. Yeah. California came fairly late to the game. UM. In the early to mid twenties, they had a law. But by that time, by UM, hundred of the three thousand people who had been forced to be sterilized under this law UM or in California. And one of the ideas behind it was that it was a tax saving measure. Right. The really interesting considering today's it sounds very familiar. UM. The U. S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes very famously said something that might also sound familiar as far as logic goes. UM. He said, quote, it is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility. Society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. And he finished up, and we'll talk about this case. Was saying, three generations of imbeciles are enough. He's talking about Carrie Buck. And she was a seventeen year old in Charlottesville, Virginia. She was the first person chosen to be sterilized in Virginia under the Dow Model law. She had a kid, but was not married. Her mother was in an insane asylum called the Virginia Colony for the epileptic and the feeble minded. It's not a place you want to visit and not leave. Uh. And here's her story. She was um picked because they thought that she shared hereditary traits with her mother, a feeble minded, feeble mindedness, and sexual promiscuity. Uh. They thought it was genetic. She already had one kid, and they thought, you know what, it's probable that she's gonna have a socially inadequate child after this, and let's sterilize her. Let's make her case number one in Virginia. Took her. They went to court. Um, it went all the way to the Supreme Court. Um, people testified against her that she had a record of immorality and uh, syphilis, prostitution, and untruthfulness. So the judge said, okay, let's sterilize her. And it was upheld. And it was upheld because that Oliver Wendell Holmes decision, that quote came from the majority opinion that yeah, we should go ahead and sterilize this girl. And she was sterilized. But what happened, Josh afterwards, Well, what we her kid was studied UM tremendously. This was not like, uh, there was popular, widespread support for eugenics in the US, but there are also plenty of people who are like, what are you doing? This is the worst thing we've ever done. Um. So her kid, UM, Vivian Buck was UM was followed her. A lot of stuff was not entered into the public record when during carry Buck's trial or hearings. UM. For one, she wasn't promiscuous. She was raped by her foster parents relative right, um. And then Vivian was not a an example of a third generation feeble minded person. She was a solid beast student apparently and was on the honor roll. UM. That was her first grade report card. So basically this woman was the the test case to keep seralization going or to really get it going, proved fraudulent in the end. Well not only that, but her defense lawyer, it turns out this was later uncovered, conspired with the lawyer for the Insane Asylum to guarantee that would be upheld. So it was completely fraudulent. Uh, but it was upheld in Virginia and eight three hundred Virginians were sterilized after that Buck versus Bell case eight thousand, three hundred. UM. Harry Laughlin, the guy who was running the eugenics record office and who wrote that model law in nineteen fourteen. He went on to get a mob um a medal from the Nazi government in nineteen thirty three for um his his contribution to the science of racial cleansing from the University of Heidelberg got an honorary degree. And UM, I didn't know this, but apparently the Rockefeller Foundation funded the German I can't remember with the name of the the research facility, but funded the German res for search facility where this was being born. Over there where is Mingla is that is that the Guy Rockfeller Center was funding them at the time too. And then Nazi says, this is a great idea, and we'll go on to sterilize thy thousand people. And it turns out that's not even enough, so we're just gonna start killing them. Right. So, if if you start people to say, like, oh, what could something ever lead to, you never know what it could lead to. Well, in the US, in the United States, UM, it led to a thirty three states with compulsory sterilization laws on the books that continued into the nineteen seventies. We were sterilizing the mentally retarded in the US. I was alive, I was born, and this was going on UM and ultimately about sixty thou people lost their ability to reproduce UM at the hands of the US government. UM. And this the guy who wrote this great paper, he's actually a pretty much an expert on the eugenics movement in the US. His name is Paul Lombardo. He's a University of Virginia professor. UM. He points out that the Carrie Buck case that basically allows compulsory sterilization of feeble minded people is still on the books. It's not overturned. Yeah, but it's one of those it's not you couldn't do it today, But wouldn't it be interesting if that came up and somebody when somebody ultimately challenges project prevention. I have a list of people who supported eugenics. Are you going to call him out? And this is not to say that they supported sterilization, because eugenics had a lot more to do with It was broader than just sterialization. But Woodrow Wilson, uh Margaret Sanger, who is the founder of Planned Parenthood, who was a lightning rod her self in her time, and now Planned Parenthood is criticizing Barbara Harris, which really says something. Oliver Wendell Holmes obviously we mentioned him. H. G. Wells, Teddy Roosevelt, John Maynard Keynes, and George Bernard Shaw are just a few who thought eugenics was pretty good idea at the Charles Lindbergh did you see him? No? No, no, was he in there? Remember he was all about Darwin and Limberg. Really I didn't know Limberg was in there. It wasn't that one article you sent me. No, that was for trans humanism, right, but it was for certain people it was based on genics. So Chuck Um, like you said, you had your dancing shoes on, and I can appreciate that. Should we talk about Jack Skinner real quick though, or do you want to? Well? Yeah, because that was when it was actually struck down in two Oklahoma criminal Um. They were going to start sterilizing criminals or they had been already probably right, repeat criminals, repeat criminals. And he was a chicken thief and uh an armed robber. And this went to court in justice William ou Douglas struck it down and had a very good point. He said, you're not gonna essentially I'm paraphrasing, you're not gonna sterilize at three time in Besler, all right, but you'll sterilize a chicken thief. So it comes back to class once again. Yeah, and then then that's where we are again. Um again, you did a good job with your dancing shoes. I'm dancing nice. Um. Depending on how you feel about it, this isn't going anywhere. This lady has been doing this for thirteen years and it first got attention, like right when she first started doing it. She gets attention every once in a while. I just heard about her, like a couple of months ago. I reckon if you've seen that RB around town, you'll pay attention. Yeah, and if you're in the UK, lookout for it because they're um, they're already investigating her people um for very aggressive tactics. Apparently this woman came out of a clinic with her kid and one of the Project Prevention people ran up and was like, hey, how would you like three hundred pounds to be sterilized or two hundre pounds to be sterilized? And she's like what, she wasn't a drug addict? Yeah, which because a tremendous amount of offense and now there it's being investigated. I'm wondering what kind of um reception shill ultimately have there. And she's got her sights on Australia next. So Project Prevention sterilizing addicts the answer to the question. Technically, yeah, it's legal reeks of eugenics. Yeah, but that's not illegal, that's right. And apparently you can go out and compulsor really sterilized a feeble minded person as long as you can provide that they were feeble minded. You know, we should do some podcasts on some like awesome things that America has done. I feel like we're always dredging up these awful things that we did in our past history. But people, a lot of people don't know. I was never taught about eugenics in high school. Oh no, neither was I. I don't know, but that didn't know we sterilize sixty people. But I think that's why we have to do this sometimes, Chuck, because we know a lot of the good stuff. You're right, we do need to come up with some great, awesome off to talk about two. But I think people generally think that way, and I think that a lot of this, the dirty, nasty stuff, just gets covered over and it can't can't because we're in the midst of a case of history repeating itself. And if we don't talk about it, if people don't know about it, then if you don't have the luxury of hindsight or to make an informed decision, hazza to that, sir, So uh uh Sterilized Addicts will bring you the article which we just pretty much did to death um. But if you want to see some pictures of heroin UM and a methodicted couple with their child, you can type in uh sterilized addicts at the handysearch bar house that works dot com which means it's time for listener mail. Not so it is time for uh what do we call it? Administrative detail and breaks on. That was a really good break sound chuck, Thank you, quick announced and everyone. We are coming to south By Southwest in Austin, Texas. Uh, you need a badge to get in to see us. We're even doing a live podcast. You need a gold or platinum level interactive badge. I think it's a Krypton level kryptonite. No it's not. But we're gonna be podcasting live regardless at the Drisco Hotel eleven am Monday, March fourteen, and we'd like you to come down and see us well podcast and then do a little Q and A. Plainly, we would like you to come see it. So it just come see us. What you what's your problem? It gets your hands on a badge, you can do it. Yeah, just take quick. Most of the people wearing the interactive badges are going to be pasty, maybe a little weak. Just get a badge, yeah, exactly, and we'll see you there all right, back to it, Yeah, okay. We like to take time every couple of months to thank people who send us gifts in the mail because it's a real nice thing to do. Sometimes people are plugging their little Etsy site.
