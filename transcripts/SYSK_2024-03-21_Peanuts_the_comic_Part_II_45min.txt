================================================================================

00:00:01
iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:11
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the Peanuts Cast. I'm Josh, there's Chuck been sitting in and this is part two of two the Deuce, as we call it sometimes, about stuff you should know about Peanuts.

00:00:24
iHeart Intro: That's right. If you remember where we left off, Charlie Brown had just murdered Snoopy and was on the run from the law. No, of course not. We had made up and surely no one's going to listen to this one first, but just to catch you up, we covered most of Charles Schultz's early life, the birth of Peanuts, and we had gotten up to Snoopy character wise, and here we go with that little black and white beagle that is probably the weirdest comic character of all time.

00:00:55
Josh: Yeah, and we said before he was based on Schultz's dog Spike, who apparently could eat razor blades without getting sick. He had another dog, know that. I guess Spike ate razorbikes And they were like, oh, okay, he's good. That's what he was in Ripley's believe it or not, for eating razor blades, yeah, not getting sick. He had another another dog named Snooky. Snooky and then just like the Jersey short character. And then apparently his mom suggested that as she was dying that if the family ever got another dog, they should name it Snoopy, like s n Upi, which apparently is a term of endearment in Norwegian. So you put all those together, you mix them up, put him in a blender, blend it, and then regret that immediately you've got Snoopy.

00:01:45
iHeart Intro: Yes, Snoopy was a black and white beagle who slept on top of a doghouse. Yeah, apparently that came around in fifty eight. For the first few years, Snoopy actually slept in the house and if you wonder why Snoopy, he was on top of the house so you could see Snoopy right. Very weird to have a cartoon drawn inside of a doghouse, So it was just sort of a utilitarian decision. Snoopy was, like I said, one of the weirdest character in comics, I think, because Snoopy had and my favorite thing about Snoopy was this weird fantasy life that Snoopy lived where he had these alter egos. I think there were more than one hundred Snoopy alter egos that range from being a world famous it was always world famous, usually a world famous tennis star. He was a world famous surgeon, an attorney. The Fierce Vulture is one of my favorite alter egos, a famous, world famous author. Joe Cool was one I wasn't super into. Actually, it was probably my least favorite altar.

00:02:51
Josh: That's funny. My grandma called me Joe Cool because I sent her a card once as a kid and identified myself. I think I signed it as Joe Cool. It really called me Joe Cool from that moment on.

00:03:03
iHeart Intro: But the really weird one was the Flying Ace alter ego, in which Snoopy was a was an air airplane fighter pilot from World War Two that had an ongoing I was about to say beef, but just ongoing battle with the Red Baron fighter pilot from Germany, and that became a big hit song in nineteen sixty six. It was a novelty song by the Royal Guardsman that hit number two in the United States, Which is I mean I had this forty five that It was a time and we've talked about some famous novelty songs in the past, but it was a time when a novelty song could be like a legit number one hit.

00:03:44
Josh: Yeah, or number two at least. Yeah. So that flying Ace thing. One of the things that Peanuts is known for is it was genuine, generally not political. It was much more universal than that. It wasn't so narrow as to like discourse on politics.

00:04:01
iHeart Intro: Right.

00:04:02
Josh: But during the Vietnam War, and Charles Schultz, remember he was a veteran of World War two, very proud veteran, and during the Vietnam War he gave official approval for the Air Force to use Snoopy as a mascot in Vietnam. And at the same time, as it became clear that the United States strategy and involvement in Vietnam was just a catastrophe and disastrous and being led by people who were completely amoral, even Charles Schultz became dissatisfied or against the Vietnam War, and he used the World War one Flying Ace to comment on the Vietnam War like there was it went as it became as overt as there's there's one where Snoopy as World War one Flying Ace has cursed the stupid war, and eventually it even spilled out from the flying Ace. There's there's strips where Lioness and Charlie Brown are discussing the prospect of being drafted. I mean, like he got pretty anti war as a matter of fact during the Vietnam era, which was really out of character for not just him but also for Peanuts. But like that, I think that just kind of goes to show how unpopular the Vietnam War was that even Charles Schultz, this conservative methodist World War Two veteran, was speaking out against it through his characters.

00:05:26
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think Franklin's dad was in Vietnam during the comic strip exactly. Yeah. And by the way, I think I said world War two instead of World War One.

00:05:35
Josh: So in choke correction, Oh did you say too? I'm sorry I didn't correct you. I really know that I missed the chance. Hey, you mentioned Joe Cool. There was an offshoot of Joe Cool from the nineties, wasn't there.

00:05:49
iHeart Intro: I don't know was here.

00:05:50
Josh: Yeah, you gotta gotta mention Joe Grunge.

00:05:53
iHeart Intro: I wouldn't run for Joe Grunge.

00:05:55
Josh: I wasn't either, But I mean, I'm aware he existed.

00:05:58
iHeart Intro: I wasn't aware he existed.

00:05:59
Josh: Well, now.

00:06:01
iHeart Intro: That's good. Sounds like he rolled with the times. So Snoopy had a family. We mentioned Spike. He had a whole litter that he was born with, Spike, Bell, Marbles, olaf Andy, Molly, and Rover, and Spike was the one that I love. Spike became he became like arguably a main character in the in the nineties basically, but he debuted in nineteen seventy five and was you know, he always had that hat on, and he had those whiskers that sort of looked like a little beat nick mustache. Yeah, and he lived alone in the California desert and he was usually by his big cactus, and it was just he was he was sort of an altar of Snoopy like in demeanor.

00:06:44
Josh: Yeah, yeah, for sure, but Snoopy. It's not like Snoopy was high strung or uptight. He was different. They were very different, though, But I'm not sure how one was a foil to the other. I think they were just different, you know.

00:06:57
iHeart Intro: Oh, I don't think there were foils. I think yeah, And I think Snoopy, I mean, I think he was precocious. But again, it almost felt like a spin off within the old thing, within the within its own thing, because he and Woodstock were commonly you know, I mean He would interact with the other characters, but he was often doing his own thing, right.

00:07:17
Josh: Yeah, like you said with Woodstock, do you I have a question for you. When you were going up? Did you have the Snoopy snow cone machine?

00:07:24
iHeart Intro: I did you, lucky kid, I'm pretty sure either that or a friend did. I can't remember.

00:07:30
Josh: That stuff was addictive, those those plays fun. Yeah, same here. I had access to one, but I had to like go play at somebody's house to get a Snoopy snow cone.

00:07:40
iHeart Intro: I don't think that. Maybe I didn't have one, or if it was, it was a hand me down. I know one thing for sure. My parents didn't go out and buy me that thing new right.

00:07:49
Josh: They got it out of the yard sale and it hadn't been washed out from the last time. Probably, So there's I got one other little piece of Snoopy trivia, all right. Snoop Dog he was nicknamed by his mom because she thought that he looked like Snoopy as a young man.

00:08:07
iHeart Intro: I could see that totally on.

00:08:09
Josh: Once you hear it, you're like, oh my god, he does kind of look like Snoopy.

00:08:13
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's very cute. Yeah, I agree, And Snoopy the Dog loved smoking some wheat.

00:08:20
Josh: I don't know. I think that might have been Woodstock, who I say we talk about real quick, you want to sure?

00:08:25
iHeart Intro: I mean Woodstock. We talked a little bit about Woodstock in the Woodstock episode because Woodstock was named for Woodstock. Because June twenty second, nineteen seventy is when Woodstock the bird got its name. I think it he was around in the cartoon before that but didn't have a name, And there were other birds in the cartoon that preceded Woodstock.

00:08:46
Josh: Yeah, and when they finally debuted Woodstock's name, it's Snoopy hanging out on the roof, and I guess Woodstock had been around for a while. And he said, Harry thinks I finally found out what that stupid birds name is. You'll never believe it. And apparently it was absolutely based on Woodstock.

00:09:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:09:06
Josh: And there is a an author named Michelle Abate who wrote a book on Charlie Brown and like analyzing Charlie Brown, Blackheads, Beagles, and sweet Baboos, New perspectives on Charles M. Schultz Peanuts, where Michelle says like Woodstock represented the younger generation, like hippies, like straight up hippies, that's what Woodstock represented. They were Woodstock was a like innocent and naive and just kind of childlike and having fun and doing doing their own thing. And then like even more r Kinley, the fact that when Woodstock spoke, the only person that could understand Woodstock was Snoopy and the reader can't. It's just these little kind of chicken scratch lines.

00:09:50
iHeart Intro: You remember that, yeah, or Woodstock scratch.

00:09:54
Josh: So Michelle Obate makes the case that Charles Schultz, in some way, shape or form, is making commentary on how the older generation can't understand the younger generation. But for him that was just kind of like an unusual, an unusual nod, a kind nod to the younger generation to a lot of people his age and from his his his political bent, didn't think very highly of but apparently he did.

00:10:23
iHeart Intro: All right, that's one of those that's like what I was taking English classes in college when I was like, okay, yeah, if you say so.

00:10:33
Josh: It's analysis, it's interpretation, like yeah, all that stuff. You can make a pretty good case for it. You can also you could also say like it's almost like a fan theory.

00:10:44
iHeart Intro: Yeah, well I think it's for sure is. But that's just what commentary is, right.

00:10:48
Josh: I think, well, it's a fan theory in an academic book form.

00:10:52
iHeart Intro: Yeah, exactly. That's the only thing that separates fan theory from just printing it in a book or typing right. Right.

00:10:59
Josh: But suppose there's one other thing more than once Snoopy refers to Woodstock as a hippie bird. Yeah, did that persuade you even further?

00:11:11
iHeart Intro: No? No, no, I didn't think he wasn't non hippie, but the whole like the generational chicken scratch representing like I'm just not sure about that.

00:11:20
Josh: Okay, I gotcha, But I love it.

00:11:22
iHeart Intro: I love talking about that stuff. I do too, So do you like talking about Peppermint? Patty and Marcy love it? A lot of people love it because a lot of people it's sort of, you know, has become one of these burdon or anythings where they're like, hey, listen, Peppermint, Patty and Marcy are clearly gay young girls who just maybe don't know it yet, and there's always been you know, fan speculation about about that. And I think you know, that's fine, that's all well and good. Charles Schultz himself was interviewed in nineteen ninety seven and said that, you know, he understood that people talk a lot about that, but he said sexuality to him just wasn't relevant to the comic because they were just children. And that's not to say that a child, you know, can't be gay, but he was like it was the kind of thing that didn't enter his mind. I don't think he was like offended or thought it was weird that people would speculate about that, But it doesn't sound like that was his bent when he drew this very sort of classic tomboy character who was very good in athletics, who was called sir By Marcy, which was always very funny to me. But either way, two great characters. One of the favorite things for me with Peppermint Patty was how she would invert names. She called Charlie Brown Chuck. She did the opposite for Lucy. She called Lucy Lucille. I think at one point maybe it Schroeder calls her Patricia, which was a little spin on that. But that's just a fun little character thing that I always really enjoyed.

00:13:00
Josh: I always loved Peppermint Patty's voice in the TV specials.

00:13:04
iHeart Intro: Yeah, same, it was perfect.

00:13:07
Josh: Yeah, So there was a little strip or a little period of strips where Charles Schultz, who had by this time befriended Billy Jean King, as Title nine was being passed or was being discussed whether it should be passed or not. Which was which allowed equal or demanded equal funding for women's sports? And I guess just college, right.

00:13:33
iHeart Intro: I'm pretty sure it was just college and there was more to it, but I think it was about equal opportunities and funding for college athletics.

00:13:39
Josh: Right, which is nuts because we're talking about the nineteen late nineteen seventies. Isn't that crazy? But anyway, Billy Jan King, who was a champion tennis star, was also a champion of Title nine, and being her friend and supporter, Charles Schultz drew some Peanuts strips basically using Peppermint Patty as a stand in. And a lot of people are like, see, Billy Jean King was gay. She came out in nineteen eighty one, so of course Peppermint Patty was and that's what Charles Schultz meant. But no, he was using her as a stand in for a woman athlete, as Billy Jean King was. And in that strip they're talking about how Peppermint Patty is going to show all the men that she can do anything they can do, and maybe even better, and she's great at sports. And then I think somebody asks Lucy, who's standing there, what she's going to do because she's no good at sports, and Lucy goes speak out so loud that Charlie Brown is doing like a summrsault mid air. And that was just perfect because you had Peppermint Patty, you had Lucy doing her thing, and then you had Charlie Brown kind of standing in for the bystanding rest of us, who are now going to be moved by the by the arguments in favor of title nine.

00:14:51
iHeart Intro: Pretty cool, amazing, So some more Peppermint Patty stuff. She was one of three characters who did not go to the same school as the rest of the Peanuts gang. Peppermint Patty and Marcy and Franklin lived unquote at the other side of town, so they sort of represented They never came out and said it, but they represented not poor children, but it was definitely the other side of town type of situation, like they had broken homes, they were they didn't get to go to the same school. I remember when Franklin visits visits Charlie Brown's neighborhood for the first time, he sees the psych booth, he sees snoopy on the house, and the great Pumpkin has talked about and he leaves the neighborhood and say to go home, and said, this neighborhood has me shook. So it was definitely like a demarcation line for Marcy and Franklin and Peppermint Patty. And also Peppermint Patty her mom was, I guess dead, like they never said, she said, but she said, my mom's not around. Oh really she lived. Yeah, she lived with her father only, which was a very different thing for a comic back then. And one of my favorite things is even though we never hear parents speaking to things, there are references to things parents say. And Peppermint Patty's father always called her a rare gem, which I thought was very sweet. It is sweet because she wasn't very smart.

00:16:24
Josh: So yeah, Peppermint Patty was. She was groundbreaking in a lot of ways in that. So, yeah, she was a tomboy. She her she was the daughter of a single parent, her child of a single parent, and then on top of that, she was one of the first comic strip females who didn't who like made her own way, Like she didn't need a man. She wasn't there to support the man like Blondie did, Dagwood or anything like that. She was just her own person, making her own way by her own terms. And that was another groundbreaking thing. I think she came along in nineteen sixty six and people hadn't done that before.

00:17:01
iHeart Intro: Yeah, she had a crush on Charlie Brown, as did Marci. Marci was very soft spoken and shy. She was very smart. In fact, she's the one I think that points out, like I feel kind of bad for Peppermint Patty because she was written so unintelligently. Yeah, like her teacher gave her a plaque at one point for being in the D minus Hall of Fame. Yeah, and she didn't realize Snoopy was even a dog until nineteen seventy four. What when Marcy pointed out She used to say he was a funny looking kid with a big nose. So they write her really like not very intelligent. And I always felt bad for Peppermint Patty, but Marcy was always her loyalist friend. I don't know if I said, but also had a crush on Charlie Brown and my favorite cute thing ever because Marcie was the opposite of Peppermint Patty. You know, she was smart and she was not good at sports, whereas Peppermint Patty was the jock, and Marci called the Super Bowl in one comic the Splendid Bowl.

00:18:00
Josh: She is pretty great. She didn't have a last name. Peppermint Patty's last name was Reichardt. Marcy never had a last name, and some people said that the reason why is because that allowed her to be just kind of this whatever Charles Schultz needed her to be or say or do. But I think very quickly Marcy's character took over and probably constrained Charles Schultz in a lot of ways because she was just a weird little kid who had just her own set of understanding of the world that didn't really fit with anybody else's. It was just totally hers. And like I said, Charles Schultz was once asked like, why does Marcy call Patty Peppermint Patty, sir? And apparently his response was, I have no idea. Marcy's a very strange little girl.

00:18:54
iHeart Intro: Again, he's a condo it I mean, it wouldn't surprise me that just popped into his head.

00:18:57
Josh: Yeah, for sure. And I hadn't realized this, but a lot of Asian American kids took Marci to be Asian American.

00:19:04
iHeart Intro: Weird.

00:19:05
Josh: Why, I don't know. I'm not sure. I guess, I don't know. Maybe I don't know. I have no idea, but I saw that in several places.

00:19:13
iHeart Intro: All right, well, that feels like a good time for a break. Oh yeah, sure, all right, Well we'll come back and pick up with Franklin, one of my favorite characters, right after this.

00:19:39
Josh: Softly jaw.

00:19:44
iHeart Intro: Soft all right. We mentioned Franklin before is when it being one of the only three that didn't go to the same school, lived in a different neighborhood. Franklin is very famous, obviously for being the first black Peanuts character, and that happened for a very purposeful reason. In nineteen sixty eight, there was an LA school teacher named Harriet Glickman who wrote a letter to Charles Schultz. This was just after Martin Luther King Junior had been assassinated, and she said, you know, we need to overcome quote the vastie of misunderstanding, fear, hate, and violence, and I think you should you should draw a black character for Peanuts. I think that would be a big step forward, in a big move. And Chultz initially declined, and it wasn't because he didn't want to, but he said that he thought it might be sort of to patronizing a move, but then thought the better of it after you know, a little bit more thought and some advice from Glickman's neighbor who was a black man. His name was Kenneth Kelly, and he said, you know what, I see what he's saying about being patronizing. So if you're gonna do it, just do it in a very casual way. Don't make it some big revel lutionary stand. Just all of a sudden, have this black kid in there. And that's what he did.

00:21:04
Josh: Yeah, And doing that like that would have this twofold effect. One it would keep Charles Schultz from having to make like a big social statement, but two, it would also just show how utterly normal black kids and white kids commingling was that there wasn't even any commentary about it. It's just this new character who Charlie Brown met happened to be black. That was it, and that's how it happened. They met at the beach when Charlie Brown was on vacation with his family and.

00:21:32
iHeart Intro: Can I read the comic strip? Yeah, go ahead, all right, it's four panels. Charlie Brown's on the beach shirt off. He's got a shirt off. You gotta take your shirt off.

00:21:40
Josh: It was already off.

00:21:42
iHeart Intro: Okay. So Franklin comes up with a beach ball and says, is this your beach ball? Second panel, Charlie says, hey, yeah, thank you very much. Franklin says, I was swimming out there and it came floating. By third panel, my silly sister threw it in the water, and Franklin says, I see you're making a sand castle. And it's kind of a crooked tower. And in the last panel, Franklin says it looks kind of crooked, and Charlie said, I guess maybe it is where I come from. I'm not famous for doing things right, just quintessential Charlie Brown.

00:22:12
Josh: I acted all that up. By the way, you guys just couldn't see it.

00:22:15
iHeart Intro: It was great, but it was a very sweet way to meet. And then Charlie invited Franklin over to his side of town, and that's where Franklin got shook.

00:22:25
Josh: These are the strips that we learned Franklin's dad is off fighting in Vietnam. Yeah, and Charlie Brown. We learned Charlie Brown's dad as a barber. I don't know if that was the first time or not, but he mentions this in response to Franklin talking about his dad, which, if you'll remember, Charles Schultz's dad was a barber. So I think that's pretty sweet.

00:22:44
iHeart Intro: I love it. And you know what, at the end, we ad met at the beginning to read the very first ever strip. Let's save that for the end.

00:22:51
Josh: Okay, sadly, as we can attest, when you do the right thing and promote social unity and harmony, oftentimes ugly people will say ugly things about it. And Charles Schultz was no exception. He got, he said, he didn't get like a huge amount of hate mail, but it was very vehement and that included some of the editors of the papers that his column was syndicated in. He could have lost like a significant amount of money by had the had the wrong vibe been struck and like a push against him been you know, really kind of founded and carried out among especially Southern newspapers, like he was getting letters from editors saying things like, I don't appreciate seeing, you know, black kids and white kids being portrayed in the same school. What universe do you live in? Essentially, like where are you getting these kind of far out ideas? And he just basically he just shook it off. He was like, whatever, some people are gonna they're gonna hate it at first, but they're gonna get used to it because I'm not stopping. And he didn't. Yeah, and he was there's the He's looked two different ways for this one that Franklin was never fully fleshed out to the satisfaction of a lot of readers. And then there's another vein where Charles Schultz has looked at is really putting his reputation in his entire comic on the line by doing this because he thought it was the right thing and that it was groundbreaking and open the gates for other comic strip artists, particularly black ones, to follow in his footsteps.

00:24:28
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he threatened to quit at one point. There were some papers that said they were gonna either not run those strips or have them redone and he said, you're gonna print my comics as drawn, or I'm done or you lose me for everything, And this was to the actual syndication company, and so they backed down and allowed him to keep going. But one of the cartoonists that was certainly inspired by them that you mentioned was a guy named Rob Armstrong who did the comic strip Jumpstart, And we mentioned that Marcy didn't have a last name. Franklin was another character that didn't have a last name for a while and eventually got the last name Armstrong, named after Rob Armstrong the cartoonist, which was just a great tribute. Chultz came to him, they became friends, and he said, he asked him first, you know, if you don't mind, can I use your last name? And of course Armstrong, what do you say to that? You're just floored and was very very touched and honored that he became his last name.

00:25:31
Josh: Yeah, for sure.

00:25:32
iHeart Intro: It's a great story. And by the way, there's a great article about Harry Glickman and her neighbor Kenneth Kelly. There's a great article in Las just from a few years ago about this story and it shows them still friends today, hanging out and there's a great picture of them with a little Franklin holding a Franklin stuffy.

00:25:52
Josh: That's sweet. I think Harry Rickman passed in the last couple of years, but that's sweet that they were friends till the end.

00:25:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Yeah, this is in twenty twenty. Very cute.

00:26:01
Josh: So who else? Can we talk up a little bit about a couple more slightly minor characters I still think are worth mentioning.

00:26:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean we definitely need to mention pig Pen, who was a very beloved character even though he almost does nothing.

00:26:15
Josh: Yeah, he was another kid who had a great, perfect voice in the in the TV specials, it was kind of raspy and yeah, I can't describe it any other way but raspy. But it fit him perfectly.

00:26:28
iHeart Intro: Yeah. He can always dirty, always had that, the flies and the dust around him. And I think everyone, especially these days, kids are cleaner. But I remember in the seventies there were I remember the dirty kids. It just always seemed to be covered in film.

00:26:43
Josh: Yeah, and there was a strip. So he was introduced in a series of strips starting in nineteen fifty four, so pretty early on. And he says that he hasn't got a name. He says, people just call me things, real insulting things. Yeah, and I guess they never changed that, Like, his name is always pig Pen. But in one of the strips somebody's like, you know, they just presume that he hates baths and he goes, No, I really like baths. I just like getting dirty more, all right. So he's like a cool little kid who also I've seen him described as like maybe the most the one that's closest to like self fulfillment and satisfaction and contentment of any of the characters is pig Pen, which is pretty great.

00:27:23
iHeart Intro: He seems like he's never pining for something like the rest of them are.

00:27:27
Josh: He just goes and does it or gets it yeah or whatever.

00:27:30
iHeart Intro: And he was in Dave Did the Math. Zero point five of the comic strips featured pig Pen. Yeah, a little over one hundred out of almost eighteenth thousand.

00:27:40
Josh: There's also that Grateful Dead connection. One of the founding members of The Grateful Dead was Ron mcnernan, whose nickname was pig Pen. Apparently because he's a little smelly himself.

00:27:51
iHeart Intro: Is that way he got the name.

00:27:52
Josh: Yeah. And then Sally Man we got to talk about Charlie Brown's little sister, Sally.

00:27:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah, with their naturally early hair, she was always proud of that hair. Like I mentioned earlier, it might have been the previous episode. Lucy was always jealous because Sally Charlie got this sweet little sister and she wanted a little sister and not Linus. They all had little crushes, which is sweet. You know. We mentioned Lucy and Schroeder, but Sally had a big crush on Linus, which is very sweet.

00:28:19
Josh: Yeah. And one of the other things about Sally that was great was that she when she was upset, she would go talk to the school building.

00:28:28
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and it would talk back.

00:28:30
Josh: Yeah, it would. It would have thought bubbles, just like Snoopy does in response to her stuff. Like one time, I can't remember what she was talking. Oh, she said she was scolded by her teacher for talking in class, but the teacher was mistaken. She hadn't been talking at all, and she was really upset about this, and the school thinks, poor sweet baby.

00:28:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, just sweet and.

00:28:49
Josh: Stuff like that. Like Sally just kind of attracted that kind of thing.

00:28:52
iHeart Intro: Well, and the school thing kind of brings up the fact. And I know we talked a little bit about the minimalist style in the first episode, but so many of his panels were just them in front of a brick wall, or them at that psychiatrist stand or Snoopy's doghouse or just the picture's Matt right. It was all just very sort of spartan, sparse stuff.

00:29:13
Josh: Yeah, but it worked.

00:29:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:29:15
Josh: I saw it described as that that universes. It's it's bounded by those four panels and connected by the gutters the spaces between the four panels. But somehow it just seems like boundless. There's no there's no geography to it. You just are where you're where that that moment is taking place. But you couldn't possibly imagine the Peanuts universe in some mapped out way.

00:29:38
iHeart Intro: Yeah. I wonder if that's why it never occurred to me to wonder where they were from. Yeah, yeah, I mean have you ever thought about, like where was Peanuts based? I like, I never even wondered that.

00:29:50
Josh: I never thought that or wondered that. But I saw in a number of the essays that they presumed that it was in the Midwest because the seasons like there was there were there were definite seasons and Peanuts and I think as a kid that was one of the things that really got to me because I love the seasons too. So to see the Peanuts gang like hanging out in a pile of leaves, or ice skating or something like that, or it was summer and there was like an apple on a tree or something like. Yeah that, even like you said, even though it's minimalists and you can't even begin to imagine where they're from, it it would evoke like how those kids were feeling. Like it it added an extra layer to the dialogue or the action or something like that, because you, as a kid, knew how you felt when you were standing next to a pile of leaves and it was chilly out and Thanksgiving and Christmas were just you know, coming right down the pike.

00:30:43
iHeart Intro: So we know it's not Peanuts is anywhere USA except Florida, southern California, and Hawaii.

00:30:48
Josh: Yeah, and I think we said right, Charles Schultz is from the Minneapolis Saint Paul area.

00:30:54
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I'm sure it was just sort of that.

00:30:55
Josh: Yeah, So I mean that's that's generally where it was set. He eventually, I think, I think, not too long after getting married the first time, moved to Santa Rosa, California or northern California. Santa Rose is where the Charles Schultz museum is and never never looked back. But even still, he never the Peanuts gang never suddenly ended up in California like they were still where they were.

00:31:19
iHeart Intro: You know that's funny. All right, let's do our final break and finish up with part two of Part two of Peanuts. Right for this, we'll be.

00:31:28
Josh: Right back in two and two.

00:31:46
iHeart Intro: Softly jaw.

00:31:51
Josh: Soft so chuck. If I can remember all the way back to part one, the first episode in this pairing.

00:32:03
iHeart Intro: I think minutes ago.

00:32:05
Josh: I think I mentioned, how do you know that I.

00:32:08
iHeart Intro: Got a little ticker on my I got a timer.

00:32:10
Josh: I want one of those.

00:32:12
iHeart Intro: I got an egg timer?

00:32:15
Josh: Is it a snoopy egg timer?

00:32:17
iHeart Intro: It is?

00:32:17
Josh: Uh? So? I mentioned that there's no adults in the Peanut world and that if they're if an adult is is around, it's they're either being mentioned like a real life adult or an adult in the Peanuts universe like somebody's parent, or in the TV specials. You can hear them, but they're off camera. You don't see them, and the only way you hear them is that muted trombone sound effect.

00:32:40
iHeart Intro: Right.

00:32:41
Josh: Yeah, there is one strip in the Peanuts pantheon in the eighteen thousand comic strips. There's one where adults are shown, and even then it's just their legs.

00:32:54
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and even that, I think kind of like Franklin was shook. I think Peanuts people were shook.

00:33:01
Josh: For sure, for a number of reasons. One this whole series where Lucy is participating in an adult golf tournament for some weird reason, there's way more scenery, way more stuff going on in all the panels, right.

00:33:16
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's not a four panel. Was it from one of the books.

00:33:20
Josh: I don't know. It's from nineteen fifty four, so no, it would have been before the books.

00:33:25
iHeart Intro: All right, I know. Oh, it's a Sunday strip. So the Sunday's were more than four panels from May sixteenth, nineteen fifty four. And in that they're playing golf and stuff. She and Charlie Brown are Lucy was famously a bad athlete as well, because she was always screwing up in center field or in right field. But Charlie said she played center field for some reason. And in the last panel it shows them with three or four pair of adult legs standing around, and it's just it's almost surreal and disconcerting to see human legs and peanuts. Yeah, it's just odd to see it is.

00:34:02
Josh: They're wearing pants with crisism and everything. It's just it's not it ain't right, and I guess it ainate right. Charles Schultz realized immediately that it ain't right. I can't believe it even got out, you know, but he never did it again.

00:34:17
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he got death threats.

00:34:19
Josh: I'm sure.

00:34:20
iHeart Intro: How dare you show leg Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it was a very weird thing. I mean, I remember one thing I remember was because I was close to my one grandfather, my mom's dads before he died, and Charlie Brown and Franklin are always talking about their granddads, which I always thought was really great. Yeah, that is very sweet. We did mention the movie the TV specials. We went in depth into the Charlie Brown Christmas Special and do you remember what year it was, what Christmas episode that was?

00:34:48
Josh: It was either December fifth or ninth, nineteen sixty five when it first seme.

00:34:53
iHeart Intro: No no I met ours when we recorded our Christmas special where we talked in detail about the christ Special.

00:35:00
Josh: Yeah, December fifth or ninth, nineteen sixty five.

00:35:03
iHeart Intro: We had a podcast in nineteen sixty five.

00:35:05
Josh: Yeah, we have the way back Machine. They're all over the place. We have an episode from seven twenty CE.

00:35:13
iHeart Intro: Oh wow, yeah, Goody Clark and Goodie Bright.

00:35:15
Josh: Yeah that was a wild wild ride. Uh.

00:35:18
iHeart Intro: I don't remember which Christmas special we had it in, but in one of them we we detailed Charlie Brown Christmas and so we don't have to go over here. But the one sort of surprising thing if you didn't listen to that app was that they thought it was going to be a big failure.

00:35:30
Josh: Right, yeah, so there was no laugh track. But this is a cartoon featuring kids, ostensibly four kids, and there's no laugh track to the jokes? How are the dumb little kids going to know when to laugh? And then it has like like one of the best jazz soundtracks of all time. Yeah, but that's not exactly like what the what the eight year olds are into? Right in nineteen sixty five? Right, so yeah, the TV executives were like, this is going to go no, and boy were they wrong.

00:36:02
iHeart Intro: Oh man, I mean is there aren't many more iconic Christmas records than that one.

00:36:07
Josh: No, and not just Christmas records. The Great Pumpkin Waltz is in there, which is just, for my money, the best, the best one of the whole album, and that whole album is great, from the first note to the last.

00:36:19
iHeart Intro: I shouldn't restrict that to Christmas listening. No, I don't know if it can. That would be weird. But I mean I probably listened to that full record at least twenty times over the month of December. Yeah, maybe more, probably more than once a day. Yeah, if I'm thinking about.

00:36:34
Josh: It, I'm really almost religious about it because I don't I don't ever want to get sick of it, so I'm really careful, like how often I listen to it.

00:36:43
iHeart Intro: Oh, I just pound it. I'd never get to it.

00:36:46
Josh: It also has a song that has nothing to do with Christmas, Linus and Lucy, which is what most people who are generally aware of Peanuts and aren't like hardcore fans consider like the Peanuts theme.

00:37:02
iHeart Intro: Oh interesting. Yeah, and the uh, you know, the the cultural icon that is the Charlie Brown Christmas tree, and that's become part of the lexicon for a sad little Christmas tree.

00:37:13
Josh: Yeah, and you can buy a Charlie Brown Christmas tree too and put it on your tabletop, which we've done.

00:37:18
iHeart Intro: Oh, like a recreation or just a sad little tree.

00:37:21
Josh: It's well, you could do that and just call your sad little tree Charlie Brown Christmas tree. But you can buy one and it's.

00:37:27
iHeart Intro: Like like the actual Yeah.

00:37:28
Josh: It's got like a wooden X that it connects. It has like a little blue blanket. Linus is blanket that you put around the bottom like he does. It comes with a single red ornament. It's it's wonderful. You know what, buddy, I know what you're getting for Christmas.

00:37:43
iHeart Intro: Oh, I can put it next to the leg lamp.

00:37:46
Josh: That'd be perfect.

00:37:47
iHeart Intro: Actually, wow, that's great. Yeah, all right, I mean cheese. We could sit around talk about peanuts all day long if we're not careful, but we should wrap it up and talk a little bit about the end of peanuts. Sadly, Schultz said he was retiring. Announced it in December of nineteen ninety nine. He was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer. I don't even think we mentioned that he had a disease throughout most of his career, right, that was like had hand tremors.

00:38:16
Josh: Yes, So in nineteen eighty one, he was diagnosed with essential tremor, which is a tremor that affects you when you try to do something with your hands, most specifically, and he I could draw it, yeah, like drawing seven comic strips a week, all the every week, and you can actually see very clearly it's a progressive illness as well, progressive neurological disorder. So it just gets worse with time, and you can see through the progression of peanuts the line started getting much more squiggly. But if you look at tests of people with hand tremors, I think the most prevalent test is it's like draw like a circle from the inside out.

00:38:56
iHeart Intro: What the hell is that called spiral?

00:38:58
Josh: A spiral? Thank you? You started to center and go outward with the spiral, and they'll put that next to somebody who doesn't have an essential tremor and what that looks like, and it's just like night and day. So the fact that he can even continue on for twenty years is amazing.

00:39:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, jeez, unbelievable. So, yeah, ninety nine diagnosed with cancer. He had a big backlog of comic strips that he had drawn, so they were able to keep publishing through his illness until the day the day after he died. Actually, yeah, February twelfth, two thousand, he was seventy seven.

00:39:36
Josh: Isn't that remarkable, Like they both died at the same time, or they both expired at the same time, Peanuts and Charles Schultz.

00:39:42
iHeart Intro: Like they had that he had that many backlogs that it just worked out like that.

00:39:46
Josh: Yeah, and he had that many days left.

00:39:49
iHeart Intro: Yeah, pretty amazing unless a family was like there were one hundred more and they just shoved him in a drawer and said, it's really kind of a great story this way.

00:39:56
Josh: I'm hoping that's not the case me too.

00:39:59
iHeart Intro: His family was smart though, because they said, you know what, we don't think anyone else should ever draw this, like Peanuts should should stop because he's not around anymore. And that's what happened. That syndication company, unbelievably almost honored that request. When you see new Peanuts stuff now, whether it's like movies and you know, the brand is still a thing, but those those comic strips, if you see them, are all reprints.

00:40:26
Josh: Yeah, supposedly it's a billion dollar brand.

00:40:29
iHeart Intro: I believe it.

00:40:30
Josh: And I read a quote from Bill Waterson from Calvin and Hobbes, who basically was like, like merchandising cartoons and stuff you can thank Charles Schultz for that.

00:40:40
iHeart Intro: Amazing.

00:40:41
Josh: Yeah, And then we mentioned one more thing before we finished that. There was a tribute to Charles Schultz and Peanuts among basically all the working comic strip artists on November twenty six, twenty twenty two.

00:40:55
iHeart Intro: Very emotional.

00:40:56
Josh: Yeah, And you can go to the Charles Schultz Museum website. They have links to all of them, and just some of them are amazing, but a few stood out to me. We talked about the Gilthorpe one, which, now that you've heard these two episodes, go look up that Gilthorpe November twenty six, twenty twenty two, comic strip tribute to Peanuts because finally Charlie Brown gets to kick the football and it's just the sweetest, sweetest thing. I can't believe that they thought of doing that. It was just so perfect.

00:41:26
iHeart Intro: Great.

00:41:27
Josh: There was one from Curtis. You remember we talked about how a lot of black comic strip artists credited Charles Schultz with introducing Franklin is kind of breaking that ceiling for them. Sure, Curtis has one where Curtis, the comic strip character, asks Charlie Brown to hang out and or he goes, hey, Charlie Brown, what you do? And Charlie Brown goes just chilling, Homie, let's hang out. And as they're walking away, Curtis turns to you, the viewer and is like that Charlie Brown's a lot cooler than you'd think. When he's away from that Peanuts strip, Thatch Garfield has Snoopy bringing out like one hundred year birthday cake.

00:42:05
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that one's surreal looking.

00:42:07
Josh: And then to me, it is to me the one I give it like the most appropriately awkwardly formal award. Mary Worth was that Merriworth.

00:42:19
iHeart Intro: Okay, I thought it was so.

00:42:20
Josh: Maryworth is like the most bone dry soap opera and comic strip around to begin with, and just in total Merriworth's style. Merriworth is sitting on the couch and it just explains how this is Charles Schultz's hundredth birthday and they're all celebrating it. So, happy hundredth birthday, Charles Schultz. It's just so.

00:42:43
iHeart Intro: It was very Yeah, it was very dry. And then family Circle, I think Jeffy tripped over Snoopy's dead.

00:42:48
Josh: Body, which Charlie Brown was on the run from.

00:42:52
iHeart Intro: So I promised i'd read that very first comic strip, because it's really emblematic of like what Charles Schultz was going after, Like his debut comic strip for his baby was this, And it's very a little more crudely drawn obviously. But panel one, these two kids are sitting on the sidewalk and you see Charlie Brown in the distance walking up, and the kid on the sidewalk goes, well, here comes old Charlie Brown. And then Charlie Brown is kind of walking in front of him. Good old Charlie Brown, Yes, sir. And then he walks by and they're watching him pass, and he goes good old Charlie Brown. And then the kid on the sidewalk in the last panel says, how I hate him. That's the debut through the world.

00:43:33
Josh: That's really amazing, pretty amazing, everybody. That was a great way to end it, Chuck.

00:43:39
iHeart Intro: Hey, thanks.

00:43:40
Josh: If you want to know more about Peanuts, just go start reading Peanuts comic strips. Even if you didn't appreciate him, you'll probably learn to like him more just by forcing yourself to. And since I said that, it's time for listener, ma'am.

00:43:57
