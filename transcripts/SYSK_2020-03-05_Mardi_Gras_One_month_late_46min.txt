Josh: Hello, people in Vancouver and Portland. We're coming to see you, uh in March. Okay, did I step on you? No? No, I stepped on you, I think. Man. All right, well this is as clunky as we usually are. Uh, we are going to be coming to those two fair cities that I learned don't have direct flights yesterday and I can't wait regardless. So we're gonna be in Vancouver on Sunday, March twenty nine at the Chance Center. That's right. We're kicking it up a notch there, so we need your support, yeah, for real. And then the next day we're really kicking it up a notch maybe two. In Portland. We're gonna be at the Schnitzer Concert Hall on Monday March that's right, and we need your support there to Portland because uh again, these are bigger venues. We're giving it a whorld. Don't don't put egg on our faces for God's sake. Yeah. Yeah, So you can get all sorts of information, you can buy tickets, everything you need to go to s Y s K live dot com and we'll see you in March. Welcome to stuff. You should know a product enough. I heart radios. How stuff works, Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w Chuck Bryan over there, there's Jerry over there. And this is Stuff you Should Know, the super Topical Timely Edition because Chuck, this episode is about Marty Graw and we're recording it on Marty Graw, right, which in true stuff you should know fashion it will come out a month after. So what we need to do is do this a month before so it comes out on that Tuesday. Well that would that be like the Daily or something, not stuff you should know, you know what I mean? Yeah, And I've been going around the office showing everyone in my boobs all day. I was wondering you had all those beads. No, I understand. Yeah. I think we should apologize in advance to to the people of New Orleans, because when it comes to something this specific, we always just get killed. Right, it's so personal to so many people. We're gonna mess up so much. They're gonna be like, you didn't mention my crew, right, Um? Yeah, I mean I've been to New Orleans twice for the shows that we've done there. It was not around Marty Graw read a bunch about it. So now I understand New Orleans Marty Graw better than ever. But I also learned that it's one of those things where it's kind of like like researching humor, where you can understand the mechanism behind humor and you can explain humor, but it doesn't quite capture it fully. That's what we're gonna do here. This one will stink right now, it won't. It'll be fine. I've never been to Marty grow either, and I mean I just have no interest at all, mainly because of seeing a lot of cops Marty Gral New Orleans episodes. Oh yeah, yeah, it's just it's a young It's not for me, you know. But I love New Orleans. And you can find your the most hospitable people on the planet there at any time of year, and they won't get mad at us. That's what's so great about them. We're gonna mess up a lot and they'll be like, yeah, it's all right, Yeah, don't worry about a guy. They'll kill us, but they won't get mad at us, you know what I mean. Maybe also I want to shout out our friend Doug Shashary sassy. I even I practiced it, Chuck it's a tough name. Who is at our New Orleans show and brought us up what were they called Budden Balls. Yeah, it was so good. But Doug's a great guy with them without the gift of bud. Yeah, boy, that guy is like a friend to the world. He invited us again. So Shash Sassary if that name sounds familiar, the Tony Sassary seasoning. He is the is an heir to the throat. He's one of the Sasshary kids. Uh grandkids maybe, and um. He has invited us to their company Boil again this April. He has for like the last few years. We're going to get to that one of these these days we will. Uh. Just a great, larger than life guy, like doesn't know a stranger, right. We met him once and I felt like he was the best friend. Yeah, he was hanging out with his backstage. He's like great. Hey, this kind of reminds me of the time I was hanging out backstage with Metallica every time at the time I met the Three Stages. Yeah, they were great. Yeah, it's just like that's awesome man. Yeah, what a good dude. Anyway, Hey, Doug, Uh, Well, so let's get it started, Charles, Yes, Uh, Marty Gras a k A. And is it pronounced carnival or does that have to have an e on the end? I think it's Carnival. And I think it's Carnival because it actually comes from the Latin words carna or carn a vale, which means farewell to the flesh, meat, volleyball. That's that's a better interpretation. It's wrong, but I like that farewell to the flesh. Is that what it means. Yes, not to be confused with candy man to farewell to the flesh. It just means farewell to the flesh. Uh. Carny Ball and Marty Gras begin in January, and like we said, today's Fat Tuesday. So everything has been going on in New Orleans and other places. But we're talking about the New Orleans Mardy Gras, not Mobile Alabama. I'm sorry. I know that you were the o g s but apparently right. Yeah, they I was gonna say that they had the first one by a mile from from this, like I think, fifteen years before New Orleans was even founded. This, yeah, and our very own. I mean, there are various neighborhoods around the world that do stuff like this. Kirkwood in Atlanta, for some reason has a little New Orleans thing and every year they do a little Marty Gras parade and paint the signs purple and gold and green. And I don't know why. Maybe there's just some people from New Orleans who showed up. Guess yeah, that that happened to post Katrina. We got a lot of people that moved here. But yeah, there was a lot. Yeah, that's right. I wonder if that does have to do with that, and maybe, but there it does. It does seem like the history of Marty Gras and the different influences from Marty Graw kind of have converged in New Orleans. It's like, yes, give us this, We'll take this tradition. Yes, give us that. And now everybody thinks when you think Marty Gras, you think New Orleans. But one thing that I don't think this article um really pointed out very well is Marty Grass is a day that's one part of carnival. Yeah, it's the culmination of a couple of weeks of partying and parading and masquerade bawling. Yes, uh, and well we'll just see a lot of fun stuff, right, But It's so like if you go down to Rio for Carnival, it's the exact same festival, celebrated differently in Brazil, but the same thing they're celebrating the same thing as they're celebrating throughout the Marty Gross season in New Orleans or in kirk Way. I bet Brazil would be pretty fun. I can't imagine with all the all those ugly men and women that live there right just in drab like baggy clothing. Man, that's my favorite part of the World Cup is just seeing people in the crowd from Brazil, all the models. The average person is a supermodel, so that's what it says on the tourist webs that's right. Uh. And Fat Tuesday, of course, is the day before ash Wednesday, which is tomorrow and the beginning of Lent. I grew up Baptist, as everyone knows, and so I'd never had to You never got the charcoal on your forehead. No, And in fact, in the in the South in the seventies and eighties, there were so few Catholics that they throw stones at you if you had the charcol Well, I didn't even know what it was, really, I mean, I was I think I remember being in college and being like, you've got something on your head. I don't remember what the ashes for. I'm sure one point three billion Catholics will write in to tell us, but it's it's the start of Land, like you said, which is a period of fasting before Easter. Right, it's a very it's a very holy period for the Roman Catholic Church. Yeah, And I think the original idea was for the partying is hey, let's let's indulge before we have to not indulge right on, like foods and stuff. I don't think it was like let's all get super hammered. Well, I don't know, I don't know. Maybe so um fire to that. Even it has roots and paganism even before the Roman Catholic like every holiday we celebrate is based on paganism and then syncretized by the Roman Catholic Church. But um, the pagan roots of it were more um pragmatic or practical, where you had stuff that was like the last of the harvest um from the summer before the fall before and it was starting to get kind of starting to turn and spoil, and you needed to eat it before that time. So it was this this period of like using up everything in the house that was about to turn bad eggs, and like you would do that. It was called um uh graw boof I believe, or boof graw no grab boof, which means fat fat cow or fat fat beef. And it was it was this idea that that, like the right, that the beef had been fattened just to perfection and they weren't gonna get any fatter, and maybe they wouldn't even make it any any further, and you just slaughter them and eat them, or you just eat all this stuff in your house. Maybe it wouldn't make any further. Like that call is about to die. It's like it's so fat, let's eat it. Uh. So they think are that there's evidence at least that there was Marty Grass celebrating going on, maybe as early as the eighteenth century, definitely from what I saw. There was a French explorer named Pierre Lemoie Sieur de Belleville. I think you you really got it, Yeah, especially if you crunch it together and speed it up. I can't. I think he really nailed it. And he was exploring around and camping out about fifty miles south of what is now New Orleans and he's like, Hey, I know that they're celebrating in France right now, so I am going to christen the site. Point do Marty Gras? Uh? And like we said, though, the real Marty Grass celebration kind of started in Earnest and Mobile, Alabama though. Right, Yeah, so he named the I don't know if he actually celebrated Marty Gras, but he named that little area, right, he named that area Ponto Marty Gras. But the so that was six apparently four years later. Um in Mobile, before it was even a town, they celebrated. They had their first like Mardi Gras party or whatever, a ball or something like that at the Fort. And then New Orleans was it was UM Incorporator founded in seventeen eighteen, and they started having UM Mardi Gras parties like shortly after that. So he's all very close to the beginning of the eighteenth century, everybody started having Marty Grass and it was like directly from the French influence in the area. And if you look into the early eight hundreds, like the eighteen twenties and into the eighteen thirties, this is when you start seeing a lit little bit more of what we're talking about as far as uh, carriages that are decorated, people parading in masks, walking on foot probably at this point or in carriages. It was largely spontaneous though. There'll just be people partying on the street wearing masks, um that way. Yeah, and they did, and then other people will walked that way too, and all of a sudden you had a parade. But the thing is is these this revelry on the streets because everybody was indulging. And the point was like that just indulge, but we're like, really over indulge. Like this wasn't just your average like village party. This is everybody was getting trashed even back then, and so people were getting in fights, and people were beating up each other, and horses were kicking people right off their feet. All sorts of crazy stuff was happening. It was yeah, cops, New Orleans, um. And so the city, the city leaders were like, we're not going to do this anymore. This is out of hand. And an eighteen fifties seven, I believe a group of actually from what I saw, transplants from Mobile who were members of a group called the Cowbellian de Rakian Society Okay, they um, they said, hey, how about this, We'll actually organize a legit parade and it will be much more orderly, there won't be this chaos. And they formed the Mystic Crew of Commas. Yeah, so there's a lot of k's in place of c's mystic as a K. But it doesn't look scary like we talked about, right and and oh does it to you? Well, not mystic crew, but it depends on what follows mystic because it could look creepy to me. But crew was spelled with a K R E W E. And we should go ahead and talk a little bit about what a crew is. It's uh, it's a group of people who get together and um, technically they are like legit nonprofits and they get larger at least charity organizations that they're supposed to be. Yeah, and they are sort of the group of people who would get together and say, all right, this is our gang, and we're gonna gang in a good way, and we're gonna make a float and do this theme this year and all get together and get super drunk. Probably not all of them, I bet you. There's a a non drinking crew like one gotta be there. Has to be at right, But they they they they were anonymous originally, like they were secret groups that were like out and proud in public, but like they wore masks and like their identity really was anonymous, Like you were an anonymous member of this group. That's right, and um. Over time now people like the anonymity is not quite as important, and it's to some though. I think I think sometimes they take it seriously. Yeah, I mean not in that like, I don't know, maybe you can't get kicked out. It might, it might be more of a lighthearted thing, but I think generally they try and still respect the the masks on approach. Sure, okay, all right, but I mean, like if you told somebody like I'm a member of the Crew of Rex or something like that, not going to kick you out, it's taking your mask off during the parade specifically, I think. So, yeah, so they here about it. We got that right, we definitely want But they grew from these little tiny societies into very large groups, well funded almost across the board because they're supported by dues, and they put on parades and balls, masquerade balls on the night of Mardy craw and um. Some of them are just really enormous, have like big name celebrities and like huge bands that play, and they'll still nominate a person to be like the leader or the king or queen each year. Like you could they could say, Josh Clark, we want you to come down. They could and be the King of our crew this year. And that's how it started back in not eighteen fifty seven. I think it's eighteen seventy two that the first king of a crew was nominated, right, But eighteen fifty seven was when the Mystic Crew of Comus had what's now looked at the first as the first kind of modern Marty Gras parade, and uh aside from a few years where like World Wars interrupted things, they've kind of been doing this every year since then. Yeah, there's another. So eighteen fifty seven was a big year. Eighteen seventy two that I mentioned was another big year because that year the the traditional Marty Gras colors were added, I believe by the Crew of Rex. And there's a lot of um, a lot of misunderstanding supposedly, so that year the Crew of Rex named as their king or the leader, I can't remember which one he was. The Russian Grand Duke Alexei, who was from the House of Romanoff, And they said, well, these colors came from the House of Romanoff, the gold, the green, and the purple that we all associate with with Marty Gras. That's just absolutely not true. The House of Romanoff has like red, yellow, and blue, I believe are their colors. But that's just the legend that came about. But some other stuff happened that year, like the idea of electing a king to your Mardi Gras parade, um, throwing beads for the first time happened that year. The song, Yeah, the song what what is it? If I ever ceased to love? That's not how I was gonna say. I've never heard it actually, so you I bet you if we played it, you might recognize it. So the colors, though purple stands for justice, screen for faith, and gold for power, supposedly all just made up out a whole cloth. Yeah, And the idea with the beads was supposedly originally that you would toss these two people who you thought exemplified these traits. I'm not sure how accurate that is either. Um. Now it is, of course morphed into another tradition, which I don't even know if that's still going on. What hey, Mr, throw me something? Yeah, throw me something, Mr, Mr throwing some some combination of those words. Well, I'll show you something and you throw me something. Oh, that's different. So I think it went from you look like you're involved in justice. Here's some b to there's this traditional call. I think, um, Mr, throw me something, okay, and then I think it morphed into the boops thing that you just said. That literally quieter. But I don't even know. You know, with all the advancements we've made in the past few years, if people are doing that anymore, I would like to know about that, because I'm not gonna go down to Marty Grawl. I'll come to New Orleans, not jazz Fest and not Marty Graw, and I'll have a blast, but I'm not going to go to those things there. We were there last October, I think, so yeah, and there's candy in the streets, and I'm like, there's no way this is left over from Marty Graw. Dude, there's parades all the time. That's what I was wondering. Yes, did they just do it all the time? I mean every time I've been, there have been parties and parades. It just it just seems like one of those towns where they're always getting down throwing candy. Uh should we well, I guess we should just say quickly if you're before we break, if you're gonna go, we're not discouraging you go, but plan in advance, because it's not the kind of thing where on a the week before you can be like, hey, dude, let's go. Man, I think you can go under those for sure you'll be sleeping in the van kind of experience. Then if you like book a hotel, you're in advance. Yeah, you won't get a hotel, you won't be able to eat an Emeralds or anything like that unless you plan like far far in advance. You could storm Emeralds, which people who sleeping vans and talk like you just did mind to you? All right, So let's take a break and we'll talk more about Marty Gras. All right. So if you are the city of New Orleans, you love Marty Gras because it brings in a ton of money every year. Yeah, I think I'm like a half a billion dollars. I couldn't believe that, man, half a billion dollars so much a year, not since it started a couple hundred years ago, but every year about half a billion dollars in revenue. Yeah, and this is something I thought was super cool. They're not. There's no corporate sponsorship there. There can be. Oh really, but it's not like I don't want to interrupt you go ahead. Well it's it's not like there's one Mardi Gras committee and that is sponsored by X car brand and there's a president of Mardy Graw. Like it's all patchworks of cruise and neighborhoods and people. Yeah, and all of them operate autonomously. Yes. Basically, what the city does is say, we can have X number of parades this year. These are the routes. Get a permit if you want to do it. Everything else is up to you. But like a local crew could be sponsored by Chico's bail bondsman. Basically, yeah, okay man, that was a great deep cause right there. But um, it's customary not to. If you do that, you're you know, again, you're operating autonomously, so nobody can tell you not to. But it's just kind of looked down upon. But some do. I saw somebody sponsored by bud Lte and I could not find it. Um, so it gets that big. Yeah, dude, the I mean just the the crew of Endemon e N d y m O N. Who knows how to pronounce half of these? I'm sorry, I'm sure we're butchering it. I need to have my word butcher april on but um the crew of Endemon, I'm pretty sure I got it. There's usually ends their parade usually ends in the Superdome with bud Man basically duf man Um in the Superdome and they'll have like a huge concert like this year. I think the Superdome is under construction, so they're ending it somewhere else. But like Sticks is playing, Train is playing. There's like five bands Sticks. Dude. Sure I would walk however long to go see Sticks Sticks without Dennis too young, But that's really as he did. No, he just doesn't. They broke up and Sticks went on without their lead singer. I don't know, man, I think the crew of Endemont's got enough like cash to bring him back. You to be cool as if Endemon had Sticks and like, uh the Mystic crew had Dennis de Young on the other side of town. You got to choose, you know, your allegiance. Yeah, I don't want to hear Mr Roboto or too much time on my hands. I think Tommy Shall sing that. Okay, so when did that start? Tommy? Well, now he's always been around, but he was there was the lead singer. Then Tommy Shall played guitar and sang a few of their songs, okay, and then he took over when Dennis the Young left. Sure, okay, what do you do when the Dennis to Young vacuum opens up? I don't know, I mean step in there could also fill it with Sammy Hagar. Oh man, I was listening to some Van Hagar this weekend because that's what Emily loves. It was great, big shout up to Aaron Hagar. Yeah, this is a shout out at huh. I guess so um. I don't remember how we got on that, but oh yeah, so so yes, some of these should be so big. The super Cruise specifically, we'll talk a little more about that, but the super Cruise are like these big giant ones that are just tradition that have hundreds of members on, you know, in their parade. One of them, I think end DeMont Um has one float that's like three sixty ft long. There's like thirty two hundred floaters in their parade, just a ton of people they throw out, like I think, yeah, fifteen million throws things that they throw out, everything from beasas to balloons and all that. Fifteen million in a parade. So yeah, these things can get like bud Light corporate sponsorship level amazing. So uh, it is an integrated parade now in series of parades now obviously pre integration, Uh, there were communities, African American communities in New Orleans that got together their own jam, which I bet was quite a party. Um. The crew, the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club Incorporated is one said cruise. Although I did see that there are some white people in that crew. Now, oh didn't integrate. That's cool, I think so because there was some controversy. They dress up in I think traditional African garb and they well they were grass skirts. Well they were black face, to which I saw a couple of years ago there was a call to stop the black face even though the African American and they said, but there were some white members doing it too, And they said, you know, because of the minstrel roots and which I totally want to do one on minstrel shows. Uh to not do it anymore? Other people say no, it's it's more rooted in like the mask tradition for us. So I'm not sure if they're still doing that or not. As of I was reading on their website about their history that this is not the first time they were kind of protested by UM African Americ Ricans. In the sixties, there was a big like push against him in their membership dwindled down to I think sixteen people because it was just so unpopular what they were doing. I think Louis Armstrong were black face one year as they're really king, but they so the Social Aid and Pleasure Club. The Social Aid part is that that group started out back in the day where UM, and it wasn't just African Americans, but I could definitely see during the Jim Crow era where African Americans needed to do this. They would all chip in like membership dues, and then when they fell ill that you know, that larger pot of money would take care of them, basically like insurance is supposed to work, right. But that's where the Social AIG came from. But they still are a charity organization. Interesting, and Dougie Fresh is playing at their ball today. Oh really, if you had a chance to see sticks or Dougie Fresh, which would or too young doug you Fresh? It would be pretty cool. I know of Dougie Fresh, but I'm not. I'm not hip to those j ms. You don't have to be hip to to know Dougie Fresh. Well, I mean it's been around. I mean I don't know them. I guess what I mean. I know I'm not hip already. A second ago, I think you said balloons instead of doubloons. No, I didn't, I think. So let's read why balloons? Uh, we need to pass forward. So doubloons are we've reached a new low here and here twelve Uh. They are aluminum. They are a little coin like objects and they have um the Cruise in Sydney on one side and then whatever their theme is on the other. They toss these out of people. There's a lot of tossing. Yeah, and actually those things to balloons, um fall under the larger umbrella of throws of balloons. Did I said to balloons this? Okay? Man, you got my head chuck. Yeah, those are throws throws or anything that is thrown from afloat and usually it's a very inexpensive souvenir deeds, very very customary. Those DA balloons are a little more UM saw it after a challenge, like I think, if it's like um, if it has like the groups insignia and then on the other side of the theme that year, it's definitely considered a collectible and not just generic ones. I guess I think so. And then um, like others, other people's throws are like other cruise throws are like really sought after, Like the zulus throws are coconuts um and like real coconuts. I think they were at one point. I'm not sure if they had everybody, but I read this Chowhound article about throws and they were saying, like, the Zulus don't throw coconuts anymore because of legal reasons. Well, it's funny. There's a lot of stuff in here. Um, you might as well talk about the kincakes and the chokable that they would put inside of the kincake. Uh. If you've never had a kincake, it is a big uh sugared cake. It's oval with a hole in the middle. It's like a Danish yeah, but it's a Danish just like slathered in sugar of of purple green and gold and very rich and sugary. And the tradition, of course to put the little plastic baby Jesus or represented baby Jesus. Initially, I guess it's a naked baby, sure, swaddling clothes. Uh. That started what was the guy's name, It's a Donald Intrager who started that in the forties. Yeah, the nineteen forties. So it's not like a hundreds year old tradition. Yeah, and it actually didn't survive terribly long because at some point in time in the not too distant past, Baker's started to say, we don't want to get sued either. Those zulus are onto something. We're We're going to stop baking the little plastic baby dolls into this cake. Yeah, that just seems insane because people could choke on them. So now it comes in like a little pack, like a little cellophane package that says stick in at your own risks, and then you just I guess you stick it in and then lick your hand and smooth icing back over to to cover up that part. So I'm trying to figure out the first time we went to New Orleans. I think it was around Marty Gras, unless they have another big kincake celebration, which they might. They don't is that they do. Not. Kingcake season actually runs from um King's Day, which is January six, which is the day that officially kicks off Marty Grass season in New Orleans, until ash Wednesday. You're not supposed to be able to get a kincake outside of that. So you know, it may not have been for a tour, because I did take another trip down there with our friends Gus and Matt and their son. I can't remember if that was the same trip or not, so I'm getting a mom mixed up. But whenever we were down there, our friends Makes and Jackie who lived there, uh took us on like a neighborhood kincake. That traveling party. I think that was for our show, because those people I think you're talking about came backstage that first show, Maxing Jackie definitely did okay. And then I specifically remember walking under a scaffolding bleacher painted green, maybe even purple, and it was along a street around It must have been either before or after something, but it was during the season, so I guess Ultimately, what I'm saying is the first time must have been around then. Yeah, And it's also both of our recollections together it forms a cohesive. And I'm not the first person to uh have various New Orleans trips kind of blurred together, blur together in my head. But all I know is that kincake thing was I felt like strangers, literal strangers were just like, come on in and giving you kincake, yes, and every other kind of great food and sweet. Yeah, they do have a pretty good food down there. Man. So um man, we're just knocking the traditions out, aren't we. Else? What else should we talk about? The parades? Yeah, I mean there's a lot of parades. Uh, you know, fifty sixty, seventy eighty parades. I think this year accounted seventy nine nine. Like that's the level of commitment you're getting out of Josh Clark is hand counting the number of parades from the parade schedule. Uh, the twelve days leading up to Marty Grass, those final twelve days are when now that's Carnival. I don't know why this article was so averse to saying it. Yeah, that is weird because they kept saying anything but just calling it carnival. Well, no, no, no, but it leads up to the day of Marty Gras, right, yeah, Marty Graz one day of Carnival, Yeah, which is what carnival is, the twelve days leading up to Marty CROs, including Marty CROs. That's right. But those are concentrated in the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, um St. Bernard and Sant Tammany. M Is that how it's pronounced. Probably, But there are pre season parades like it has eked out longer and longer over the years, is the impression I get. Yeah, and just the same that King Cakes become available January six, that same day King's Day, there's a couple of parades that typically um, a couple of parades or at least events that typically um kick off this whole season, even though Carnival doesn't start until the second Friday before Fat Tuesday. Just chew on it. It's all there. Um. The actual Mardy Grass season kicks off on January six, that's right. Chew on that naked baby made of plastic. Right, And because we should also, we haven't said this one more thing about dates and calendars. It's a lot of fun. Um because the the Lenten season can change because Easter is not on one fixed day. Has to do with the moon or like rabbit reproduction or something like that. That Um, Marty Gras can actually fall anywhere between February three and March nine. That's a big long stretch that it could fall on, right, But it has to do with when Easter comes, because Marty Grass forty days plus six before Easter, that's right, those six Sundays. Right, we should have a sideshow called Calendar Talking. We should. It would be great. We just launched a spinoff just like too Close for Comfort. That's right, Too close for comfort? Right. We heard back from a few people on that. So it's not a spinoff of anything, right, No, I don't think so. Uh So, these crews have themes every year, and they they can range. Sometimes it's about a legend or a famous story. Sometimes it's a kid's story, sometimes something from literature, mythology. I think about half of these crews have names that are Greek or Roman in origin. Right, Yeah, that's well. I think it's kind of a nod to the pagan roots. Um, and it also includes Egyptian stuff too, and I saw that the whole idea of wearing masks and like masquerade balls and all that actually traces its roots back to ancient Egypt. So it's really interesting like this this stuff kind of traveled from ancient Egypt to ancient I guess Greece and then Rome and the medieval Europe and then over to the New World and then interesting that it's not like it's just been one unbroken chain, but it's it's connected enough that the current cruise name themselves after like Osiris or Isis or you know who isis the deity? Um, they're not down with the terrorists organization, right right? Um, that that that there's at least that awareness that this is rude to This whole tradition is rooted in in in in history that far back. I think it's really cool and all brought to you by bud Light and show me your boobs. Uh should we take a break? Uh sure, all right, let's take a break and we'll talk a little bit more about super cruise right after this. What's a super crew, Josh, Well, a super crew the best crew there there. Well, so typically there's a couple of qualifiers. One, they're usually um, very well funded, large membership. Um, and they'll have their parades will occur within the last few days before and including Marty Grawl. Yeah. And these are the ones, like you were saying, that have some of them three hundred foot long floats or you know, like a hundred floats in their crew. These are the ones that get the celebrities in that convertible at the front. Yeah. And just like having corporate sponsorship, it was customer. You did not have outsiders as like the king of your parade. I would think so. Um. And then it was the crew of Bacchus that was the first to kind of break from that tradition. Back in nine nine Danny Kay, the famous whig designer. What does that mean? I don't even know. Okay, I thought there was some like serious in joke that I was no, no, no, okay, just random Yeah, I gotcha, but no. He was a famous musical actor, right yeah, and wig design Uh. And the the parade format is basically where the captain I think we were calling them leaders. Yeah, they can't be called leaders to a crew leader. Uh. They are at the head of procession. They're usually on a float that is, or they could be on horseback or in that convertible like we're talking about, and then it is followed in succession by officers, kings, queens. Sometimes you got maids and dukes and everyone's just having a good old time, right, And so you said something to about the themes, right, So each parade and press processions theme. There's like you said, there's no overall theme to Mardi Gras, but there's a theme for each and every parade, and the crew selects it every year, and like their floats are going to reflect that. But what's funny is they're very frequently like children's literature, mythology, um like like historical stuff for stuff that everybody knows, like almost bland. And the reason that I kind of drew from the subtext of this article is there's a finite number of floats that you can rent in New Orleans for your parade, and a lot of them have things like little bo Peep on them, because some of these are rented and a lot of them are typically it's just the super crew that has the money and the man power um to to build a float from scratch every year, and so the super Creuse will have like way varying themes but like a smaller crew will have a theme where you know, they can cobble together some floats, some rented floats to make a cohesive um um theme. Yeah, like what do you got left too close for comfort? Right, the Jim J. Bullock float. But for that year the Zulus did the Seinfeld theme. That was right, But the but I think that the floats available have to do with the theme because um interesting, you know, there are just a there's a finite pool and there's a lot of them though, so much so that I think St. Charles Parish, believe or St. Orleans Parish, one of the two, has an ordinance that the same float can't go through the business district in more than two parades during one Mardi Grass season. Right, so let's say you have a pre parade with Little bo Peep. Uh, you can't go back out as Little bo Peep. You can you can one more time? Oh you can only do it? Can't two more? So they give you two? Yeah, the same float can't be used more than twice in more than season through the central business district. But there's four different parishes putting on Marty Gras Parade, So technically that same float could see a pretty decent amount. So that's just in each parish, just in either or Leans or St. Charles Paris, I can't remember, so a little bo peep could be seeing lots of action potentially conceivably sure, Yeah, alright, but I think that's pretty interesting. It really kind of reveals like how seriously they take their Marty Gras parades in New Orleans, their local laws saying how many times a float can be used because they want to keep it fresh and interesting. That's right. Yeah. So the other thing too, when they're selecting these leaders or the royalty, it says sometimes it's just random draws for the king and queen. I would think it would a lot of more thought would go into it than that, but I don't know. Maybe some of them do pick randomly, not if it's coming from your membership, and you know, I think, I, oh, well, that makes it fair, I guess, right, because and you can't jockey for position, But um, you can also invite celebrities other times. Um, you actually will pay for the privilege to to be the king or the queen or duke or a maid in the court. Um. I didn't see how much you would pay, but yeah, it was very curious about that. That's pretty rich. Yeah, you know, like like we pick you, congratulations, give us some where's my where's my two dollars? So the costumes and the masks are obviously a big, big part of this um that's where a lot of money is generated custom rental and making original costumes. Um. It is tradition, like we said to to leave on your mask, but they're way more flexible about it now than they used to be, I think. But yes, but Bacchus and Rex I believe, are like you can lose your membership if you take your mask off during their Marty Gras parade. I'll have you killed you well right there in the street, which is ruined more than one Marty Gras. Yeah, but apparently it's so um like the mask part of it is so um ingreened. It's such an ancient part of this that goes way back in time that it's still just totally widespread today, not just among people in the prey, but among people watching the parade too. And this article says, you might feel weird actually not having a mask on, but street vendors have you covered. You can just buy one from one of them. Of course you can. There's plastic garbage everywhere to buy and throw. Right. You used to sell it, didn't you. Oh? I sold the glow noodles. I love those, man. Uh can we talk about moon pies? Sure? Sure, So this makes a lot of sense as a throw to take the place of something that could really hurt somebody, because a traditional throw in New Orleans a sweet treet used to be cracker Jack's boxes, which are very you know, it's like any tiny box. If you throw that from ten or twelve feet away down onto someone, one of those corners can hit you in the face and that's no fun. So the tradition of throwing the moon pie, which if you don't know what a moonpie is, you're missing out. It is a Southern It's gonna call it delicacy, but that might get him at gas station, so it really isn't. But they are two Graham cracker cookies, soft ones between with marshmallow filling in between, dipped in chocolate. It's kind of like a portable s'more that's room temperature cold and soft. Yeah. Like it's not a hard gram right right, it's like soft and crumbly. Yeah, And they're you know, I haven't had one in years and years, but I'm from the South, so I've had a moonpie or two in my day. Yeah. You. We went on this little kick a few back, yeah, where she was like what is this and tribe when she's like, let's there's a gas station, let's stop and get a moonpie. And it lasted for about a week and a half and she's like, so you got gas twice shade to basically I think. I mean, they have other flavors now too, but the chocolate is the the original. Uh. And they started in nineteen seventeen when a salesman traveling salesman from Chattanooga, uh, the Chattanooga Bakery ran into as the story goes, a coal miner from Kentucky who said, you know what we could use down there in the coal mines is a a portable snack right afordable? And they came up with the moonpie, I guess. And that coal miner was Lauretta Loon's father, wouldn't that who That movie was about coal miner's daughter. Yea great movie. Uh. And this became a big Southern thing, but it didn't become a Marty Graw thing until Mobile, Alabama and they're cracker Jack's cracker Jack Ordinance two, I said, I think so where they said the city actually outlawed cracker Jack's being thrown from Marty Graw floats because people were getting injured by him or hurt. So people said, well, moonpies totally makes sense. You get hit in the eye with the moonpie, not a big deal. And now if you go to Marty grow in New Orleans, apparently you can get moonpies thrown at you all over the place. Great, and you don't even have to don't even have to duck, nope, or take your shirt off. You got anything else? No? I don't either. Happy Marty Grob everybody, Happy ash Wednesday? I guess depending on when you hear this, Happy Easter? Sure? Okay? Uh And since I said happy Easter, of course that means it's time for listening mail. I'm gonna call this the long awaited fire safety email. Thank you. I can finally clear this out of my inn box. I know you've been asking me off and on since last August. Hasn't really been that long? Yeah, oh man, but not like every week. It's not like I'm not a sadist. Uh. Here we go, I'm a research engineer that studies fired dynamics and material flammability. My group has developed campaign to educate the public about general fire dynamics, fire safety, and what to do in case of a dwelling fire. The cornerstone of this is this as good as he thought it was hoped it would be. The cornerstone of this campaign is called close before you doze, and that is c l O s E. Not clothing. Oh, I'm glad you said that. Yeah. Uh, it's focused on residents closing their bedroom doors were going to sleep because the strategy has been extensively tested in large scale and experiments and provide I'm sorry, proven to slow down the advance of the fire to provide adequate time for firefighters to conduct search and rescue. That makes sense to close your doors when you go to bed, Yeah, because if a fire does break out in your house, it will keep the smoke out a lot longer than it would if your doors open, giving firefighters a time to come get you. Did you previously sleep with your doors open? Have you always been a door closed guy? Uh? Guiltily must admit that I still sleep with the door open. I'm toast. Is there a reason or just like or you do you not even care? I don't like is it a conscious thing? I know, it's more it just feels weird to me to have the door closed sleeping. But yeah, all right, I listened to Stuff you Should Know during my morning and evening commutes to really enjoy all the research topics and the fine and I find that the way Josh and Chuck that's us present the information has always been very easy for me to relate to and understand. I think that it is a great medium to help educate the population about the potentially life saving difference a closed door can make the event of a fire. It's truly stuff everyone should know. And hope you think so as well, and help us to get this information to the public. A year later almost let me see here that is from Mark. Nice work Mark who again as a research engineer doing work in fire dynamics and safety. Nice work Mark, Thanks Chuck for doing that one. Um, I hope you guys listen to Mark. Don't follow my example. Close your door when you sleep, yeah, well you leave ours open to Yeah, we've got animals and the kids, like people need to get in and out. So uh, if you want to be like Mark and let us know a p s A to tell everybody we love doing those. We'll get to it eventually. Up promise. Um, you can go ahead and send us an email, wrap it up, spank it on the bottom, and send it off to Stuff podcast at iHeart radio dot com.
