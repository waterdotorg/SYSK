Welcome to audible podcast dot com. Slash stuff today for details. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. With me is Chuckles Bryant. How's it going, Chuck? I was chuckling. Yeah, I think that might have gotten caught. Yeah. I think that was an afropo nickname. Yeah, Jerry's funny like then she made me laugh. I know. Let's let's let's let's do this show. Yes, where's your awesome set up? My awesome setup is as follows. Chuck, are you do you consider yourself a happy person? Yes? I do? Well, then Chuck, you may be dumb? Really yeah? How so Well? There's this longstanding question of whether or not there's a negative correlation between intelligence and happiness. Take one Ernest Hemingway. He said something along the lines of, oh, I don't know, happiness and intelligent people is the rarest thing I know. I went up you, Oh drink buddy. Charles de gall reportedly said happy people are idiots? Did he really? And I don't know if he meant the medical classification of days gone by idiots. I think he just meant, you know, idiots mouth breathers. I've got one that's going to even top your Charles de gall One. Okay, Charlton Heston said you can pry my gun from my cold, dead hand. Yeah, he sure did. Was he happy? I don't know. I don't know. Happiness is a warm gun. That's what Paul McCartney said, and the Breeders man. We could just quote like song lyrics and people all day and end up with no results. So well, let's talk about this, chuck. Is there a negative correlation between intelligence and happiness? I mean, if you think about it in your own experience, you can make the case that ignorance is bliss, that kind of thing that, uh, you're you're happier when you don't know about something bad that's already happened to you than you are after you get the news. But that really has nothing to do with intellect. Well does it? Though? This when this whole thing is kind of fraught with questions for me, like is it emotional intelligence? We're talking about ignorance, Like when I think and you don't want to use the words like stupid, you know, I know Jerry says that schools don't like to use that word, and it's the word stupid. Yeah, it's a pretty negative word, I'll admit. And people that don't score well on high well on i Q testa me, and that means nothing about how smart they are. It's like, I think it has to do more emotional intelligence. And like when I think of dumb, I think and happy. I think of like the dude sitting there picking his belly button lent like laughing his head off at America's funny some video. Would you call him and elligent? I don't know. I kind of link that as one of the dummies out there. But I'm jealous of that because I watched that show in my and I just I can't sit still. It's just so awful. But some people think it's the funniest thing ever. I think it's kind of funny, and they seem really happy. You know, a guy gets kicked in the groin and everyone gets a good laugh and he falls on his face. And you know, Beavis and butt Head, they were idiots. They were always laughing and happy. And you couldn't laugh at that show either. No, it was funny, but I was laughing at their idiocy. I would consider you a pretty I don't know if intellectual is the right word, but definitely intelligent. I would considue an intelligent person. But I'm not intellectual in the least. You know that, but you're so. But I would also, I would say you're fairly happy. Yeah, but I could see you happier. Well, moods come and go, buddy. But you're saying you think you're generally a positive, happy person. Yeah, I'd say generally, I'm pretty happy person. Barring you know, I'm I'm moody as well, But that's that's in the jeans. So your questions as to this these articles are um like is intelligence, emotional intelligence or intellectual intelligence. I think what they're talking about specifically is um mental intelligence like book smarts. Sure, or I think you could make a case that street smarts comes out of intellect as well. I can. Okay, I'm not going to hear, but I could if I wanted to. Well, I think technically, they've they've done some studies that said there is no direct link between happiness and actual intelligence. Right, let's let's put some substance into this podcast so we can spiculate all day. Uh so, Yeah, officially what they say is there's no link. That's the official line on that. And thank you for coming and listening to this one. Yeah, no, there isn't any Uh. Actually that's not true because I found his study, Um, hit me. I found his study on the freakonomics blog. Actually is a couple. He drew data from a study of fourteen thousand people. That's pretty good and they were giving Yeah, it's a pretty good sample. Um. They were given a vocabulary test and then they were giving an analytical reasoning skills test. And the people in the top third consistently also reported being happiest, and they were less likely to be very unhappy people happy is and all that stuff. Not only here's here's the big problem. This is the problem with everything. Yes, this is here is our problem. No one actually knows what happiness is. It's a subjective experience, or if it even exists. I've seen a couple of people positive that the problem is. And here's the catch twenty two. All the people who are thinking about happiness are intelligent. If you're intelligent, or if you're not intelligent, you're probably not thinking about happiness. You're just happy. So the the whole field of the study of happiness shoots itself in the foot every time it opens its mouth. True, because it's all smart people trying to figure out what happiness is. And I can't think of anything that could make you unhappier than that. So let's just stop doing this medialy. We should. Well, we can talk about some little correlations here and there. I know that one researcher was talking about how our educational system doesn't really you know, they tend to separate the intelligent ones. So, in other words, early on in schooling, Uh, the really really smart kids are oftentimes segregated and uh put in special classes, betimes, even special magnet schools. They're not picked first on the kickball team. Uh. They're outcast in some ways because they're smart. And does that lead to happiness? Probably not? Yeah that Yeah, there's too many externalities that you can't really account for exogenous factors. Yes, nice, Wow, you have quite a memory of my friends. Recall from our super stuffed Guide to the Economy. Another problem with trying to define happiness is every study of happiness is a survey. It's all self reporting, and I can't remember it brings a bell that you had said like, um, we talked about this before, and you have said something along the lines of um, it depends on when you take that kind of test. Was. I mean, if if somebody tested you right now, how would you test in as far as the life satisfaction scale or happiness quotient goes, Well, she's just tough. I mean, like right this minute, Well, I'm in a pretty rotten mood today exactly, but I would have about yesterday, but I wouldn't call that. I wouldn't chart that on the life happen. Don't you think that the mood that you're in when you're taking, uh, when you're taking a look a survey on your life is going to influence everything. I would like to think that I would be able to step outside of that, but how can it not, You're right, yeah, So, so the whole fact that it's all self reported, I mean self reported data is almost always discarded in every other area of science. It's it's anecdotal Well, that's because this isn't really scientific if you think about it. No, it's not. And let's talk about something that's not scientific. It's a field, a new subdiscipline called positive psychology. Yes, that would be Um Martin us uh Seligman. Yeah. And you get the impression by the that his name is associated with something as ridiculously hippie sounding as positive psychology, that he's a crack pot. Uh, he is not. In fact, he's a PhD Uh. He runs the Center I think for Authentic Happiness or something like that at the University of Pennsylvania, so it is bona fide. He was the president of the Yeah, and actually he dedicated their millennial issue to positive psychology while he was president there. It was cool, but it was also pretty self serving. And uh, I'm sure he had his stocks on. I'm quite sure. Um. But the whole field of positive psychology is basically, Um, they're exploring interventions, and an intervention is any kind of treatment in the field of psychology. Right, they're exploring basically what positive psychology is saying is I read a quote in an article about it by another positive psychologist who said, uh, psychology is very good at getting people from negative eight to zero, but hasn't learned how to get people for zero to eight positive eight? Right, And that's absolutely true. But at the same time, I mean, like, are you supposed to get people to to positive eight? You know about that, there's some real ethical questions that are raised. Let's say that we develop some sort of um pharmaco psychiatric pill that can make a normal person happy. Should that person take that pill? I mean, we've already established as a society a baseline which is zero, and anybody below that is suffering from a mental illness and deserves treatment to get back to zero. Why should we accelerate our our happiness? And in doing so are we are we edging out real experiences? G the negative? I mean life is full of both, right, right, But are you gonna bring that home with the smart, intelligent or dumb stupid thing? Or is that fall into the ignorance bliss category? I don't know, I don't know how to categorize that. Man interesting, Uh yeah, No, I was actually going to go into um another kind of contrary therapy. Well, I don't know. You want to talk some more about positive psychology? No? No, no, that's good. Are you sure yeah, okay, all right, we'll continue on that. Have you heard of, uh, what is it? Acceptance and commitment therapy? I have not actually see. I have a leg up on you. I have to tell everybody. I've written a bunch of articles on happiness recently, and poor Chuck's been writing nothing but social media stuff, which is if this were about Twitter, I'd be sitting here silently. Yeah I would too, actually would you. Um. There's a there's a contrary field of therapy, uh to positive psychology. It's called acceptance and commitment therapy, and basically it says, like, look, you have good and bad experiences. You can't just focus on the happy one because you still have these negative experiences. You can't just crush him down or else you're gonna end up climbing a clock tower and shooting people. Right. So this, this therapy basically says what you do is you go back. And I've got a perfect example for you. When I was like five or six, we went to this k o A campground and I had like this awesome pac Man T shirt had like it was had the red ring around the neck and the sleeves and it was just like I think an iron on pac Man right, and Uh, I decided to stuff a pack of firecrackers down the front of my shirt stole him. I got away with it right, and my family was traveling back from this campground and we made it to uh Wendy's and stopped to eat, and I got up to go to the bathroom and the fire crackers. I was too scared to do anything with him. I just left him in my shirt for two hours. And so when I stood up, my fat stomach pressed him up against the pac Man shirt made this crickling sound. And my mom immediately looked at me, and somehow she's so intuitive. She looked at me and was like, what's in your shirt? And that was that? That was so bad, Like on my birthday. They took me home and showed me like all the he Man stuff I wasn't gonna beginning for my birthday that year. Uh, and they made me take it back and take the firecrackers to the guy. We turned around and went back. Yeah, it took the firecrackers back to the guy, and I had to apologize. I thought you were gonna say, they lit the firecrackers and under your shirt, and then yeah, push put them in my shirt and pushed me back into the store at the k A campground. Um, so that was something that definitely contributed to my outlook today. Like it's like it's still very much in my mind, and I wonder like just how much of that forms my personality, like how much guilt from that? So under acceptance and commitment therapy, basically I or anybody else would look at that and say, really, Okay, you stole a pack of firecrackers when you were six and you felt bad about it your whole life. Now that you're thirty two, is it really that bad? So you're basically becoming conscious of these experiences that are contribut beating to your outlook on life, that just accumulate all this crap. You know, I definitely subscribe more to act than to positive psychology. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. Me too. For sure, my shrink is real big on that. But just from a practical standpoint, it's not I've never even heard of use those words. It just makes sense to me. It's practical as opposed. Emily is always talking about people that bliss out and that sometimes she wishes that she has has that quality to just bliss out and like, you know, leave it up to the cosmos or Christians say they'll just leave it up to God and let him take care of it. And you know that's that's awesome if you can, If you can do that, but are you dealing with it? It's a great question, Chuck. The problem is we always say on this podcast to each his own. So if that is how you deal with life and it's working for you, fantastic, Well I can't do it anymore than you or Emily can't. Right, But if that means that you end up on the couch just laughing your head off, like I said it, America is funny some videos, I'm trying to think something worse than that. To be Saved by the Bell it's pretty bad. Okay, let's go with that. I find that show mortifyingly embarrassing. It is, and I still can't want I can't stop watching. It's like a train wreck. Do you remember the show Hey Dude, So Nickelodeon Show on Dude Ranch was bad. It was sort of like Saved by the Belbot on a Dude Ranch and worse if you can imagine that right there. Yeah, So, anyway, if that if that's your end result, and that's in your in your on the couch picking your boogers and eating them and you're smiling laughing. Then who are we to say, you know, whether or not ignorance is bliss or blessing out is the right way to go. Although possibly you should lay off the dope. Yeah maybe so. Doritos are in the mixer somewhere. So I guess the answer to this question chuck, our stupid people happier. The answers, we don't know, And whether you think that that's the case or not would definitely depend on whatever self reported anecdotal survey you read. Right. I think it's interesting. This is one I want people to log on to the blog when I do my Friday recap. I'd like to hear about this. I'd like to hear some opinions calling out I'm asking for it. Awesome. So, Josh, this was a cool and remember in our Body Farms podcast, how toward the end he said something about the lies perpetrated by c s I, the television show. Yeah, I love this email. This is really interesting, dude. Yes, indeed, all right, here we go. Uh, here's my first hand experience of the lies perpetrated by TV in general and c s I specifically. Five years ago, my wife was carjacked, robbed, and assaulted. She escaped by her own wits and strength. Her attacker had been smoking a cigarette during the attack. They fought over a knife he had that he had to her throat, and he cut her hands deeply. She pulled the cigarette from his mouth and tried to burn him with it, but it failed, which is that's a great movie move, you know, turning on the After she escaped and the police found the car, they found the cigarette, but with her blood on the filter. Under the blood they found his saliva, pulled the DNA from it, and found him in the CODIS data bank, which is the combined DNA index system, or as they call it, the bad guy Data Bank exactly uh, which is made tamed by the FBI. She went through the lineup at the local precinct where they made the arrest. The grand jury got the indictment, The trial happened, complete with the dramatic that's a man who did at moment and sentencing. After the case was closed, it was submitted by the county forensics chief and accepted by the FBI to be featured at that year's CODIS conference in d C. During every phase of the process, we were amazed at how much TV had lied to us about the process. The actual working in the system is someone like what you see on television as to be unrecognizable. During the conference, they openly spoke of the c s I effects. So it's basically these cops and forensics guys actually talk about how that show is damaging UH, their work, their lying liars, their lying liars, and how the public has been influenced so much by these shows. So basically, he hates those shows and he found it to be a lot of bunk. I did converse with him a couple more times via email, and he felt a lot of responsibility because he left a wife in a running car with the heat on and the radio on while he ran in to get ice cream for Lord. And this is when she was attacked and he had to say that in court, and he said, which made him feel like more of a jerk. Then she was attacked and uh, he said, was just like a TV show, except all the details of how it really goes down. So it's the drama was all there. Yeah, Jerry Bruckheimer systematically undermining the law enforcement community. But she fought him off, and this guy turns out had a rap sheet of like rape and rape and murder and they couldn't get him on the murder charge because something had happened I can't remember. So he ended up going to prison for life in the pokey in the houscal and the family of the raped and murder girl got closure. And you know, we're at the trial at this lady strial. So thank you, Christopher for that harrowing tale. Seriously, I think they should get T shirts. You think so? Yeah, dude, that's actually you know you went through this. We'll give you a T shirt that I know. I'm just kidding. Yeah, it sounds insulting you, Yeah, exactly. You you narrowly averted death by your own wits and you we'll give you a T shirt for that. We should make a T shirt. We shouldn't need it. Well, Christopher, if you want to send us yours, UH and your wife's UM T shirt sizes and address, we will make sure that those go out to you. Again, it's the least we can do. No insult intended just to show of support for bringing us this email. And if you have a harrowing tale of survival uh near miss with death um or.
