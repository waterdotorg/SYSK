Josh: Hey, and welcome to the Short Stuff. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, and it's short Stuff. Uh, this is a p S. A episode of Short Stuff. We like to do those kinds of things where we tell you to stop doing something that you're doing because it's harmful and you didn't know it. So that's what we're going to do here today. And also hat tip to my wife Umi, who sent me an article on this. Um had I had no idea about this, but um, we're talking about nose picking. We have to kind of start off first, Chuck, um, by establishing a link between the nose and the brain. Go uh sure, um. And this is going to relate to some particular brain diseases like Alzheimer's and and generally dementia overall. But when those things happen, it's super sad. And that's the result of plaque building up and protein tangles in your brain that are blocking neurological pathways and coming up the works basically, and over the years, they've kind of known for a while that like memory and smell or some of the first early signs and that's no surprise, but the University of Chicago Medicine has stumbled upon not stumbled upon, did some very intentional research that found recently that if you have a sudden loss of smell uh, and generally you're if you're in the age range. You know, if you're thirteen and you lose your smell for something, you probably have COVID. So don't worry. You probably got you did something wrong. You're being punished by God, that's right. But if you have a sudden loss of smell, it can be a very good early warning sign that you might be headed down um a road for dementia or Alzheimer's. Yeah. What was interesting is the link is so strong that the sudden loss of smell is as big a risk factor as having the literal gene that they basically say, like, this is the Alzheimer's gene, the apoe E four gene, Like you don't have to have that gene, and if you lose your smell suddenly, you're just as likely to develop Alzheimer's shortly after pretty remarkable finding, I think so too, so, Chuck, that was really well done. You established a link between the nose and the brain, which sets us up for the next part um, which is to say there is a connection between the nose and the brain physically as well, not just neurologically. That is problematic because researchers from UM the CLEM. Jones Center for Neurobiology and Stem Cell Research in Brisbane in Australia found that UM, picking your nose could actually be a risk factor for Alzheimer's as well. That's right. Uh. And they cavey at it, and we should cavey at it as well. That they use mouse mouses, these mices, mouse models to check this out, and they have definitely found that there's the introduction of a bacteria called chlamydia. Uh, I don't. I never have remembered, even though people wrote in how do you pronounce it when it's I A E at the end um I A. I think it's pneumonia. I mean, we've had very smart scientists and doctors say, guys, and did you see that it is pronounced this way? And I never can remember. I think it is a A. I mean if you just take the iowa A remember A on flux. That's how they fell bad. So I'm guessing it's pneumonia. Okay, So Clamidia pneumonia, which can be very dangerous, is very dangerous for the brain. Uh. And this bacteria goes from the nose to the brain and kind of kicks off the production of this amm alloid plaque, which is one of the plaques that can you know, kind of kick off Alzheimer's and dementia. Yeah, and what's interesting about that is that once this um this p pneumonia gets into your brain or your central nervous system and you start developing this amyloid plaque. That seems like a dumb thing to do since that's going to trigger Alzheimer's. But they found anti viral and anti microbial properties in amyloid plaque, so they think it might be part of our immune systems. Interest. You just you don't want this bug, not just for that, like it's it's been linked to a lot of other stuff too, because it's so effective at attacking our central nervous system that, um, they think it's possible that multiple sclerosis is the result of an infection of this bug. That's pretty crazy. Um. It exacerbates asthma. Uh, it can trigger material sclerosis, which apparently it makes us start absorbing L D L cholesterol, which inflames our our blood vessels. Which hardens them over time, all because this bug made its way into your body. So the upshot of this is that, um, these researchers in Brisbane say, don't pick your nose because all you're doing is helping this bug get in there in the first place. All Right, I think it's a great spot for a break and we'll come back and explain all that in a second. Alright, So the Australians tied this to mice. Uh, they came out and said, all right, we've tested the mice, now we need to test this on humans. But in the meantime, we are really pretty sure that it's bad for humans and that you shouldn't be picking your nose because you could get some of that bacteria on your finger and basically stick it up onto a highway that goes to your brain. Uh, it may already be on your hands, it may already be in your nose, in which you'll be shoving it up there further by picking your nose. And now comes to the second half of this episode where we're just going to talk a little more generally about picking your nose. Yeah, because what the uh, the C. Pneumonia um is not the only bug that you can push into your um, your nose even further. The problem with that one in particular is that it attacks the central nervous system. Right. Um. But picking your nose, like you said, is not um something you want to do in the first place. First of all, it's it's gross. It's I mean, you just know it's gross. But it can be dangerous too. But it also seems to be really really widespread chuck. Yeah, And I do want to point out really quickly, like the whole thing with COVID and masks, one of the reasons that they were telling people to wear masks was not just to keep from inhaling particles into your nose, but it was to keep your fingies away from your mouth and nose so you don't just like scratch your nose with a little COVID on it because it could be a carrier. So that's another reason people are saying to keep those masks on, because they found that picking your nose is literally shoving whatever bacteria you have on that index finger or thumb sometimes or pinky if it's in the little corner, and getting it closer to your brain. Right. So, there was this um study from out of Madison Wisconsin, and these researchers sent a thousand questionnaires out to people, and the questionnaires basically said, hey, we have a bunch of questions about um, picking your nose. You want to answer these? And two hundred and fifty four people responded that, and the response that they got was we all do all of us pick our noses? Of the people in the survey reported picking their nose said that they think everybody picks their nose. I thought everyone kind of pick their nose occasionally. I think they do. This study is criticized because, um, it could. It could very easily suffer from response bias. If you remember from our Scientific Biases episode that was one of them where only people who are actually interested in talking about nose picking and who are likely to pick their noses then would have been the ones who responded. So that would skew the results, but still is pretty significant. Yeah, I'll go ahead and say it. I picked my nose here and there if I'm in a situation where it calls for it. Sure, if I if I got a boogie up there and there's no tissue at hand, just get that thing out of there. I don't think it's that gross. I mean, boogers are kind of gross looking, but it's not you know, it's not like picking poop out of your butt. No, no, it's not at all. Did I just say that you did? Okay? Uh? For these respondents, I guess on one of the two fifty four, they were like you, I'll fill this thing out right, I'm a proud nose picker. Uh. For two percent of the subjects in this survey, which is not many, UM, it actually like and I think these are people who sort of obsessively pick. It actually interfered with their daily functioning. Uh. And people responded with how much time? Some people responded fifteen thirty minutes. There was one person that said they spend over two hours a day picking their nose and it caused various medical problems from uh, perforation of the septum um to this one lady. I think it was a different case study, but um, she perforated her septum and carved a hole in her sinuses from obsessively nose picking. Yeah, can you imagine. No. So, the these researchers UM concluded that nose picking is probably universal among adults at least, so it should not be con sidered a mental disorder alongside something like a trick to lamannia, where you pull your hair out. Um. And there's actually a name like that for nose picking, or at least compulsive nose picking, rhino to lexomania. Um. And they said we should get rid of rhino to lexo mania. It's ruined enough lives as a label. So let's just say everybody picks their nose instead rhino. How did you pronounce that, rhino to lexomnia? I don't think that's right. Are rhino till x? Oh? Yeah, it's a right. Oh well what am I looking at? Then? What is rhino trick to lemnia? Oh? So there's a one. There was a documented case of somebody who compulsively picked their nose and pulled their hair. So they've dubbed it that I didn't know if those nose here, because because getting after that nose here can be a problem too, man, that's stuff. Do you ever do that, pull out your nose hair? I do? Uh, it's very painful. But what I try to do is get in there with my Um. I've got I've got some really nice hair cutting scissors, which is just to say they cut very well and very precisely. So I try to because you know you can older, you get hair in your nose and your ears like you never had before. And you don't want to be that guy with like the crazy eyebrows and nose hair everywhere. It just busts out all over. You turn into like a cheea pet basically. So I try to take care of this stuff. So I get in there with the scissors. Um, when I'm thinking about it now, I'll trim the eyebrows, and I'll trim up the nose hair and then the ear hair. I don't want to stick scissors in there, so I'll just feel around in there and I'll pluck those and those are pretty painful to you should just get one of those little buzzer things do work really well for nose hair, and you're here. I used to have one of those. Oh I went analog? That was fine. Are you like analog, you hipster? No? I mean I literally just kind of lost it over the years and then never placed it. But a dynamic against it it was fine. So there are some other researchers to that did a follow up study in two thousand in Bangalore, India. Um, I remember our friend Van Nostrian's band was named the Bangalore's That's right. Yeah, I just wanted to mention that. And their their hypothesis was that, um uh, something like nose picking, that kind of habit finds its like origin in childhood and it just carries over into adulthood. That does not seem to be the case. Apparently nose picking becomes much more um appealing to you as you age. Because only seven point six percent of respondents, and of these teenagers who were surveyed said that they picked their nose. I'm guessing that they were given anonymity because it's a pretty self conscious question for a teenager. Um, but apparently it's it's an adult phenomenon more than a childhood phenomena. Yeah, I'm glad to know it was anonymous, because at first I was like, come on, I'm sure these teenagers were just like, well, I don't pick my nose. Oh yeah, I'm guessing it was anonymous, because that would have been a terrible study design if it wasn't. Okay, I got you, you know what I'm saying. Sure, I'm curious about all these numbers, so any this is just a tough thing to really quantify any survey, where you're asking people to admit doing something that may not be socially acceptable is pretty tough, totally. And socially acceptable is right because depending on where you are in the world, uh, it may or may not be frowned upon. Yeah. I think in the US, Uh, if you're not egregiously just digging in there going for gold, as I say, then you can get away with a quick little nose pick and you know, just sort of do one of those and people won't be think you're like a monster. No, they'll look the other way. Yeah. In the cars when you always see people in traffic, I always say, pick a winner, buddy, Well you're honking. I don't yell that that might just say it to myself. Um, in Japan, actually it's not. They don't really celebrate public nose picking, but um, by comparison, blowing your nose in public is way worse of a social faux pa for sure, which makes tough. It makes sense though, because um, they're very germ conscious in Japan. I mean they've they've been wearing masks since way before the pandemic. They're old school with that stuff. So I could totally see that being a big social taboo there. Yeah, blowing your nose in public. In public is one thing, but like in a restaurant, I'm always like, what do I do? I always feel like I should get up and excuse myself to blow my nose, and I try to unless it's kind of a you know what I'm saying, I want to get too gross here. But if it's like a quick little thing, it's not that big of a deal. But if it's something that sounds gross, like if you're really like releasing a lot of snot and you can hear that, then I think you should probably like excuse yourself. That's for the bathroom. And then China, apparently I saw there's a Wall Street Journal article where, um, the author moved to China and started picking their nose because they said that, um, nose picking in China is quote a way of life. Interesting but you're like, Okay, that's weird China. But apparently the author kind of choked it up to all of the soot that's in the air and some some of the major cities there that you just have to It's like every time we go to New York. At the end of the day, I picked my nose because I'm just getting all the crowd out of there. I can only imagine, you know, visiting Beijing, and of course you're going to pick your nose. Of course you got anything else. Nope, it's away life. It is chuck. Hats off to you for admitting you pick your nose. I'll admit it to see. Everyone picks her nose a little bit. It's a big deal. It feels good, man. Uh, it feels good to say. I mean also it can feel good to pick your nose too. That first nose blow the morning, too, is very rewarding. So I think short stuff is out, don't you.
