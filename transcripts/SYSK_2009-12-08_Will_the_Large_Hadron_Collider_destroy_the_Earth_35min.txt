Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as Charles W. Bryant, as well as our producer Jerry. You can just call me Boson Higgs Boson. No one's going to call you that. It would be a great name, though, Yeah, Higgs Boson. What up pigs. I wonder if that thing is discovered, if somebody will name their kid Higgs Boson, you know, Michael Wits or whatever. Well, if someone names her kid yet Detroit. I think someone could potentially name the kid Nigs Boson. There's a there's even a comma I think in there and there and yet Detroit. Yeah, I don't remember an exclamation point. Yeah, there's some sort of punctuation. When you get punctuation into your name. Your parents were messed up. Yes, Chuck's talking about a theoretical article called the Higgs Boson, and we'll talk about it in a minute, but first we're going to talk about the place where they're hoping to find proof positive that the Higgs Boson particle exists, yes, Josh. And this is very science heavy, super science heavy, because it's about science, so science heavy that Chuck and I um are a little nervous about this one. I'm not afraid you have dark matter using out of my ears, which is proof that it exists. Exactly. You just you just amended the standard model. Chuck. All right, let's talk about this, dude. What what what is this? We're talking about the large Hadron collider. Right, but you may have heard about, you may know a lot about, and if you do, I imagine we'll probably get some angry emails from you when we mess it up. And right, but on the border between Switzerland and France. Yes, a hundred meters underground, beautiful country. Sure, that's a good skiing out there. Sure, Um. There is a facility with track that's what seventeen miles long, think seventeen point seven sixteen points, we'll just call it seventeen seventeen Uh and around this track, Uh, they shoot beams of light. Pretty simple, It is pretty simple. And we stop now, Yes, we can that there there's a large had round collider, everybody, that's what it's called. It's called the Large had dron collider. Um it's been built. I think they started in the twenty first century and finally went online for the first time in two thousand and eight. So far, it's cost six billion dollars to construct. Yeah, I've heard any up to ten even depending on who. Yeah. Well, yeah, and there's a lot of countries involved. There's thousands of scientists who are going back to their home countries and saying we need more money, we need more money. Um and uh the the but yeah, France and um Switzerland to run in the show there. Ye. CERN is the name of the company we should point out right well, the organizations the European Organization for Nuclear Research abbreviated en Francais CERN. Okay, I was about to say those letters don't match up something here, So what is it, chuck? They shoot beams of like. It's a particle accelerator and it is the largest and most badass particle accelerator in the history of particle accelerators. True that that's the easiest way to say. We've got particle accelerators that look like um, old donkeys pulling carts with square wheels compared to this thing. Seriously, this is as big as it gets. It's as ambitious as it gets um. And basically, what they're trying to do our several fold. They're trying to prove the existence of the Higgs Boson particle, the god particle. Well, let's talk about this. Why why would anyone want to prove the existence of a theoretical particle? Should we go back to the standard model? Yeah? Should we back into this, let's do it. Basically, it tries to define the fundamental particles that make uh, the universe, the forces, the forces, right, You've got strong nuclear force, strong like bull, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force. So the standard model, which combines um Einstein's theory of relativity with quantum physics I believe um theory and all that other stuff you just said. It combines those two, uh, and it proves the existence that it counts for those three forces. The problem is gravity still remains unaccounted for. That's the fourth fundamental force, Like we can account for theoretically, but we can't say, yes, this is why gravity exists, and this is all the stuff gravity does. We're still with with strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and electromagnetic force. We've advanced leaps and bounds beyond classical physics, Newtonian physics. But we're still at the apple falling off the tree level. Uh, as far as this goes when it comes to gravity. So the Higgs Boson particle, if we find it, if we detect it um, it will fill out the standard model exactly. And it's a theoretical particle at this point that we're looking for, right, And they they think that it exists and that basically it's responsible for giving mass or matter mass right right, which is important, they say, because not all matter has mass, things called neutrinos, delicious and nutritious. Neutrinos do not have maths. I've practiced that one did. It's actually written down. Uh. So not everything has mass. And and the idea is that if you explain uh the existence of mass using the Higgs mechanism, we'll all be better for it and understand our origins. Ultimately, that's what it comes down to, is where like theory, theory is not good enough, we have to know, you know. So the Higgs Boston particle is one of the bigger ones named after Peter Higgs. By the way, physicists who theorized it um. How do you how do you know a theoretical particle when you see it. That's a good question. Do you know? This is what I understand, Um that you can't just say, oh, there must be this particle out there and name it after me. By the way, I think Peter Higgs went a little further and said, this particle must exist, and if it does exist, this is basically this is its um energy, it's mass, So find this name it after me, right exactly? And uh so if they what's going to happen when they when they turn the large Hadron collider on what this Christmas? Right? I think it begins the process which will take several months after that to collide. Yeah, they'll they'll have their sensors looking for particle that's created that has that I guess mass, that energy, that that whatever, um however, it's described mathematically. My stuff. It's coming out of my ears right now. So darker matter is another one that they're hoping to find, right. Uh, yeah, you've got to coming out your ears tell us about it, Chuck. Well, Uh, here's the deal. Dark matter is. Right now, humans can observe about four of all the matter that must exist in the universe. That's all we can account for. That's not very much. Uh, there's a theory that um dark matter is this undetectable matter and that coupled with the matter that we can detect, makes up only about which is still not much. And the other three quarters is what they think might be a force called dark energy, right, which UM. Scientists have become alarmed over the last few decades when they've detected that the universe is actually expanding and they don't know why well, and they think that dark energy may be the reason. Right, So they're looking for that too. UM. A lot of once you again, once you theorize something, you kind of have to back it up with, and this is what it's going to look like, right, and so that you you sense for it, right. Sure. They're also looking for anti matter, which is matters hated foe and they like to cancel each other out. Yeah, that's how it supposedly worked, is that there was more anti matter matters, right, more matter than antimatter when the Big Bang happened, which is how we're here. But they don't know why, and they're hoping and that is um, that is the hook, Chuck, what they're going to do. They want to find all this stuff and more, um by recreating the Big Bang, that the the what the universe looked like a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang? Right right, because we think what happened was the universe expands and cools and all these particles floating around join up together and form larger particles and then all of a sudden, what do you what do? What's what's the word evolution? Sure it starts rolling if you believe in that kind of thing, right, Um. They're also looking for some other stuff, um, slightly stranger stuff than you know, dark matter and anti matter. They're looking for evidence well, adherence of string theory. Are looking for evidence of string theory, which would we mean another dimension several up to eleven. I believe who I think theorized eleven. I don't buy string theory. Yeah, and you've always I have. I have a real problem, and it's most likely I just don't understand it. But from what I understand, very very smart people don't understand it either. Well, there's no compression that Kiku is like this is what he didn't come up with the measurements to back it up, you know, But you're on the same page as a lot of scientists, though they also say that it's it's a philosophy. It's not a science, right under his theory or under his philosophy, however you want to say it. Um, there's up to eleven different dimensions. We're currently aware of four um height, with depth and time. Yes, those are four dimensions that we exist in UM. Under k KU there's eleven total, so there's another eight that are unaccounted for UM, and that all matter in the universe is made up of tiny vibrating strength. Some are closed like little rubber bands, some are open like little um oh, I don't know, tape worms, like a cut rubber band, right, sure, And these strings can vibrate and like a guitar string, and uh, one vibration might make it look like an electron. One might make it look like a neutrino, delicious and netritious neutrino. And that's string theory and it's most simplest form. But even still, the strings are highly hypothetical UM, and even if they were created, we apparently wouldn't be able to sense them. What they're looking for the string theorists is evidence of supersymmetry, right, and supersymmetry is you have a particle and it has a UM an opposite particle like a neutron, and a positron positive and negatively charged an antiparticle. Sure right, Um, even further those are superpartners, even further into supersymmetry. And this will somehow, I guess, prove string theory. I don't understand how it will. But um, and oh my god, can you imagine the length of the emails we're going to get from people who explain how this proves string theory. I'm already uh, suffering from brain melt. I can't imagine anymore. So you've got the neutron and the positron, yes, and those are superpartners. But each of those have a UM positive partner to rather than an opposite, they have one that's like them as well. Each one has their own partners, So each particle will have three partner particles, three counterparticles, counterparticles, perfect chutes. So that would be supersymmetry. And apparently if they find evidence of supersymmetry, then but a boom, but a being string theory is right, right, and it also helps to explain dark matter, Yes it does, so wow, is anyone still out there? Yes? Sticks like this, everybody. We're muddling through this part, but it's about to get a little more interesting. There's like ten nerds that are like, this is the best thing ever know. They're like carving their knives. Yeah, ready to slice us up? Yes, um, so that's what they're looking for. And also I think this is what I find most fascinating about at it. Most of the scientists out there, I think there are very few who are looking for evidence at back up their theories. Most of them are actually hoping to learn like everything they know is wrong and there's all this new stuff so that they can go out there and figure out what how this fits here and all that. I find that very interesting. It's a very ambitious project. And as Strickland points out in this article, very comprehensive article. By the way, um there is no practical application for this. Yeah, it's all just to see what happens. Yeah, which is pretty cool to sink six to ten billion into you know. Well, and if you've ever seen the thing, I mean, the pictures of this, the hay drunk glider is just unbelievable. It's ginormous. It's ginormous. So what are they going to be doing, Chuck, how does this thing work? Uh? Well, Josh, there are eight sectors at the hay Drunk collider, and um, they basically use magnets to steer these beams of light, these protons in a circle, because otherwise it's just straight right. Do you love that part? Well? Yeah, because that's the only part that makes sense, right, Um, the the magnets are actually super cool, the right chuck. Yeah, Well, there's ninety magnets. If you want a little uh status statuts, this one stat heavy. So ninety magnets. Many of them weigh several times which is pretty uh, pretty big, pretty big. And they are cool Josh to one point nine degrees kelvin, which is negative to seventy one celsius or negative fahrenheit, which is just above absolute zero. Yeah. And the reason why they would want to cool and electro magnet um to just above absolute zero is there's very little electrical resistance when you turn that thing on, so it can operate smoothly, exactly ideally, right, because it's it's um. It's purpose isn't to, like, you know, to a jokey attract all of the pots and pans at a certain facility to it. I mean it has a purpose. It's steering beams of light, which is much more difficult. You go out there trying to steer a beam a light. I've trying. Yeah, it's tough. Okay, So well how do they cool it though? That's a pretty cool staff. They cool at using liquid hydrogen and helium, right, liquid nitrogen. Yeah, that stuff burns ten thousand, eight hundred tons of liquid nitrogen and sixty tons of liquid helium to to finish up right, that's pretty hardcore. Um. Okay, So you've got these magnets, and actually inside the magnets are pipes which are vacuumed. Yeah, we gotta have a vacuum. So basically, if you hear you've heard vacuum and almost absolute zero. Um. This sounds an all awful lot like outer space, like deep space exactly. Yes, Um, So they're they're creating a vacuum um to keep any particle outright, any particle could screw this whole thing up. So imagine that there's inside this almost seventeen mile track, there's nothing. They're creating deep space threet below the Earth's crust without the space jump. That's okay, So chuck a long this and also those UM the eight sectors. Each one is an arc, like you said, so it's basically one big circle. And along UM along this big circle are six stations basically, and each one of these is outfitted with you know, tons of centers is a hundred and fifty million centers I think UM throughout the whole collider um. And so each station is basically working to UM measure one thing or another. Right, And we could go into detail here, but this is really when people would tune out, but just suffice to say there are eight main stations where they're looking for or six of them. Six main stations, four of which are really ginormous collecting lots of info, and then two kind of smaller ones, right, and remember these they're they're collecting things like UM, information about radiation, sudden changes in mass, gravitational fields, electromagnetic fields, that kind of stuff, and then it's going to sort through. And actually, another interesting thing about CERN is that it's getting something like fifteen petabytes of data gathered every year, which is a fifteen million gigabytes, that's and they're constantly the sensors are constantly feeding back information. Yeah, would they say that was enough information to fill one thousand DVDs, which is not as impressive as I would have thought. I'm pretty impressed. Okay. Um, and they're actually using a grid computing, using off the shelf computers, which is pretty cool. Yeah, they just linked them together. Why they do that? Uh, it's more efficient from what I understand. Yeah, and it's cheaper, right, Um, they're saving Speaking of cheap, you know what's not cheap their power bill? Did you see that unbelievable thirty million dollars per year just to power this thing after they've already sunk between six and ten billion into it. And once this once this thing it's revved up. What they're going to do first? The first step, chuck, and this is like the big experiment. Basically, they're just shooting beams of light and then smashing them into each other. Okay, So what they're gonna do first is they're going to take hydrogen atoms. They're gonna strip them of their electrons, right, yeah, which produces protons. They're gonna take the protons and they're going to send them through a machine that fires them as beams. The PS booster, that's the accelerator, right. I think that's what gets there's a bunch of them, but that's what gets it going, right, So it's just a beam and then it's a right right okay, chuck. So when they get these beams ready, right, when the when the whole thing is ready to go online for the big experiment, uh sometime early next year hopefully. So the first step is to take hydrogen atoms and strip them of their electrons, which makes protons, right, and there we have our protons because this is ultimately as a proton accelerator, right. Um. What they do is they feed these into a machine called the line Nex two, which fires the beams of protons into the accelerator, which is the PS booster. Yes, and dude, that uses radio frequency electric field to push the protons along and kind of get them started on their journey to uh just below light speed. Right. It's like, yeah, get along a little proton, right, and well you're gonna meet some other guys later that are gonna whip you even harder. Right. Yeah. That PS booster makes them go from you know, a beam of light to a beam of light right right, Okay, it's a good way to say thank you very much. Um. And the magnets are going to come in. Now they're keeping these proton beams on track and the things going along pretty quick, pretty quick, and then the PS booster injecton into another accelerator called the super Proton Sinco tron. Hey, it sounds like a children's toy, it does. It's very expensive one. So the beams are now really picking up speed and they're divided into bunches. Okay, so you have just imagine one beam and it's divided um into I think hundred bunch and eight per beam per beam. Uh, and each bunch has one point one times ten to the eleventh power protons. And this is important to say that they shoot one counterclockwise and one clockwise in two different two different tunnels. So yeah, they're going different directions, but they're getting faster and faster, and they're actually coming very very close to the speed of light. At one point, remember this is a seventeen mile track. At one point is these beams are getting to their their top speed. They make eleven thousand, two hundred and forty five trips around the track per second. Stat of the year that it may be, dude, it's what is this mid November and that's the stat of the year. Yeah, more than eleven thousand trips around a sixteen mile track per second. If you ever wondered how fast the speed of light is, that's nine nine percent there. Yeah, but you gotta you gotta admit that, um hundredth of a percent is pretty substantial. I wonder how many any trips they make at the speed of light. Yeah. The fact that we have figured out how to do that's not h and I obviously humans have figured out I do this is pretty amazing. It works amazing or terrifying, which we'll get to in a minute. Yes, and then Josh, you know what happens? Then they converge. Yeah, they direct these bunches of beams of protons and to each other and kaboom, six hundred million collisions per second at that point. And I get the impression also that um it wasn't clear, but the beams can be directed towards one another at each of the six censor stations. Okay, I think so, because I think you have to have your centers right there, right right. We'll see that makes sense, we'll find out. So we're going by the way, I already booked as a trip. Um So what happens, Josh, is they theoretically they're gonna collide and they're gonna break up into small particles like quarks, and there their accompanying energy called gluon. You know, one keeps it all together, which is why it's called glue on. Is it really? Of course not. But quarks are really unstable and they will decay in just like a fraction at the second. But we have all these sensors to pick up what happens exactly exactly. Um. I think that's that's part of the problem with why we can't detect this stuff in the universes. It's already happened, right, and we're witnessing its effects, were part of its effects, right right. Um, So they want to recreate the beginning of the universe to see if these things really exist and what their effects are, etcetera, etcetera. Um, there's possibly going to be some other things that are created, uh inadvertently, Yeah, photons and muans and black holes chuck. Yeah, that's possible. It's very possible. Actually, even certain said it was possible. That's one of the critics. Uh. One of the things that critics point out is you may create a black hole and you may destroy the earth so much so that sue dudes sued them basically to try and stop it. And not just two dudes, um, a guy named Walter Wagner and Luis Sancho. Walter Wagner was the former nuclear safety officer for the large Hay Drunk Collider. He was like the guy who was in charge of safety, and he filed the lawsuit in the U. S. District Court in Hawaii to to file an injunction to create an injunction to stop that thing from being turned on. Because you know what a black hole is. It's a bad Mama jamas where it's h I love. How Strickland puts it, black holes are regions in which matter collapses into a point of infinite density. Not good, No, it's not. And uh again, as Chuck said, Cerin has said, yeah, maybe they may create some black holes, but really teeny ones. Well that's what they're saying. They're saying, Yeah, the black hole, you know, and love is a star collapsing on itself. We're talking about um sub atomic particles collapsing on themselves. So it's a black hole, but you know it's gonna be tiny. Um. One of the Uh. The concerns that Wagner in Sancho have is that, sure, it may be tiny, but no one's ever done this before. And you guys have no idea whether this is safe or not. Just too much unknown, right. And they're like, no, no, our magnets are safe. They're they've been tested. They're like, we're not talking about the magnets, we're talking about all this stuff. You have no idea what's going to happen. And they also said, I love the response. One of certain's response was and there's no one allowed down in there while it's going on, right, And they're like, um, dude, what about the Earth? Yeah, being swallowed up into a black hole? Sure, forget the one scientist that's you know, wants to watch the explosion, forget him. Yeah he can write out of the black hole what's going on down there? You know? Yes? Uh Josh, And you know what, you know what else they think they might produce the strange lit Yeah, yeah, these things are a little scary. Yeah, it could be worrisome. Uh, strangelets could possess a gravitational field that could convert them and the entire planet Earth into a lifeless hulk. Right, They think that strangelets have this um they have. They're very dense. I think they're theoretical as well, right, Yeah, the hypothetical um they they apparently have the property of lending their incredible density to any other particle it touches and setting off a chain reaction, kind of like rogue from X Men, kind of. I think there's a lot of quantum physics and the X Men in my p brain. That's what I'm gonna think. So, um, they're worried that if a strangelet is created, it could set off a chain a chain reaction that turns all matter on Earth into this ultra dense, dead like lifeless hulk, including us on Earth because we're on Earth. Yes, but certain dismisses that for a few reasons. They say, Um, first of all, that it's hypothetical, so we don't even know that, so don't get your panties in a wide yet. Um. I believe that's what the memo said, actually, And then they said, actually, there's an electromatic field that would really pell normal matter instead of changing it, so don't sweat it. Then they say, even if it does exist, it would be really unstable and would probably just decay like instantaneously, like those black holes. Right. And then the final thing they say is that high energy cosmic rays would produce this stuff naturally anyway and should be hitting the Earth already, and we're still here, so don't worry about it. The one that I have the real problem with was the third one that should decay almost instantaneously. Should Does it really do well? No? I mean, does it really take a very long time for a strangely to transfer that to set off an inaction? That's true, We'll find out if the world's a lifeless hulk this uh, this February. Sweet. Um, there's a couple of guys, remember that Higgs boson particle that we talked about at the beginning, right, Um, there are a couple of guys who are actually very well respected physicists, right, chuck. Uh, That's what I'm told, who have um come up with a couple of papers that they basically say, and these are real physicists, These are real respected physicists, and they're not joking. They're saying that the Higgs boson has already been created in the future at CERN at the Large Hadron Collider. And it was so abhorrent that it rippled back in time and sabotaged itself so that it could never be created, sabotaged the LHC so it can never be created. So what's what's the analogy they're liking it too? Coming back from the future to kill your father so you will never be born your grandfather's whatever. That's actually a paradox. You can't do that, or else you never would have been born in the first place, exactly. But they make the case that it's not a paradox to travel back in time to push your grandfather out of the path of an oncoming bus, which is they're what they're saying the Higgs boson is doing. And the reason they say this is because it has failed on a spectacular level so far. Has there's some strange things, you could say, well, for there have been some strange ones. The first one wasn't that strange. It was a coolant leak, and uh, it destroyed a lot of the magnets, which was pretty expensive to fix. So that knocked it off track for quite a while, off track literally, and um then Josh, you know what happened last week? A bird dropped a baguette, a piece of bread into this thing. Yeah, into one of the magnets. This is really what happened. Yeah. Can you believe that? I can because I'm kind of with the two physicists who think that the boson has been created and traveled back in time. Yeah. So this bird drops us into a piece of the outdoor machinery and uh overheated the parts of it, and it was not operational at the time, but they said that it produced such a spike that if it had been turned on, that dropping this bread would have enabled the automatic fail safe and it would shut it down. Piece of bread from a bird. That's a little hinky, it is, But at the same time, if you think about it, it's not really that hinky. But this everyone is so everyone paying attention is so like this could be really great or it could conceivably end life as we know it. And see what happens. So anything that happens to it, um is just hugely under the microscope. Yes, yes, um, And I just realized that I was agreeing with the string theorist. One of the physicists is Holger beck Nielsen and his um compatriot Japanese physicistem say Oh Nino Mia. And these are the two that are saying that the Higgs boson was created and traveled back in time. They have a very easy way of solving whether or not the LHC should be put online. How's that a card game? Really? Yeah? They want to come up with basically, let's say a hundred million cards and million thousand and ninety nine of these cards say go ahead, right, and then one card says shut it down. And obviously this is all software, not actual cards. And then you ask the LHC to pick one, and if the LHC picks the one that uh says shut it down, then we should shut it down. Shut it down. Then it's fine. Wo Yeah. Are they actually gonna do this? I don't think I don't think so, because they have no say over certain anyway. You know, they don't. They're they're not related to Swart, but like I said, they are both respected physicists and the physics community. When they first heard about this, for like, and then they read it and they're like, yeah, yeah, because it is possible hypothetically, and if the LHC is involved in anything, it's hypothesis and theory big time. And until it proves everything or destroys the universe. We should say to that this uh baguette in the works has not thrown it off schedule. Apparently this time just shut it down for the time being, the chilling schedule. Like you said, I think they're gonna start cranking it up sometime this winter and then they're gonna break for Christmas and come back and then booms. See what happened, Chuck. I propose and I also proposed this to all of our listeners having a big old party on the day that they do this, because it could be our last could be. I also want to point out that I just saw this in the news today. One of the scientists was arrested in France as an al Qaida suspect. Mhm. Is that weird? And of course they're saying that this has nothing to do with al Qaida trying to get their hands on the LHC or anything like that. It was just kind of one of those things. And there's I think seven thousand scientists working on it, so you know, it's not that big of a deal. Oh, I guess it is for him. He's in big trouble. Yeah. So that's the LHC, the Large hay Drown Collider yeah, and probably talk about it again at some point in time, don't you think. Yeah, we should follow up when it happens. If it happens, and uh, I will probably read one of the emails from one of the physicists that write in and let us know how per symmetry could prove string theory, right, yeah, I look forward to that. Yeah. So if you want to read this article, I strongly recommend it. We didn't cover all of it's good good article written by Strickland. You can type in large hay drawn collider in the search bar at how stuff works dot com and bring your drip pan to catch the melting brain the anti matter that it's dense and uh, I guess it is now Chuck, it's time for a listener mail, right, yes, it is, Josh. My favorite portion of today's show. We're gonna call this um a response to my my admission that Emily and I fight before every plane trip. When I said that, so we have someone out there that agrees that are not agrees, but it happens to her in her husband as well. They've been married for sixteen years and every time before we take a trip, my husband has a major anxiety attack. And acts like a total a hole. I know that's what it is, and I am pretty tolerant, But until he's on the plane or in the car, he refuses to acknowledge the reason for his tension or even that he's particularly grouchy, which is what I do. So a few days before we travel are always fraught and we always end up fighting about the only time we do fight. Once we're on our way, he's fine. I'm still totally aggravated though, from him being such a jerk earlier. This snivid married sixteen years and it's not just talking. Earlier this year we went to Chile for a month, and when I booked the flights, I seriously considered getting separate seats. I threatened it next time, I'm booking my flight a few days earlier than his. Anyway, just wanted to share this so you know you're not alone. That's night. As always, thanks for the great podcast. The site is great in general. Searching for unicorns linked me to some information on hardy roses, which I had actually recently been looking for, and that is from Anne in New York City, and A says, as a ps, I could not find your team on Kiva. How do I find it well, and you can find it ask by going into the U R O bar of your web browser and typing w w W dot Kiva, dot org, slash team slash stuff you should know and Chuck, Uh, there's all the more reason. By the way, I wanted to say, I could not be prouder of our team, Chuck. The stuff you should know Army is awesome. We're at straight up a more, are we really? Yeah? Something like seven d fifty members and seven loans were in four weeks. Everybody we donated twenty thousand dollars. That's phenomenal. And Colbert has already been left in the dust. His his his leaky team is is donating like eight grand. I think they might be at nine grand so far. Chuck and I actually issued a video challenge to Mr Colbert. We did. We want to see who can be the first two what we decide on um a hundred thousand dollars. I think that's a pretty pretty big undertaking, I would say, but I think we can do it. So everybody, we have challenged Colbert's team to see who can get to a hundred thousand. Yeah, and you know he's ignored it so far. So if anyone knows Mr Colbert, or if anyone has any connection with this show or you're a fan, go smack him on his big fat head and tell tell him about the little challenge. Damn right, That's what I said.
