Join Josh and Chuck, the guys who bring you Stuff you Should Know, as they take a trip around the world to help you get smarter in a topsy turv economy. Check out the all new super Stuffed Guide to the Economy from house stuff Works dot Com, available now exclusively on iTunes. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Chuck Bryant, right, Josh, you want to bite? I thought you loved me mine, dude, pick two bites. But it's got high fruit toast corns for it in it, so well, you know what they say about that stuff? What that it's uh that uh that it's made from corn, has the same calories as sugar, honey, and it's fine and moderation. You only brought one the end and seen, Chuck. I feel dirty right now. We were clearly riffing on popular commercial yes, touting high fruit toast corn syrup. Yeah, um, which is kind of a big deal these days, right Chuck? It is indeed? Yeah, So Chuck and I are going to talk about um high fruit toast corn syrup, and you know, maybe some of the concerns what it is and whether or not it actually is bad for you. So we will get to that right this moment. Right, And welcome to Matt, our guest producer for the week. Yes, thank you for Matt for filling in for Jerry, who is on vacation hopefully not enduring any life threatening circumstances as is usually the case. Right, And we love young and talented Matt, so welcome. Yeah, young talented and well groomed Matt. How's it going, Matt? Alright, so on the high fruit toast corn syrup. Chuck. Okay, so this stuff didn't exist before nineteen fifty seven. Did you know that? Okay? Um, let me explain. Let me explain a little further. Okay, Um, So in ninete some researchers figured out that you could take a glucos and corn syrup. I think corn syrup is like all glucose, and glucose is uh one of our primary energy sources. And did you know that insulin's job is to actually go in and basically open the cellular membrane to let the glucoast in for burning. Okay, um, well anyway, so if you want a lot of energy, you could basically pound a bottle of corn syrup, just playing old corn syrup. Um. But these these researchers figured out in nine that if you added a couple of enzymes at different stages, you could convert glucose into fruit toast and fruit tose josh, as you know, is naturally occurring. It's a simple sugar. It's produced by a lot of different plants, and it's really really sweet, and it's more soluble in water than glucose, which is also a simple sugar. So that's why it's good for things like soft drinks and products like that. Plus it's also cheaper. Well yeah, sure, and we'll get to the reason why it's twoper in a minute. Did we mention my cold in this one? Uh no, you have a cold. I have a terrible cold. Everyone. I'm very sorry if I do that, so in advance, right right, But we also should say really quick to just so people have their sugar understanding. There's also table sugar is what people probably think of a sugar that is sucross, and that's what you get when you combine fruit toast and glucose. Well that's what UM high fruit toast corn syrup is as well. Is it common. It's sucros too, it's just in a slightly different amount. There's about tim percent more fruit toast and high fruit toast corn syrup than there isn't common table sugar, which doesn't sound like a lot initially it doesn't, but don't don't give it away. Yeah, okay, so UM seven they figure this out, there's the enzymatic action and then budda boom baha, being you've got high fruit toast corn syrup. I get the impression that at the at the time it was probably a very costly process. And then in the seventies people went back to it and and uh they basically UM perfected the process made it cheaper. Now, the concept of like using UM high fruk test corn syrup really dovetails nicely with what we hear in the States called a farm bill, and that is this massive bill which they they deliberate every five or seven years. I'm not sure, actually I can't remember either. Um anyway, Uh, the farm bill uh gives tons of money to corn producers to the point where, uh you can overproduce corn corn we do not need because everybody's got a cob in their mouth, and um, they'll still get money for it. Plus, corn is useful in a lot of different ways, so like corn syrup, and so we have an abundance and over abundance really of corn and chuck out. That's absolutely true. There was, Um you can use corn and ethanol. You can't use it in high freak toast corn serrup. The thing is is we used to before the seventies and we we started throwing corn into corn syrup production. Um, we used to send a lot of that surplus corn to Africa right as food aid. So in the seventies, on the day that they perfected the high fruit toast corn syrup process, some poor Ethiopian uh shuddered and didn't know why that was why. Oh yeah, food aids definitely dried up. And people also make the argument that the same we're gonna have an even bigger problem with with food, not just exporting it, but here too if it becomes a viable fuel like ethanol. So they're basically going to be using up the corn for the high fruit disc corns are up ethanol, and there's not enough to feed the world. Is that what you're saying, they'll use it for whatever they can make the most money off of. Obviously, good point. Yeah, um so okay, so that was my little aside, my little hippie liberal aside there, Chuck, very nice. Okay. So in the seventies we've got the high fruk toast corn syrup thing down and the world becomes a wash in the stuff. It's in absolutely everything it is, and it's in products that you would never even think associate with sweetness, like it becomes. Corn syrup isn't very sweet initially, but high fruit dost corn syrup is really sweet, and it's in things like crackers that you wouldn't even imagine. And they're starting to put it in meats too because it's a great preservative. So that's again, there's only ten percent more fruit toast in high fruit toast corn syrup than there is a regular table sugar, and everybody knows you should eat sugar and moderation, right, So, um, I guess approaching it in that respect, you wouldn't really think that there's any kind of problems with it, right, But it's really taken hold it has And also this I think the thing that that really started to generate concern is over the past couple of decades, it's become clear that about the time high fruc toast corn serr replaced table sugar um in um products like soft drink, that kind of thing. Um, the incidents of type two diabetes and obesity in the US started to climb as well. Right, I got a step for you. I want to hear if you're talking, how much it's really taken over the other sugars. In nineteventy more than of sweetener consumed in the US was sucros by It dropped to almost in half, and the rest of the sweetener sent was hyproc dose corns scrupt and that was at seven. Now I bet it's even off the charts here, it's even more prevalent. Yeah and and uh so yeah, so public opinions starting to turn, which is why the Cord counselor somebody started the ad campaign. Right, um, and uh, what's what's the problem. Well, the problem is I got another stat which is kind of indicated. Uh. They did a study in of middle school students and they found that nearly one third of their caloric intake was added sugars and we're not talking about like fruits and vegetable sugars. No, those are called natural sugars. They're not usually taking into account when you're talking about sugar intake. Added sugar and stuff like high fruit toast corn service not naturally occurring. So one third and so in two thousand five they didn't not a study another study. Sorry, and Americans uh that year consumed forty two pounds of high fruc dose corn sup per person. Okay, but again you can say, well, they could be consuming table sugar in the same amounts. They could be getting the same caloric intake from table sugar in the same amounts. What's the problem? Why is everyone picking on high fruit corn STARp. Do you want me to tell you that sounds like a great set up? Okay, thanks, I just set myself. You know, there's like self aliops, you throw it up and then you jump up and slam it. You dunk it. Have no idea a boomerang, I don't know. It's like a frisbee that you can play with by yourself. We'll go no, it's not like that at all. It's basketball. Uh. Since Australians writing in now, yeah, we just raised their ire um again, I'm going to set myself up. Do you want to know why, I'll tell you why. Here's the problem with fruit toast our bodies don't use it like we use glue coast Like glue coast is such a common energy source for us that we can metabolize it just about any way. It can go to just about any cell or organ or you know, um, anywhere in the body and say hey, metabolize me pal, and all of a sudden, we've got some energy. Right with fruit toast um, there's only one organ that can possibly metabolize it, and that's the liver. And the liver has a certain limit of what how much fruit toast it will process in their energy, and after that it turns them into triglycerize, which we like to call facts. So that's one of the problems. Well. And and and since it's in everything from like bread to crackers and things that seemingly and meets for preservatives, it's, uh, we're getting way way too much of it. Sure, it's kind of like that episode of Seinfeld where like everybody's eating this low fat yogurt. You can't believe it's low fat, but it turns out it's not they had it tested exactly. So everybody's putting on all this weight. And I think that's kind of what happened to America over the last couple of decades, where unknowingly consuming this tremendous amount of sugar uh and it gets converted into fats very easily, and all of a sudden, we're a fat diabetic nation. I've got some stats. I love your stats to your hand on my knee while you read them. I will UH. In two thousand seven, and this is kind of makes sense. Colorado is the only state in the whole country with less than of his population uh qualifying as obese healthy. Yeah, they hike in all that stuff, which is good. Um. And another one as far as diabetes goes, between ninety four and two thousand four, uh a new diagnosed ease of type two diabetes increased by which is a big jump. And a lot of people think that the the HFCs has something to do with that. Ye. Wait, a way to throw an acronym in there, buddy like that? Yeah. Yeah. Can I say one other problem with fructose, okay, it is that there is ten more in high fruc toose corn syrup than in regular table sugar, and when you start to eat a lot of it and it starts to appear in all sorts of different foods, that ten percent really starts to add up. So that would also account for why we're a much a meteor country than we were before. Except Colorado. Of course, everything's fine in Colorado. Um. But but ultimately, again back on the metabolic level, UM, there's been studies that show that the taste of artificial sweeteners or added sugars like high fruit toose corn syrup actually make us want to eat more. And it's not has nothing to do with what we're doing with that metal. Likely it's the taste we love to taste so much. It's like crack to us. So when we eat something that contains glucoset right, um, and when we eat anything generally, uh, there's this chemical that's producing the stomach is called grellin. I know it's it's kind of terrible name, but it's actually really important. Grolan travels up to the brain and says, okay, stop, this person doesn't need to eat anymore. Here, she's full. We got all the nutrients we need down here, so just cut it off for a little while. And then well, you know, another chemical will let you know when we're hungry, right, Um, we don't produce grilling when we eat fruit toast, so the brains never getting those signals that it's used to getting saying stop. So, which is why you can sit there and eat Little Debbie brownies by the box full all day long. Yeah those are good. Twiss cake rolls ain't too bad either. Yeah, not to pick on Little Debbie. It's a Little Debbie is a fine, fine company and are from the only company using high fruit tose corn. It's everywhere, It's everywhere. So, Josh, I think we're at the point now where we can talk about what you can do if you're worried about something like this, which well, clearly everything in moderation, just like the cheesy little commercial says that we mocked. Um. But what you need to do is you need to start checking the packaging of your of your foods, and better yet, you can try to start avoiding package foods as much as you can. That's really where it's at. I mean, I had a friend that had high blood pressure and his doctor said, you can do a couple of things. You can either get on this medication or you can start eating fresh foods and avoid package foods. Medication. No, yeah, absolutely no. No, he controlled it through diet, dude, and he quit buying anything in a box, anything in a package. He fresh like in the yard. Yeah, he ate fresh fruits and vegetables. He ate meat, um, and his blood pressure dropped dramatically. Meats he found in the yard. Cats he raised cattle in his good but um, yeah, I mean it's always best to avoid packaged foods. When you look at any kind of packaged food ingredients, it's it's kind of frightening what's in there. Well, one of the problems is that high frue toast corn syrup is substantially cheaper than regular sugar. It is, so that means the food prices are cheaper, which is I guess by extension or my hypothesis or theory, I would say, because I'm sure it's been tested. Why the poorer classes also tend to be the most malnourished because the stuff that they're eating is so processed, so packaged, and so chuck full of not just stuff like high fruit toast corn syrup, but all sorts of other preservative that we shouldn't be eating. But are cheap and allow companies to produce cheap food. It's a horrible vicious cycle. But I mean, try try eating organic in this economy. Pal, you can't do it. You have to be like filthy rich to eat organic these days. But you know what's not cheap? What the diabetes? No, that's true. It's an excellent in hospital stays and heart attacks. Uh so that's great. Do yourself a favorite. You'll save some dough in the long run if you if you eat better and take care of yourself. Plus you'll keep your foot. Yeah. True. So there's high freuk toast corn syrup. Um. We I guess we'll just sit back and expect an angry season desist letter from the corn Council or somebody right right, we love corn corns great, I love corn on the coblic You would not believe me too, It's one of my favorite anyway. Um, that's high freak toast cord syrup. And followed by our disclaimer that Chuck and I actually do like corn and American farmers in America in general. So there you go, And are we plugging anything these days? We can give a quick mention to the blog. You know, we have a blog on the website you can access, and I think most folks are catching on. Now we're getting some good numbers, and hell, let's plug the thing that we're making money off of. Well yeah, sure, okay, the super Stuff Guide to the Economy with Josh and Chuck. You can buy that for four bucks on iTunes and learn about econom x and get a little better understanding of what's going on in the world. And uh, it's a time for listener mail. Yeah, Chuck, So Josh, I was impressed with this one. This is uh not a high kup, but it is a poem. And a seventeen year old named Daniel in Colorado wrote us a sonnet. There's like more than an eight percent chance he's not obese, okays in Colorado force Alright, so here we go. From Daniel, I would that there were just one reason why the podcast did delight me fully, so that I might be in hasty time. Supply a nicely packaged blurb so you might know. I'll ask. No single reason will suffice. The podcast is a pleasure labyrinthine. To try to craft a reason too precise would make a burly rope of stingy twine. But in those fleeting moments in the night. One wonders does one really need to know whether one can really die of fright? Or if How Anger Works is at proposed? But though it may be triviality, the podcast comes to us completely free. How about that? That was great? I couldn't write one of these. Oh no, definitely not. Try try fitting labyrinthine in So Daniel in Colorado, seventeen years old? You is he? Is he an adult? He's seventeen? Okay? Great, good to know that he may or may not be an adult either way. Thank you very much, Daniel. We appreciate the effort, and we've always also said you can only gripe so much because it is free, right sure. Thank you for supporting that point. If you want to send us a gorgeous poem, or just type the word labyrinthine and uh in an email and send it to us, um, you can shoot that over to stuff podcast at how stuff works dot com for more on this and thousands of other topics.
