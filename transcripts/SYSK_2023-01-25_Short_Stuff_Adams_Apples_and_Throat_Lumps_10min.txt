Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, and we've got two Adams apples between us, and that makes this short stuff, that's right. Uh. This was another one where I just, all of a sudden, I saw a guy with a very prominent Adams apple, and I don't I don't have a very prominent Adams apple, do you know. I just don't think I've got a pretty wand Adam's apple. Yeah, so we're both just a couple of low voice squeaker squeaker fellas. I've got like Adams coume quat. Now that I really think about it, I might have like a grape. I can barely feel that thing. But we're talking about Adams apples here. Uh that if you if you don't know, I don't want to be the podcaster that assumes everyone knows what that is. Uh. It can it can be that prominent bump in the sort of center throat of usually as we'll see a man. Uh, and let's talk about it. What is that? Well, according to the Bible and Bible types, Adam, the original Adam was taking a bite of that forbidden apple and some of it got stuck in his throat, which cursed all remaining men to come to be born with a symbol of that forbidden fruit sticking in his his throat. And I love this article from I think from how Stuff Works said that's folklore, but in reality, the Adam's apple is a result of a boy's voice box larynx growing. That's right, uh and big thanks to how Stuff Works with this in Jennifer Sellers, the author and the Healthy dot Com And I love this one. Harley Street e n T nice. If you want to learn about the throat, go to an ear nose and throat place. Sure, for sure, that's their motto. Yep, it's a little self serving, but it is their that's right. And here's the deal. It is um. It is cartilage, and it starts out usually during puberty, and it is your your larynx. It is your voice box getting bigger and bigger, and your voice will get deeper. And so I was like, hey, does that mean if you have really prominent adams apple, you're more likely to have a deeper, more booming voice. And that's that's true. Oh, that makes total sense. Yeah. The reason it's associated with men typically is it's activated. Um that growth of it is activated by testosterone, an increase in testosterone during puberty. But that's not to say that girls larynx and larynx is yeah, don't grow as well. They just don't typically grow as prominent as boys do. And partially as a result of that, women have higher voices, usually because their larynx is smaller, uh than a man's larynx. Right, so you're less likely to grow up looking like I feel like Adrian Brody has a prominent adoms apple. Totally. Yes, that's a great example of that. I'll just watch that movie you told me to watch, which one, the sort of murder mystery in the theater? See how they run? Yeah, very very enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I started watching a horror series that he's in from the set in the eighteen sixties or whatever. UM called Chapel Weight, and apparently it's like a prequel the Salem's Lot. Maybe I'm not sure. I haven't figured that out, but interesting, It's okay, I'm I'm on. I just finished episode one and I'm deciding whether or not to start to You've become quite the horror aficionado. Here, it's true in your middle age officiate time. All right, So that's the difference of the size of the Adams apple. Again, that's not to say that, uh, a woman could have an atom's apple that you see and notice and can be prominent. Uh. There could be several reasons for this. It could be a genetic thing, it could be because of a horror monal imbalance that happened during puberty. It could just be an anomaly. Um. But that's like it can be, Um, it can be problematic. I think that sometimes that's such a trait that you might associate with, uh, with with men that I think if a woman has one that's a little more prominent, that they might be embarrassed by that. Uh. You can get surgery for that kind of thing. It's called the feminizing condo lorange of plastic tracheal shave. Tracheal shave. Yeah, I'd rather be called the feminizing condo Lorarangeoplastic tracheal shave sounds very painful, but it's apparently not. It's apparently a pretty safe procedure. And women with Adam's apples, who by the way, Meg Ryan, Sandra Bullock, Miley Cyrus all known to happen. Ohm, I at least got that that deep voice. Yes, she does for sure. Um uh. But if a woman is self conscious about that, she might have that procedure or for trans women, that's often a part of it's often a procedure that they undergo. But although the growth of the larynx leads to higher lower voice, depending on how big it is, um, if you do a tracheal shave, that doesn't affect the voice. Um. Yeah, you have to undergo voice feminizing surgery where they actually go in and alter the length of the vocal cords. Wow. Very interesting. I'm glad you looked that up. All right, Well, let's take a break here, bruminate on that, and we will come back and talk about sort of adjacent idea, which is when you get the sadds and you get a lump in your throat. Chuck. I am so psyched about this. This was the thing that I didn't know I wanted to know about. And it's great because it's fully explicable. I love those. Yeah, the idea that you are and it's usually a situation where I feel like it's usually situation where you may not be able to just burst out in tears. Maybe you're trying to hold some emotion back and you go to swallow, it feels like you've got a chunk of Havardy cheese in your throat and it's very uncomfortable feeling. I think we've all had it, and that's you know that. You call that a lump in your throat. Yeah, it's also known as the globus sensation or globbus because it's a great band name. Yeah, I think so. Um it's it all centers around the glottis, which is the opening between your vocal cords that you can breathe through. And um, well let's explain this. Okay, when you feel lump in your throat and you're stre u stout, the point to your body is that you're stressed out, and so the automic autonomic nervous system kicks in fight or flight. Remember old old friends, fight or flight We've talked about all the time. Well, to your autonomic nervous system if you're if you're in a stressful situation, it makes no differentiation between whether a bear is coming at you or the entire stadium at the World Series is booing you, does not matter. It treats it the same way. And what it does is it prepares you to fight or flight in one way that you do that is by breathing in better So it opens your glattis big time and lets the oxygen into that you can start getting that blood pumping and those muscles moving. All right, So that's a good first part of the response. Um, so what's happening, literally is your your glottis opens wide open because your body basically is saying you need to run in the other direction and get the heck out of here. In in in order to do that, and most efficiently, you need to breathe in more oxygen. So we're going on engines. Uh, we're going balls out, literally, is what we're doing. And we're gonna open that glottis as wide as possible. But if you're laying on the couch watching uh uh Brian's song, what's another sad movie? That's a boat old reference? Um, ordinary people? Okay, sure, I watched that on a plane recently. Very dull. Really yeah, I never saw it. It's just it's early eighties to me. No, that's really good. Or terms of endearment, let's say, or steel magnolias, when which Shelby does old yeller, I'm sorry to spoil steel magnolias. Oh yeah, geez that man. So, if you're laying on your couch and your body is saying get up and run down the street away from whatever this is stressing you out, and you're lying there trying to swallow, you're just having a hard time swallowing because in order to swallow, your glottis is supposed to close, right, but your glattis is wide open because of your autonomic nervous system, and they're in is that lump in the throat. And the reason why you feel like swallowing, and the reason you get a lump in your throat is because you're actively trying to fight back tears. And one way to fight back tears is to hold your breath, which you need to close your glatties for, or you swallow what you need to close your glads for. And so those two opposing forces, trying to close your glasses and keep your gladss open is what gives you that lump in the throat sensation. Boy, the hunk of I've already was tastier, but this is this is pretty tasty to totally. You got anything else? I've got nothing else. This is uh, this is a good perfect shorty. I think I agree. Perfection has been achieved, which means short stuff is out. Stuff you Should Know is a production of I Heart Radio.
