Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry over there. This is Stuff you should Know about breaking news Colan Zica. Yes, We've had a bunch of people asked us to do this and over the summer basically, and uh, I finally gave in. I said, all right, now that the epidemic is starting to wayne, we'll step in and start talking about it. Well. Uh, one of the reasons I'm always reticent to do something so on the forefront is like this is this will be outdated by the time it's released in a couple of weeks. Yeah. I was looking at some of the dates on on the material we used, and like August was the most recent data I could get on some stuff. I'm like that, surely things have changed enough. Then I want the newest numbers. Give them to me. Who and they're like, let us go, And Roger Dalterry said, no, that was a bad joke all over. So anyway, I mean, we're gonna give you the overview of what we know. But Zeka is a or at least, the current outbreak is a pretty new thing and they don't know a ton about it. So there there's a lot of mystery involved and a lot is changing on a daily basis, So just take it with a grain of salt. Yes, that's not medical advice though, and some deet. Yeah. Um, so you said it's a fairly recent a fairly recent origin, UM, and a lot of people say, yeah, weird stuff suddenly appearing around the world, like, um, chicken guna which is related to zekea and zeka has to have something to do with climate change. That's definitely that's going chicken. I was about to say, that's a delicious chicken. No, you're thinking of chicken tonight. Okay, chicken gun is not delicious. It's very painful. Yes, UM, not making light of that, I was, but you know what I mean, Yeah, you're chuck UM. But it's actually it was back in I think nineteen forty seven that some researchers UM from Europe in the United States working in Uganda, UM discovered this in a Reesea's monkey named Reesa's seven six six. It was born to be an experimental lab animal because it was named that UM and they they were looking for yellow fever and they found instead this brand new virus that they've never seen before. So Reesa's seven six six became the first known carrier of zeka. Yeah, and it's named after that that forest in Uganda where they found this monkey and they didn't find it in humans until nineteen fifty two. And um, and if you're thinking and at that point it was Uganda, you're not a Tanzania where they found it in humans. And if you're thinking nineteen fifty two, guys, this is like breaking news, Well, this outbreak is breaking news. Zeka had not been previously a very big problem pre two thousand seven. It was very localized to tropical Africa. Yeah, and not a lot of cases even. Uh. In fact, even in two thousand seven there were fourteen cases documented, although they think it was probably more undocumented. And uh, it wasn't until later in two thousand seven in Micronesia that they had sort of the first large outbreak, which was forty nine cases, which isn't even that much. And then in two thousand fourteen in French Polynesia, nineteen thousand suspected cases. And then now this one is much much bigger. Yeah, something like UM. I again, I was really pressed to find hard figures, but it looks like something like a million people have been infected with ZEKA worldwide since UM two thousand fifteen is when this outbreak officially started. And it's shown up in sixty seven countries since two thousand fifteen, since the beginning of this outbreak, And yeah, I we need different numbers. I was counting too, and I came up with fifty eight. But I was like, it's got to be more than that. I saw something in the fifties. I saw sixty seven I think on the World Health Organization website, which is why I was I was like, that's probably right. But while we're we're recording this, literally another country could pop up. Yeah. Actually, Singapore is in the midst of a new outbreak right now. UM. As of September, they have three hundred and eighty three reported locally transmitted cases, right which is pretty significant. But that's up from fifty four on August twenty nine, So less than a month, it's gone from fifty four cases to eight three. I read actually a posted an article on our Facebook page yesterday about UM. I think it may have been from Slate, but the author's uh suggestion was that there's a lot of apathy in the United States towards Zeka right now. Um, And then there were a bunch of read the comments and a lot of people a valid points. They are like sort of a crying wolf situation, like Ebola didn't turn out to be mad Cow, didn't turn out to be you know, none of these things turned out to be these devastating pandemics here in the US well exactly, so, you know, the United States has a tendency to be a little US centric. Sure, so I think the comments I got from our listeners at least we're like, you know what, we've heard this before, and so maybe there is some apathy. There's a huge fear that that is going to prevent a vaccine from being developed. That's why there's not an ebola vaccine because the outbreak was contained, and every one said, wow, we don't need to fund we don't need to start funneling emergency funds towards vaccination research. It's fine, and it stayed basically in Africa, hit a couple of people in America and Europe, but for the most part, it's over there, so we don't have to worry about it, and they're worried that the same thing is going to happen. That this the end of October, mosquito season is going to decline and the outbreak is going to naturally in in step decline as well. Uh And the public will and public funding for vaccinations, emergency vaccinations against zica is going to dry up. The big problem is we're eventually going to those dire public warnings could eventually come to pass. It might not have this pastime with the bola, it might not this time with zeka, but there's there's a definite possibility that it could happen, and we're gonna be like, man, I really wish we would have stuck with it ten years ago. Oh and we had the chance to develop a ZECA vaccine. Yeah, it's um it's a really narrow line. I think that with media reporting on stuff like a ban flu and mad cow and uh two get people fired up and scared and preach fear or to you know, for people to know that there is a really good chance that this could be bad. Yeah, if it's not, then great, But then turn around and say, well, you've got scared over nothing. Like people should say, well, that's wonderful news that it was smaller than we thought. But yes, you can lay a certain amount of the blame for this at the at the feet of the media, for for drumming up fear for ratings, and we should say that's not at all our intention with this. No, we're perfectly happy with our ratings normally UM and we I think if it goes to say, there's most public health officials are not panicking about this thing UM and and zekea itself is even like a pretty um, pretty mild disease. The problem is, and the reason the World Health Organization created a Global Health Emergency UM alert, they put everybody on high alert UH and started funneling money and attention towards Zeka is because there's a cluster of microcephaly in Brazil, which is basically ground zero for this most recent UM outbreak. And they're they're saying, now, there's there hasn't been any direct evidence, but there's so much correlation between being infected with the zeke virus wild pregnant and having a baby with microcephaly afterward UM that they're like, yes, Zeca causes microcephaly. Basically is the point we're at. Yeah, well let's let's jump back a little bit. So if you get ZEKA, only of the people infected will show any symptoms at all. And these symptoms just so you're looking out for them, which is always good to do. Fever, red eyes, joint pain, bumpy rash, what else you can have muscle pain and headache. Those apparently are less common symptoms. Um, but that's that's about it. And and like you said, I think four fits of people who have ZEKA are not going to show symptoms, and the ones who do have symptoms probably they're not going to be bad enough to even go to the doctor for. Yeah, they only last a few days to a week, and um, it's it's not something that will kill you. And I think that's another reason that a lot of people have apathy is because it has such a narrow, uh focus of harm, which is specifically right now at least largely pregnant women's babies. That and then there's one other thing that it's been linked to, although not quite as conclusively, is U Barre syndrome, which is a really bizarre and mysterious disorder that comes out of nowhere where your um immune system attacks your the nerves in your body and can leave you paralyzed at worse, but even milder on the spectrum, UM can leave you laid up, bedridden, un a ventilator. Yeah. And the the idea that they don't have any idea where it comes from is very unsettling. Yeah. And right now they've made a much stronger correlation with the microcephaly than I have the G B s UM. Because I'm going to try and pronounce that again A bar A. Yeah, it sounds easy. I know that because there's a there's a stuff you should know. Listen to remember the guy who's get well card we we filled out UM and I tweeted there's like a I think a go fund me to too, like get a wheelchair access vane is laid up. His name is John Say. He lives here in Atlanta. He's a great guy. You can chip in for John if you want to UM. You can search John Say s A y E on go fund me dot com or go to go fund me dot com slash to j h X eight y K. But I should say he didn't get it from Zeka UM. But he has the bar and they have no idea where it came from. But all of a sudden one day, your immune system just turns on your nerves when you're in trouble. Amazing. Yeah. Uh, all right, so let's talk a little bit about microcephi um. It is a birth defect. H It's the characterization mainly is that your baby will have a very small head and as a result, in under developed brain or I don't know as a result, but those two things happen. Well, they think what happens is that the virus attacks stem cells in the developing brain and ends up UM preventing the brain from developing properly. And they think it's also possible it's simultaneously attacks um structural proteins in the brain, so the existing tissue that's already been developed can can be destabilized, and then the stuff that's developing, uh, doesn't have a chance to develop correctly, in which case you you have babies born with like a lot of parts of their brain missing. Right. Yeah, and um, I read this one interview on It was the MPR interview. Yeah, it was from NPR and their health correspondent Rob stein Um was talking about kind of like he went and visited Brazil and visited these babies and he said, you know, he said it was devastating and that some of the new research they published some brain scan images from a bunch of these Brazilian babies, and um, some they found some really weird things. Uh, entire portions of their nervous systems are missing just not there, like parts of the brain stem, parts of the spinal cord. And then sometimes in some cases, uh, you think the baby is okay, and then they're born and then you realize that parts of the brain are like full of fluid, so it has puffed up the brain so it looks like it's a normal size and like a scan or something, right, Yeah, but there's you know, severe brain damage going on. Right, and so this leads to things like seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, UM, problems with moving around or balance difficulties, swallowing, hearing loss, vision problems, um. And typically this is it's irreversible. What that happens. Yeah, and super sad. He uh. He talks about the cries of these babies. He said they cry more, and not only more, but he said it's a really you know, if you have a baby, you know they're different. Cries mean different things and one of the keys to figure out what's what and um, these cries, he said, are just abnormal, and that they sound like anguishing pain is going on, and they're much harder to soothe. So that's just like heartbreaking stuff, it is. And so you can understand why, uh, couples who are planning on getting pregnant, women who are pregnant um are just scared to death of this, the idea of of contracting ZEKA. Sure they found that, Uh, at first they thought that the first trimester UM was the most dangerous point, but now apparently after further study, they're like, yeah, there's really no safe point in a pregnancy UM where you could get a ZECA infection and probably be protected. Yeah. And I think they're airing on the side of caution because they're still so early in the game. They don't want to say like, nope, just the first trimester, like they're kind of saying, we don't know, it could be anytime during the pregnancy UM. And he the the NPR correspondent was he couched the whole thing and saying like he wasn't he wasn't raising public fears. I think he did it in the right way. He said, we don't know what this one's gonna look like. He said, it could just die out again and be a medium sized outbreak that goes away, he said, or it could be worse. We just gotta like be responsible and see what happens. Yeah, and they were saying, also, chuck the um. The estimates of the incidents of microcephily that come from zekea so far is between like one and which is an enormous increase in the incidents of microcepily because it's apparently a fairly uncommon um disorder and something like UM twelve babies per ten two to twelve babies per ten thousand berths in the United States, UM are born with microceptile normally between two and twelve per ten thousand births. If one percent, just one percent of women who contracts ZECA give birth to a baby with microceffily, that's like ten times is the normal rate. And that's the low end of the estimate. So again, like yeah, if you're just some dude, some bachelor who's like, you know, hanging around uh, Margarita Ville, and you get stung by a mosquito UM and you can track ZEKA and you don't even have symptoms. Who cares? Well, the idea that you that somebody else could have a baby with microceftly, that's who cares. That's just making this a public health emergency, you know. All right, Well, let's take a quick break and we'll get back and talk a little bit about how it is spread. All right, Josh, you mentioned mosquitoes. We've kind of danced around it, or maybe we already said, but we'll go ahead and say it now, yellow fever mosquitoes. Uh, the adies and gyp tie there you go, that's the little bugger responsible. Uh, they're responsible not just for yellow fever and zica but also den gae and um, chicken guna too, which is delicious. Again you're thinking of chicken tonight and only certain chicken tonight's too. Um. Did we talk We did a really good podcast. I remember our mosquitoes. It was great. But did we talk about I Now we talked a little bit, but I can't remember we landed on the idea of eradicating them outright? And are they one of those that we can get rid of? And it doesn't have some big ripple effect. We can't say that we could get rid of anything any species of anything wholesale and not have really detrimental effects. But in the mosquito one of those that people like researchers think we might well, yeah, get rid of without losing you know, it's not like losing the honeybee. There there are some serious proposals to get rid of mosquitoes as as part of treating Zeka. I just hope that's the case. I hate him. I hate him. I hate him. Oh that we get rid of them, Yeah, I think it would be great. They carry I mean, beyond the stupid nuisance that you know, I you know, my privileged self feels at my house. I'm talking about, you know, in countries where they spread serious disease. It's a real, real problem. It is a real problem, and so I guess we might as well talk about this. There's there's a couple of proposals that the World Health Organization UM, who right, are that was good though you almost got me. They're they're looking into and are planning on deploying and are actually there's some pilot projects. One of them we talked about in the Mosquito episode, which was UM releasing transgenic mosquitoes into the wild. And so these things carry a genetic artificially inserted genetic um mutation that prevents their offspring from surviving to maturity and therefore they're unable to reproduce. Right, So you release these genetically ulter mosquitoes into the wild and after several generations, the mosquito population starts to die off. Wonderful, there's one. There's a there's a test pilot by this UM, this company called ox a Tech working out of UM, England, I believe, I'm not quite sure exactly where, but they created a genetically modified mosquito back in two two and part of the project UM, part of the proving test experiment, I think that's what they call it. There's there's ellipses and everything to indicate the pauses. But UM they released some in Sal Paulo, Brazil as part of a pilot project in April last year. In January of this year, there had been an eighty two percent reduction in wild mosquito larva. Let's do it so it works. The problem is is I think that is the pinnacle of human hubris, the idea that we can just get rid of an entire species and there not be some sort of ripple effect. That we couldn't foresee that. We're gonna be like, oh, we shouldn't have done that. There's an alternative one. So, yes, you're inconvenience right when you're stung by a mosquito and it sucks. I see that was an accident. All right, there's But the bigger problem is for for people who are like suffering and dying from diseases like malaria or dana feb or something like that. Well, there's an alternative to getting rid of mosquitoes, and it's actually treating mosquitoes with something called Walbaccia, which is a bacteria that infects the gut of a mosquito and actually prevents the zecra virus from um living there. Okay, so you've still got the mosquito. Yeah, so you're not completely altering the ecosystem. I'm still inconvenience, but lives are being saved. But you're getting right, which is what really matters exactly. Yeah, So that one seems to me like a little smarter, and they're they're working on that too. They've released a bunch in Brazil and so these um uh artificially infected mosquitoes go out and um they infect other mosquitoes out in the wild, and pretty soon, all of a sudden, Zeke is like, oh man, I remember the good times and they're gone. Well, it seems like the mosquito is one that they could probably research enough to see if it would have an impact if it left us. But off the top of my head, I'm thinking, well, bats eat mosquitoes, and all of a sudden, you're taking away the food source from an animal that we love. Ham that's just off the top of your head. But then you think, like, but do they need mosquitoes or they just like, well, well they're there, I'll eat them, or would they just move on something else? But then do they decimate some other thing that might be useful? You know, I get the ripples they're going after house cats while they already do that. Yes, there's a real possibility for a ripple effect that that would have catastrophic unforeseen consequences. And also, I mean, I am totally for getting rid of mosquitoes. If we know for certain that there wouldn't be that ripple effect, I'd be on board. I go out there and start squashing them myself. Yeah, but I think what you're saying is is that there's no way to know for certain, which is you know it's valid. Yeah. So one thing about this mosquito, and I know you know a bit more than me about how it's transmitted. But looking at the this guy, this particular yellow fever mosquito, h it has white markings on the leg. And like all mosquitoes, uh, they're active in the morning, in the evening, tend to die down a bit in the heat of the day, and then at night, you know, go off and hide. Right, But how does it actually trans met beyond just sticking that needle in? So I guess some mosquito got ahold of Reese's seven six six one day or something some other carrier like that, and the mosquito itself becomes infected, although it doesn't have as far as we know, any symptoms from ZEKA. Oh. Interesting, So it's not just that it's carrying the infected blood. They're act Yeah. And and that's a big point because if a mosquito comes and sucks your blood, um, it's not transmitting any of its own blood in there. So when it sucks your blood and you have zeca, right, the mosquito puts its what thank you man? That one that in deleterious always elude me. When it puts its proboscus in your skin to suck out your blood, it also salivates in there right, which is like an anesthetizes you. And if you have zeka, that zekea goes from your blood into the mosquito's gut, where the zeka um begins to colonize the mosquito, infect the mosquito, and ultimately it makes it into its salivary glance. So when when that mosquito in searches proboscis into the next person's arm, it uses the saliva rus to say she, because it's always a female mosquito that bites you. She um uses salivaty to anesthetize your arm, and that's where the zeka gets into you. Okay, Because they have found that the virus lives in saliva, yeah, that's a big deal. But they're not you know, they're still trying to figure out like exactly all the ways it could be transmitted. Um. They found it in saliva, they know it can be transmitted through um well through sexy time. It can live in semen for seemingly longer than in blood. Yeah, so when it's in your blood. It stays there for like a week and then they're like, Okay, where's it go. Obviously it stays in the body because they did find it and some guys see mean, was it like ten weeks after he was infected with zeka um And they know that you can get it sexually and through mosquitoes, but they've also found it in saliva um, vaginal secretions. I think I think you're in in definitely breast milk, which is another fear among mothers too, the one the sexual transmission. I think the first couple of cases, one was in Texas and a man was infected after having sex with someone who came back from Venezuela that was infected. So you know a little scary right, Uh. And here's one of the rubs is in um. As far as intercourse, there was a guy named researcher named Brian Foy who published a paper this is five years ago um in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, which is a great to read at a dinner party. I tell you, just pull that out and get the conversation going. But he argued that there was evidence that you could transmit zeca sexually, uh, through intercourse and he said, we need to study this more and basically was denied and they said, you know what, this is too obscure disease to give funding. Um, which you know may have been the case, is sort of a tough thing. You can't throw money at everything, but it is frustrating when this guy was on this five years ago, and it could be a lot further along as far as learning more about the sexual transmission. You know, yep, Zeka just wasn't hot enough back then. So Chuck, people are saying, like, how how do we stop this? For love of God, think of the children. Yeah, well, the mosquito part is a big part of it, um, and we talked a little bit about eradicating mosquitoes, but you know, all the normal safe things, safe measures you can take with mosquitoes you should obviously do if you're in a place where Zeka might be uh more rampant um and listen to our mosquito podcast for that. But you know, in scropellent long sleeve shirts and pants, try to not be outside during those times a day where they're around more to all that stuff. But a vaccine is what we're really looking for. Yeah, you know, there's a there's apparently a few companies who are really trying to race a vaccine to market and get fast tracked. I think a company in India is the top contender right now. And then you found one that seems pretty legit too, So it's best I can figure. The n i H has a division called the n I A I D. Right, the National Institute for Allergic and Infectious Diseases. I think that sounds right. But they are working on a vaccine and they're using a similar approach to UM what they have been successful with with West Nile, and right now it is safe in the phase one of the clinical trials, and they're trying to push forward. And what they're doing is and UM, I don't fully understand this, so I'm just gonna kind of read this part. But they said their vaccine has a small circular piece of DNA called the plasmid that they've engineered to contain genes that code for the proteins of the virus. Then when you inject that, the cells read those genes and make those virus proteins, and then they self as symbol into the virus like particles. Then that gets that immune system kicked into gear. So you're putting in a basically an artificial version that's not that's not infectious. Yeah, that's the key, I think. Yeah, yeah, because I mean, like you, you couldn't possibly transmit that that artificial zekea virus um to anybody else, but it will still mount it will still get your body to mountain immune response, and that would mean that when you actually do come in contact with the actual zecovirus would be toast. Yeah. And this is just one of the vaccines that they're continuing in a in a trial run. But um, I think, I mean, there are several that they're, like you said, a couple in India, they're trying to get through, Like a lot of people are hard at work trying to conquer this thing via vaccinations. And again there's a real tremendous fear that um that the public will and public funding will dry up when this makes it out of the news cycle, when it's dropped from the news cycle, you know. Yeah, And speaking of funding, well, should we take a break. That's a good little tease, speaking of funding. The stage coach is about to go off the cliff. All right, we'll be right back, Okay, we're back in Chuck. We're talking about funding, yes, uh, and not only do is funding possibly going to be a problem when the zeka um outbreak goes away, which inevitably will we hope. Um, there's actually a huge problem with funding right now. The the CDC head Thomas Frieden that his name, Yeah, I think that's it. Um. He took to the airwaves and said, uh, guys, we're running out of money and we need Congress to come back in session and give us some asap for Zeka. Yeah. So the timeline on this is last year early last year. President Obama said, Congress, can we have one point nine billion uh an emergency funds for Zeka to help fight Zeka and uh Congress said no. Um. They said wait wait Obama, are you asking and said, well, yeah, I'm asking, and they said no. Yeah. The controlling Republicans said that. They said, we want more accountability for the money where it's going, and why don't you take some of the money left over from Ebola and other projects and use that instead? Or they said, or we could do this, We could take money away from Planned Parenthood if you want money for Zeka. And then the Democrats were like, well, that's not very nice and un it turned political, no surprise, but um, they CDC did in fact end up taking money from Ebola. I think, Um, how much was it? Thirty eight million dollars from Ebola funding and forty four million from emergency response funding, which is really scary because that means if something really big happened here in the US, uh, in terms of Zica, they may not literally may not have the money to send teams of people to wherever that is. Yeah, so they're nicking money from these other programs. They're saying, we really need this to be seriously funded, and right now politics is getting in the way. Yeah, which is pretty sad because again, think of the children. Yeah, and hopefully this will change and they'll get the funding they need. But right now, I mean Fred and I don't know if he's crying wolf too much to try and get the public worked up, but he's he seems to think that it's pretty dire and that they need these resources. So I'm just I'm taking the man at his word. At this point, he said that of the two and twenty million that they had allocated for ZEKA, twenty millions already out the door, and if they've already used another, um, you know, forty four million from UH emergency response funding, thirty eight million from a bola I would I would guess that, yes, there's some problems coming. Yeah. Um. The CDs, speaking of the CDC, they actually um did something as a result of the Szeka outbreak that they've never done before. They issued a travel warning advisory against traveled to a place in America. I've never done that before. It's always been somewhere else outside of the country. But um, when I think in August, the beginning of August, when there was an outbreak of zica, including a local UH transmission, which means that it wasn't up to that point, there were a couple of thousand cases of zeka in the United States, but all of them were people who went to the Caribbean, or to Africa, or to the America's or to Southeast Asia, got bit by an agudas a Gypti mosquito and then came back and they were at risk of possibly transmitting it sexually or of a mosquito biting them and spreading it. Well, that apparently finally happened because someone in Miami was bit by a mosquito and contracted ZEKA. So that means that it is it had entered the mosquito, the wild mosquito population, And that's what really started to get um. The CDC and others worried because they said, for it is tough right now. Yeah, I mean it's it's not like rampant or anything, but they're the cases are are accumulating to the point where people are getting a little worried. Yeah. And and again if you go to the Caribbean and come back with Zica, they weren't too worried about that. What was worrying them is the idea of mosquitoes getting it, because they said humans are not the vectors of transmission that we need to be worried about. It's the mosquitoes. Well, in Puerto Rico is a big problem right now. Um. In fact that the name of this article I got was Puerto Rico is ground zero. Uh it's not literally ground zero, but as far as the US is concerned, it is probably you know, they're American citizens. And at this rate, two thousand people a week are getting infected in Puerto Rico. And they said, if this holds of their entire population, by the end of the year could be infected with zica. Uh, more than pregnant women. I'm sorry, did you see? Yeah, it says a quarter of their three point five million uh population could get it by the end of this year. And you know we're in almost September. Wow, so uh more than women pregnant women have tested positive. And um, man, I feel so bad for those women. I'll bet they are losing their minds with just fear right now. As if you know, pregnancy isn't you know? Yeah? Uh. And there are a lot of problems in Puerto Rico, or a lot of challenges at least, um it reigns a lot. There are a lot of puddles, a lot of mosquitoes. Um, one of the big They're in a financial crisis and one of their main sources of income is tourism and this is not helping their tourism in any way. So uh they need funding for re and um they were gonna do some mass spraying, but the people said no, it's dangerous. There was apparently also mosquitoes have developed a lot of tolerance to that over the decades too. They found one certain insecticide that they said is working a lot better but there's a lot of resistance to it. So um, right now, the CDC says, if you're pregnant, don't go to Puerto Rico, and uh, wait at least two months before trying to get pregnant after you come home, if that's in your plans. And uh I've even seen some people say, if you go to Puerto Rico, you know, don't have sex or make sure you practice safe sex. Yeah, but none of that bodes well for their tourism industry, which is where a lot of their dope comes from. Come to Puerto Rico and don't have sex afterwards. Yeah, that's not a good slogan. It's definitely not. Um. So, I want to specify, the CDC didn't say that you should not go to Florida. They said that you should not go to this particular spot in North Miami or just north of downtown Miami. There's a neighborhood that was kind of ground zero for this outbreak. But Florida and in and of itself is suffering as far as tourism goes um or on the press pits of really suffering depending on how this outbreak goes down there um and as a result, like Walt Disney World and Universal Florida and SeaWorld all now are just kind of casually giving you a uh small aerosol can of complimentary UM mosquito spray whenever you come into the park. Yeah, they're not um and probably rightfully so they're not putting up signs that say ZEKA because that would be a pr disaster. But I think it's pretty clear what's going on, is there. Yeah, like, here's your ticket, and here's your stub, and here's your deep deep Mickey Mouse brand deep. You know. So, Chuck, how do you diagnoses zeka if you are worried about it? Well, one of them, like a lot of these uh diseases that you might catch abroad. One of the first things they do is say where have you been lately? Have you traveled? And where? They Yeah, if you say, well, I was in Brazil and yeah, that's another thing too. Let's have the Olympics so the whole world comes together at ground zero for the current ZEKA outbreak. That was a big worry, But apparently no one associated with the Olympics has tested positive for ZEKA. It's been over for a couple of weeks now, that's good. Sorry, for interrupting. I don't know. I was actually I was wondering about that because I knew it was a big fear of going in. UM. Yeah, so they're gonna say where have you been traveling? Ask what kind of symptoms, and we already went over those, and then they're gonna just basically give you blood and urine tests and that'll let them know pretty quick what's going on. Yeah. I think they can actually detect the virus itself in your blood, but again, it leaves the blood after a week and starts going other places. And once that's um the case, I think they can do saliva tests and detect antibodies in your saliva and urine. They should just do all those tests, like don't even ask me where I've been, Just take some blood and or maybe ask where I been because that doesn't take long. Yeah, but do it as you're drawing my blood. Well these days, I mean, I mean, it doesn't really matter where you've been. Increasingly, yeah, because it's starting to creep up and chuck. Actually, we have to say this is really important before you um take anything. If you think you have ZEKA, you have to be diagnosed with ZEKA before you can take end sets like advil or a leave or a motor in something like that, because it's possible you actually have dn gay fever, in which case because the symptoms are very similar. And if you do have dan gay and you cannot take end seats because dan gay um blocks the action of platelets which are clot that help with clotting, right, and so to do end said, so you put end seats and dena together and you can hemorrhage pretty easily. Yeah, that's not good. Now, if you're worried about this, then you're in uh, Michigan. You probably don't need to unless you get it through sexual transmission or Canada totally out of the question again, except through sexual transmission, because this is very much out of the range of the Agudas and jyptime Mosquito UM. It's just parts of the South, the American South, Southeast UM a little bit, it creeps up a little bit into the Midwest UM, and then all basically of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, UM. California, Yeah, parts of California. There's a really helpful map if you're just panicking right now on the World Health Organization website that don't panic. Yeah, I don't panic. There's no cause to panic now, Uh, please don't panic. No, I think the best practice is to educate yourself by listening to this and um, then spreading fear to everyone, you know, just kidding, great advice. That was a top, top notch way to end this way. Yeah, be very uh column and everything and just spread fear right play queens, just did uh you got anything else? No? Um? How much of this is out of date already? Do you think? Probably that's not too bad. I can live with that. Yeah, we get wrong anyway. If you want to know more about Zica, well to surf the web man. There's plenty out there. And since I said surf the web, it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this Bacon buddy. Remember we were talking about bacon buddy. Yeah, the b U T T Y, which I didn't know what it was us. I didn't either, but now we do because they're good friends in the United Kingdom have written us. Yeah. I wish somebody would have brought this up before we went, because I would have been on the lookout for them. Bees. Well, well, I'll get to it. Hey, guys, can't believe you have never heard of the amazing bacon buddy. Just that name sounds great, a little bacon buddy, even though it'spelled differently, especially if you've recently been to England, home of the buddy. The word buddy is a UK British shorthand for buttered sandwich or roll like uh like you know, remember when I was saying chippy for fish and chips, except cute ways of shortening things. So a bacon buddy is essentially a bacon sandwich or roll with a on a roll with a lovely helping of butter, or if you're mean, you love it with HP sauce. Yeah, that could be good too. They love their HP sauce HP. Is that what you're saying? Another cracking buddy you might have heard of in the past are chip buddies, as you call French fries. So the next time you're in the UK, pop into any fish and chip shop ask for a chip buddy. You get a crusty roll loaded with chips, covered in vinegar and salt. So bad for you, but so tasty. On a slightly separate note, Chuck's hearing Chuck's love for mayonnaise makes me so happy because I am also slightly addicted to the stuff. When I was younger, I would eat what I called it cheesy dunkers. I love this, dude. This was essentially cheddar cheese cut into long, thick strips which I would then dunk into my pot of helmets mayonnaise man, cheesy dunk a mall uh. Great show as usual, guys, keep doing what you're doing. That is from Kyle Chandler from Kent, England, but right now in South Korea. And two things I would add, I was totally wrong about baoli. It is garlic based by definitions. I didn't stand up for myself. You were fine and dum too. I've had a bacon, buddy, I didn't know it. No, I was in the sky lounge at at Uh. Stop probbing that in my face. The sky lounge membership you have, it can be yours, but I want it for free. Well here's the thing, dude. You eat and drink well over four fifty dollars in a year worth of free stuff in these sky lounges. Oh yeah I could. I could probably do that and then visit I was at one the other day. I just went to Cleveland, had two bloody Mary's and a buffet meal for free. It's like thirty five dollars in an airport. Yeah, I'm telling you, I'm keeping tally like I'm gonna make my money back on you have a little ledger. I do you put on your little Bankers visor with the Greenville one bacon buddy one whiskey? How was the bacon buddy? Well, it's delicious and um someone else rode in. The bacon that they have over there is different than what we have over here. Yeah, it looked like because I fat back or something. Yeah, they call it streaky bacon, this big wide hammy chunks man, and I got it. Wasn't called a bacon buddy on the menu. Was just called bacon on a roll because nobody would know what you're talking about. What they call it bacon buddy. Yeah, and uh so I did had a bacon buddy, and I loaded it with butter and it was see in America we have that with egg and cheese all wrapped up. But just the bacon is enough for them. Sure, and it was delicious. Yeah, we call it the enormous sandwich burger king. I haven't had that one, Oh you haven't. It's basically everything you could possibly eat for breakfast on like a HOGI roll us say yeah yeah uh.
