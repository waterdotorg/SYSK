Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant, There's guest producer Matt Yeah, and Jerry's not here because Jerry is a storm sufferer. Yeah. How did you fare? Pretty good? I mean powers out for a little while, cables out for a little bit, nothing, nothing bad. Yeah, we um, we're talking about Irma. If this is this is obviously in the future, there maybe another hurricane by then for all we know. Yeah, well, Jose is starting to circle background. I think, yeah, that's what I see. Uh. But yeah, Irma came through Atlanta, which is weird for a hurricane and then eventually tropical storm to reach that far inland. Uh. And I was kind of like, well, you know, we get bad thunderstorms in Atlanta, will be fine. Didn't make you. I bought some extra milk for the kid, and but I didn't like go nuts with you know, prepper style stuff. But it was surprisingly scary. I'm here to tell you. Were you scared? Yeah, I mean that was like in our our part of Atlanta got hit the hardest. Um, sort of the Eastlake Decatur, Kirkwood, decap County area. Uh, And there was one there was one moment where the trees and we have all these old you know, Atlanta for those of you who don't know, as a city built in the middle of a forest. So there are these old oak and pine trees that apparently have shallow roots from past droughts and things, because the roots kind of come towards the surface. Just not good. Yeah, And I was kind of wondering, you know, us like we like to just sort of study things in general, and I was looking at these trees swaying, and I was wondering about the physics of an uprooted tree. And then it's probably like you know, and the roots give and every time it swings, it probably just gets a little more unstable. And then the big gust and then so we had before like five huge trees down within a thousand feet of our house. So we were just sort of waiting. I was just literally like, all right, which one is coming to hit us? And there was one huge gust that came through at one point where it was so scary sounding that we grabbed the animals and our daughter and like ran into the hallway and Emily stayed there with her and the animals. You know, I could not. I was pacing from window to window the entire time. What's going on? It was like, if I can see it coming down, I might give us a half a second to get out of the way. But I did see one come down behind my house in real time, which was scary. I'll bet that must have been kind of amazing to see though, too. Yeah, and the sound like obviously we we got nothing like uh Florida, so I'm not trying to compare, but um, it was a little scary. And we didn't have power for three days, which is not fun. So I've never seen a tree fall down in real time, so subtle a bet? Okay, does it make a Wilhelm scream? He started to follow the wine. We can get Jerry to dovin Wheah the wrong one. Uh So anyway, it was I mean, it was fun at first not being not having power, uh And then also wanted to announce because people care so much about our pets because they're part of the show. On Monday or Tuesday, it was Tuesday, we took the Wizard in because he had been like hiding and whenever animals start doing weird things like that. You know, it's not good. Uh, and you know, like the rest of the other three over the past nine months, tumors all over his body. So we put him down yesterday with no power, but had one really great night the night before with like we were forced to just be quiet and there were candles lit because it ended up being this like peaceful candlelight vigil because the power outage kind of forced that upon us. Works out like that sometimes. Yeah, I was going, you know, if that happened, we might have just been watching TV with him and you know, still petting him and caring for him. But he's just like game quick Game of Thrones. Well, I'm sorry, Chuckers, did I quick Game of Thrones from everybody? I'm sorry. I appreciate that. Man, it was Emily. I mean I was wrecked, but Emily is destroyed. Is this cat like was attached to her body? Fifteen years? Is that how long? How old he was? Yeah? And you know, we got great lives atle lurn buckleyan wizards, so they were good, longful lives. But when you get together with a human and you get four animals in the space of a year or so, it's all good times and you don't think about the end of that. Yeah you know. Oh, well like the secession of deaths in quick order that can happen. Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. You know. Yeah, now they're all here. Now they're all gone. Yeah, like I thought maybe like we'd lose one a year or every couple of years, but it's like, no, November, February, September. Yeah, that's that is quick secession. It's not fun. Yeah. So anyway, I just want to get that out of the way. Hang in there, man, and hats off to you for coming in. Yeah, than just being like nope, well we don't. We don't pad the queue like we used to know, which is good. It keeps it fresh, but there's also less room to just be like nope, yeah, we can bring breaking news one crayons, right exactly. I was gonna say during IRMA, did you guys with your power out scribble anything with crayons? Uh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean eventually we sent, uh sent my daughter over to my grandparents just as parents her grandparents. Yeah, and it's just she was getting a little kg, and quite honestly, I think we were getting a little kg. But at first. Yeah, it was that was greyon play yeah, play the big fat kind. Yeah, she has the big big daddies right now, because I mean she's got a little hand, so that's what she uses. That's the only kind she con grita better to scribble with. Right, her fine motor neurons are not quite refined enough to hold the normal traditional size crons. Well, I mean she would hold it, but she would hold it like she holds a long sword. Right, Yeah, yeah, I know, I know what you mean, the deathly purpose right. So um, it turns out, Chuck, I don't know how much of this, you know, having a young one with crayons. I don't know if like you read the back of the box and they're like, okay, that's the history of crayons. Huh, how was it on the back of the box. Maybe I don't even know. I haven't seen a cran in years. But I have a question for you. Is it normal to weep quietly while you're research and crayons? Didn't you have a nostalgia vers Yes? Yeah, I mean just like the idea of that that box with like the logo and the smell of them. We're talking about Crayola crayons. I might as well just go ahead and get that out of the way. And it's really funny because this this how stuff works article went to great links to just be about how crayons work. A nice effort. Yeah, but they you know still, I mean, it's Crayola that you're talking about in the United States when you're talking about crayons for the most part. Yeah, and so much so that, Um, the author didn't even really talk about Crayola as a company much, right, And I thought that was wrong. I thought so too, So we're going to correct that in the podcast. Um. But I've found out from this research that there is hydros Oreo situation going on in the cran world. Prang, which is at best and also ran in the Kran competition. It was actually around before Crayola or making Crans. Remember Praying I think they're still around Praying Ones. No, No, I think they were just an off brand, but they were. It's like Hi Drocks. Everybody thinks Hi Drocks is a knockoff. No Oreos, the knockoff but better, but the superior cook exactly same with Crayola, crayons and pranks, Like, what did we do why did you pick us? I'm sorry praying this is just the reality of the situation that I'm pointing out here. Yeah, I think so. Um. I learned a lot about this, but more than anything, I was just taken back to my childhood because childhood in Crayola go hand in hand. Yeah, Plato Crayola crayons, and we need to want Elmer's glue at some point. Sure, just knock off the Big three or paste. I had the purple kind with a pirate on it. Do you remember that one? It was highly edible, toxic. It made you know it wasn't toxic, I mean as far as I know, but the it made you want to eat it, Like you wake up and be like, I think I'm gonna eat a little that paste today at school? Yeah? Why not? It's funny you mentioned nostalgia though, because I did, you probably did too. Went to the Crayola Effects and Figures page uh, And there was a Yale study that found Yale University that is um. They found that the smell of the crayon, the Crayola crayon Yes, specifically, is ranked number eighteen on the most recognizable sense for adults, just ahead of coffee. And peanut butter. Yeah, Like that's how And I would bet your play outs up there too. Isn't it crazy though that somebody's like, oh I I would have never guessed that was coffee, but they got they got yeah, weirdos, Yeah, peanut butter, what is that? It was like weird concoction? Yeah? Is that a turd? That word is just borderline acceptable to me. I think it's one of the great gross words because the way it's spelled, more than anything, the way you spit out the words t U r D is just looks gross, but you almost you make the sound that that you make when you're when you encounter the smell of poop in a bathroom or something like third right, I think that's one of the reasons why I don't like it. It's just too visceral. Oh man, all right, so let's get into this. Okay, So crayons have not been around very long, Chuck. The crayon as we know it as in the little round childhood writing implement has only been around since the latter half of the nineteenth century. But this article goes through great pains to talk about a bunch of things that are not crayons. But waxy forms of art, so we might as well talk about a little bit of that. Like, did you find out how to pronounce this bot or batique? Well? I said bautique because I did this. Believe it or not. Oh, you've done batique before? Nice? It was weirdly, well, not weirdly, I guess my My elementary school, of which my father was principal, as we know, had a a lot of interesting programs. I can't remember the name of the class, but it was like it was sort of like an elective, but for elementary school. It was the eighties, so it was probably called that, but it was just different kind of you know. We did photography and all sorts of cool stuff that usually don't get to do in great school. But we did a bautique course and my dad got really into it for a while, So we were boutiquing in our family for a short time. Was this like right before he got into bedazzlingk uh, he never got into that. He was into photography and batiquing. So we would batique like the only thing that I remember was doing. You're gonna think this is good. We did herschel Walker Georgia Bulldog bautique canvases nice that we framed. Yeah, so let me figure this out. Unpacked that one there was like a h an image of herschel Walker on a canvas. Yeah, Walker, it would look nothing like herschel Walker. So how did you How was it a herschel Walker camp? I think, if I remember correctly, like we would get an artist to do it, and then we would batite on like a cloth canvas and then we would batique that so you would take wax and trace it over it or something like that. Yeah, I don't think it may not have been true in the batique style. For we're dancing around this a lot and people are like, what the heck is batique? It is a is a method of dying cloth where you create these patterns. You spread this hot wax over a cloth and then and then he died and then the the pigment doesn't get where the dot where the waxes, and then later you remove the wax. Right, But I don't we may have done just some weird, uh Southern version of that, because I remember like waxing already inked things and then you would crumple them up and wrinkle them and then it would give this cool like you know, like when you would wrinkle waxy fabric, that might look like shabby chiking. Maybe I don't know, man, So batique strikes me as kind of like tyde. It was well, I mean, the end effect could look sort of like tyed. It didn't have to that, but it didn't have to. But the point was, and the whole reason it's making an appearance here is that it's not like wax in a pigment. Right, So, at least two thousand, possibly even as far back as four thousand years ago, there were people who had put together that you could do cool things with wax and pigments. Yes, right, but fatique has is really not cry on in any way. No, it's not. It's a process, right, but it's the it's the seed, the kernel of the beginning of the idea of a crayon. Yeah. I think the antacoustic art is much closer. Okay, well, like a caustic art is um acoustic acoustic? Yeah, it's basically where you take a deconstructed crayon and rub it on something that's that's acaustic art. Basically, it's taking pigment and then some sort of waxy substance. UM and melting it together and then just yeah, using it to decorate. Maybe it's like a finger paint or something like that, and then I guess the wax hardens and you've got art. Yeah. I mean some of the stuff looks really cool. Did you look at any any acoustic art? Really beautiful stuff? Really so, like, what kind of art would you make with this? Well, I mean any kind Like if you if you just looked at it on a picture on your phone, you would just think it looks like a regular painting. Oh? Really? Is there like a three dimensional quality to it though? Because it's why maybe that's what I would guess, Like it's one of those things where you get up close to it and you go, oh, I see, because I'm always doing a museums, right, I know, I've been to a museum. Oh all those doses that it just man if a nickel for everyone. Uh. And then of course very famous artists like Da Vinci and Edward Munch and basically it sounds like kind of all of them we're making their own crayons in the truest sense of the word crayon, which is a French for pencil from cray which means chalk. Right c r a I E. Right, yes, and that's from the Latin creta, which meant chalk. Right, So this was not chalk, No, it wasn't, but chalk is kind of similar. And in fact, the earliest manufactured cryan, the conte crane um, basically grew out of chalk. Chalk is pigment and chalk. Yeah, I guess that's it. Uh And um artists would use chalks like you can use still today. Some some people create art using chalks, right, um, right, past cells, That's what I was looking for. So you've got past cells. It's not a really difficult hop skip and jump to say, well, how about instead of chalk we use wax and see what happens. And that's where the content cran came from. But the problem is is UM I believe it was made from beeswax, as most crans were up to the early nineteenth century. UM, and you I think had to warm it before you used it. So you probably had to take a flame to it for a little while, melted a little bit, at least get it a little malleable before you could use it. And the earliest content crans were black, brown, and red. Get a load of the beauty of those three together. If you looked up is it contra Conte? I'm saying Conte, I'm splitting the difference between the two. By the way, have you seen the response from the psychopathy who says it like that? Nut jobs say it like that. Apparently that's your psychopathy? Is just wrong, wrong, wrong? Yeah, it's apparently a real pet peeve with some people. You really need to calm down. And it's psychopathy. I don't say it like that. I never will. Yeah, psychopathy, psychopaths. It's like that guy's a real psychopath. People would just edge away from you. Uh, psychopathy. Wait and spoiler alert, where I'm gonna read an email from a legit psychopath. Yeah, we got a few emails from psychopaths. Sorry, Kapas. But if you look up the Conte crayon and a photo of it, you would see that and go, oh, I've seen those in art stores. Uh. As soon as I saw it, I was like, oh, I know what those are. It's it's kind of like for adults, adult artists who want to do crayon art. But that's where crayons came from. Yeah, I was legit art, right, And like you said, a lot of the earlier artists, pre pre mid nineteenth century artists made their own and then the first manufacturers of crans were making them for artists. Correct, So we'll we'll we'll get back into the history of crans after we take a break. How about that. Let's do it, okay, Okay. So when we left off, the manufacturer of krans was about to begin and it was all for artists. I'm in the corner batiquing herschel Walker. I don't even know what you were doing. Well, I don't think it was batiquing, though it was definitely batiquing. I bet you my dad still have some of this stuff in this basement. Well, can you bring one to work for Show and Tell? Maybe I will. Okay, I'm gonna hold you to that. I'm gonna bring it up every episode. Uh So, where do we leave off? The modern crayon is in its infancy. So the kant cran the content cran um is invented and I think that was the late eighteenth century and then by the eighteen twenties. So apparently it's lost to history who actually created the first cryan that we would recognize as a krean today. Yeah, which surprises me. But this article points out um a manufacturer named Joseph Lemercier who by the eighteen twenties was producing wax crans. Right again, though these things are um, bees wax is not easy to work with. It was way easier to go to the store and buy them, but once you bought them, it was still kind of a pain to use. Yeah, and there was I thought this was funny too. There was another company in Germany about fifteen years later, J S. Statla, that had the same crayons, but they were all encased in wood, which just seemed like a very German thing to do, right, you know. I don't know why, but I don't know. It just struck me as very German. Yeah, I can see that, you know, they don't they wanted to be clean and they don't want to get their hands dirty or anything. Uh So, like you said, beeswax no good. Um, I was doing the job, I guess. But this is before kids were using this stuff at all. I think. Yeah, again, they're making them for artists, but even artists are like this is this is not easy to use. If there's one thing that can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution, that depends on the Industrial Revolution. It is the cran tons of other stuff forward, economic progress, all that wealth capital, all of that depended on the Industrial Revolution. But so too did the krayon like to a surprising degree. And it starts with um coal mining, right. What. Yeah, in Eastern Europe they were mining coal and they found from the coal mining in um, the process of mining coal, there was a byproduct called saracen. I'm a big fan of byproduct. Use pretty neat, you know. Yeah, sarason was softer than bees wax, which was a big, big plus cheaper than bees wax, which is always good if you're in the money making business. And so there was a check company Offenheim and Ziffa who started making crayons out of that stuff. And as our article puts it, it was soon praised for its durability of the marks that it made. Right. So it was the good stuff, right. It was easy to use and it left a good mark behind, which are two things you want in a krayon, especially if you're an artist, right, You don't want disappearing ink. So somebody said, oh, what else can we get from coal? In a few years down the line, h right around the Civil War. A little after the Civil War a guy named Charles A. Bowley Boli, let's say Bowli. He was a manufacturer from Massachusetts who started using something called paraffin. Everybody's heart of paraffin wax, right. Have you ever seen a package of paraffin wax that you get at the at the grocery store? Um? Sure I have. Have you ever noticed that most of the paraffin wax is Golf brand, the same Gulf that owns the Gulf seventies six gas stations? Have not because it's a byproduct, Yes, And I never knew that until today. I'm like, why would Gulf be into gas stations and wax that you buy at the grocery store. It never made any sense to me. Now I understand because it's a it's a byproduct of fossil fuel mining. Yeah. Like why does Yamaha make keyboards and motorcycles? That's a great question. I don't know that there's an answer to that one, like diversification. Maybe that's I would like to be in on that meeting. Like, you know, we're really good at motorcycles. So I'm thinking keyboards, thinking key tars. Uh? Yeah, So I need to look at parafitt in the store. Where is it usually like in the baked goods or yeah, like wherever you'll find like Mason jars that kind of thing. Oh so like an old country store. No, they have it at the grocery store. You just always walk past it unless you're looking for it, gotcha. Yeah, all right, we'll check it out. And it's golf usually. Yeah, that's been my experience. It's always golf. I better walk past it a million times. But all right, we I'm gonna keep a lookout next time of them in the the grocery store. No, the the bell Jar aisle. I think that's probably the baking good aisle. Okay, yeah, bell Jar is that right? Huh. I'm getting on my I'm just I'm not on my game today, so I appreciate it, all right, man. Uh So that was also derived from Cole But I guess now petroleum is that I don't know. I just as far as I know, it's a fossil fuel byproduct, gotcha. If you don't want to get into the ins and outs of the Gulf Corporation. Uh So that was that was when Bolli struck gold and everyone. Yeah, everyone was like this is the stuff. This is even better than saracen um. And he said, all right, I take these and make them into pencils. Right. He was the first one to make round crayons that we we would recognize now as crayon. He was, he was the guy. And this is around the Civil War in the United States. Yeah, so coupled this with uh, post Civil war industrialization like you were talking about, and then couple this with ah, this thing that was happening in the country, which is, well, hey, maybe we should start instead of sending kids out in the fields when they're six, maybe we should start educating them a little earlier in life. And kindergarten was born again though from industrialization because not only out the fields as much. I guess they didn't um and they like they needed to be prepared for a life outside of the fields, which school would prepare them for pre factory work. Right. I actually saw a really interesting article once that basically said, like schooling is at the very least initially was meant to prepare you for long periods of monotonous work, basically busy work, that you were being prepared for life in the factory by being in inculcated, having the inculcated in you like that, that level of patients and every day and going to a place right and then just like doing the same thing. Yeah, it's kind of a droney kind of saying that schooling was preparing you for a factory working interesting, But they made school too fun. They did eventually, because I was one of those kids who kind of like school for the most of all. If your dad was leading boutique classes exactly, I can see how you would. Dude, we were repelling off of mountains in my elementary school. Yeah, that's not how they initially viewed it. They No, you probably don't do that today either. No. Now, I think you hit it at just the point where school had gotten more fun than originally planned, but much more dangerous than is allowed today. Oh yeah, all those like that, that parental slip or the permission slip, I don't think that holds water legally anymore. Probably. I think that's one step of like fifteen to be able to go on the field. Yeah, it was, and it was like like literally, your child will be going down a mountain via rope, as taught by your principle, And it was on a piece of paper. It was like cut into third, wasn't even an eight by ten piece of paper right in half by eleven And there's an asterisk that said principle does not know what he's doing. But what I was saying ultimately was that. So that was industrialization. So coal mining industrialization led to the paraffin wax right. Um, industrialization getting kids prepared for factory work led to school, and in school they wanted crayons, so that led to the creation of crans, and then industrialization itself. Mass producing crayons led to the rise of crayons, and specifically Crayola crayons. Yeah. And why did they love him in school? Um? Because they didn't make a big mess. Um. It's not like paint that you know. If you ever been a kids class of paint, you know what happens there. Man. Remember wearing like your dad's shirt backwards is like a smock. Yeah. Um, it's just no must, no fuss. It's a very um, very tight, handy, little clean product for a kid it is to use. Um. The problem was, like you said, a lot of these things were toxic at the time. So there was a company called Binny and Smith and Binny and Smith. You would love them, chuck, if you like reusing stuff. They were cousins, right, I believe were they? Um, But they were big time into like finding by products of stuff and finding new uses for it. Right, Benny, what are you gonna do with that? You're gonna You're gonna eat that sandwich. You're gonna eat the rest of that. Um. So they had a patent on an iron oxide red that most farmers used in their barns. That's how they really started to make their money. They came up with a true black, a carbon black that was used again as a byproduct of some something or other. UM. But they already had crans in use. They used them to mark their own shipments in their factories, in their warehouses. Yeah. But Mr Binny's wife, Alice was a teacher, and she said, hey, you guys should start manufacturing these. Um. They're already in the pigment business, so it made sense. So they took the paraffin wax that Boldy had come up with for using, they took their pigments that they already had UM and then they said, we need to figure out how to make this non toxic. Tinkered around with that a little bit and the Crayola crane was born I think in the eighteen eighties. Yeah, and they believe are still mostly made in the US. Uh and I think are still But even they were, they were bought out in the mid eighties by Hallmark um during you know, the big Hallmark takeover of the mid eighties when they just started buying everything. Sure, you're like, DuPont, we own you now, ABC. Uh. Forks Township, Pennsylvania, if I'm not mistaken, is where Creole was still is after all these years there I saw Easton Maybe that's where they started out. I think it's Forks Township, now, Okay, well we will hear from the good people of Pennsylvania, you will, I'm sure. But they eventually Benny and Smith Company became Crayola, right, Yeah, they finally just said enough of the screwing around. It's not Benny and Smith presents Crayola. Crayole is the whole thing, yeah, which obviously came from the word crayon and then only agenic only agenic really, yeah, what does that mean? Really? You know? And it was Mrs Binney that came up with the name too, But the fact that she was a teacher helped a lot because Binny at least was predisposed to listening to teachers, and at the time, teachers were starting to get um a little more cloud their role in society was developing and strengthening, and that by the nineteen twenties, every state in the Union had a requirement that a kid between the ages of eight and fourteen had to go to school. Um, so there was like a ready made um uh relationship. No, what's no demand in schooling? And apparently one of the first customers of Crayola was the U. S Government, who bought them for the Native American schools that they forced kids into. Is that, Hey, we took you from your family and we're just drawing your culture while you're here. But have you seen these are awesome? Huh? Shall we take another break? Yes? All right, well let's do so when we'll come back and talk a little bit how Crayola crayons are made and believe it or not, a little bit about controversy with crayons. Okay, so industrialization gives us Crayola. Crayola takes the stick and runs with it, right, And who was the other company praying pranks? Just doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, doesn't it a corner? Like? Did you ever noticed you ever see a box of crayons that weren't Crayola, Like there's something wrong with them, you know what I mean? It doesn't look right. It's definitely one of those brands that was so iconic and synonymous with its own product that, ah, you felt like, you know, you felt bad for the kids who didn't have the Crayola crayon. Yeah, I hope I'm not coming off as elitist. Sure, I had a fancy six dollar Bucks, I had knockoff crans myself, but I was also quite familiar with Crayola, and I always just love the Creola ones. The knockoff crants never evoked any emotional response to me. Somehow, Crayola did. I'm looking at a praying now and I definitely have never even seen these. Um, maybe maybe I was the only kid with the praying crayon. Well, and I know the good people at praying right now, we're screaming, we're not knockoffs. We pointed that out earlier. Yeah, we already said that earlier. You should listen to the whole episode. Um, remember the the giant box that had the sharpener in the back. So let me give you a little bit about that. Are you just bringing it up or what are you gonna saying? Oh no, I was just it just sort of occurred to me that how many crayons were This started off with sixty introduced in nine. It was the first box, I believe with the flip top box what they call the stadium seating and the built in sharpener, yeah, in the back. And it debuted on Captain Kangaroo on his showy as a commercial. I'm sure he blurred the lines there anything you're gonna love this? Yeah, and he had blods of cash coming out of his pocket, out of his green jeans exactly. Oh no, it was a different dude, that was Mr Green jan Yeah. I think he wore his pants once in a while just to show him whose boss. Uh. Yeah. I used to love those because one of my big peeves still as an adult, is a dull crayon. Yeah. So that sharpener that was I would waste a lot of wax trying to get the thing sharp. It was a huge innovation for sure. Yeah. And then of course the saddest crayon is the the broken in half one that is worn down, so uh, it's not even a round mound at this point. It's worn down to the paper and you gotta start peeling the paper away and then I don't know. I was always just like I don't want to play with this anymore. Or what about the communist who would like use the use it sideways rather than at its point? They would just rub it lengthwise so that they would flatten out on one side. They were probably artists, I guess, trying to you know, create shading patterns or something. Well, it was lost on me at the time. Yeah, Yeah, I didn't realized that I yelled at a lot of kids unnecessarily apparently. Yeah, I used crayons from my very uh now famous village people portrait. What else you gonna use for that? I don't know, maybe color pencils, but that's if you're just trying to impress somebody. Yeah, I never got into those. They're hard to I mean, like they just didn't show up quite as well crayons, says I'm here. Yeah, And it would you press down hard, and when you pull it off, the page sometimes stick a little bit, and it would make that little sound when you pulled it off. Forgot about that. Sound man John Hodgman is having a very hard time if he's listening to this nostalgia asan episodes back, not just from this episode either. You don't think he listens anywhere? Probably not. I know a bunch of podcasters now, and they none of them will they stop listening once they get to know somebody. For the most part, I don't do that. I enjoy hearing my Friends podcast. I think that makes me an outlier, though, because I've heard several marks like, yeah, I can't listen anymore that now that we're friends. Well, I wonder if it's kind of like, um, you know, if you like somebody in real life, you very frequently can't be friends with them on Facebook because it's just like a different, what hate herbal side of them. I thought that's how Facebook work in in ideal situations, But you've never had somebody where just like I can't listen to you rant about this for another minute friends on Facebook anymore because I like you in real life and I want to keep liking you in real life. But I'm gonna hate your guts if we remain Facebook friends, or if I keep following you on Twitter, because I can't stand you on social media in real life. I really like it. I know what you mean totally. It's probably the same thing. I gotta dude like that. And it's not even like political stuff. It's just I don't know, sort a jerky complaining where I'm like, that's who you are, Like I thought you were a really nice guy, right, But that's what I'm saying. It's like it brings out the worst. Social media brings up the worst in people. Yeah, the worst worst. All right, So where were we? We were talking about crayons, right, So we hadn't really started yet talking about the colors. I feel like we should because there's one thing, this is what Crayola did better than anybody else. So early on they've identified a um another company, arrival company called mons Ol. Mons Al made really high end crayons for artists, and Kreola said, you're making better crayons than we are. We're gonna buy you. We're gonna buy your cran division. So they adopted the techniques and the pigments that mons Al made but months old. Since they were gearing themselves towards artists. Their packages would say like five intermediate huge medium chrome medium, value artists cryans, and so instead of having the keeping the months old words, which would be like medium, uh medium reddish blue or something like that, they would change the name to plump. And then they would use other great names like periwinkle, dandelion. Nowadays it's things like macaroni and cheese or razmataz rasberry. Okay, but there's there's They used names that kids can get in, true and that not only can get into, like those words swirling around, swirling around in your in your consciousness, shape your worldview, like the world was kind of beautiful and there was beautiful words and things involved in it. But yeah, that was not one of them, but but the the and as a matter of fact, some of their early crayons were called things like venetia and read or cobalt blue, stuff you would find in an artist paint box. Um. And they they they figured out very early on that the name of the color means as much as the color itself. Yeah, And I think the first editions in nineteen o three they used some of them like uh, copper and gold and when they're one other one silver yeah, silver, of course, uh. And they didn't use any other metallics to the nineteen eighties. Uh, I guess, I guess said it covered there. But I think you're right. The naming, I mean, that's also gotten them into a little bit of trouble. We talked about a little controversy. Um, and you know you didn't think about this when you're a little kid in the seventies and eighties, Well, not as a little white kid. No, you're a more we're more uh for thinking society now. So when say that again, we're more poor thinking society. So when you see a crayon, um that's called flesh and it's clearly you know, uh, white white person, peachy sort of complexion of a crayon, that's not cool because they are all different colors of people. And Crayola got it right. I don't know if it was from intense pressure or internally or what, but in the when was that nineteen sixty two, they said, yeah, we probably shouldn't call this color flesh. Apparently they this was teachers again, this is listening to teachers and teachers saying like, you know, I don't think this is okay. There's apparently a study that found that kids typically used that to color and drawings of people as like a default skin color. So Crayola very wisely, I think, and and magnanimously said sorry about that. We're going to change it to peach like you said. Uh. And then they also said, you know, on their part, they said, you know, what we were talking about was the what they called them more or less universal color found on the palm of hands. But I don't know if I buy that. Yeah, I that was apparently the company line, And I'm not sure if I buy that that's even true from this article. What about this one just seems so patently racist that I can't believe it was ever a name until you look into it a little further. Indian red, yes, which was apparently derived from a plant pigment in India, And they didn't mean it like that, but then they thought, hey, maybe that's an association people are going to make. Probably not a good idea again, apparently teachers saying like, what are you guys doing? That's like as bad as having your team's baseball mascot chief nacka homer or something like that. Yeah her chief Wahoo. Yeah. Um. They change Indian read to chestnut, and uh, chestnut, it's very nice. It's a great name. No Bert Siana apparently. Also they've only dropped one other name, although they have like something like three what are called true colors, but then something like eight hundred names, so they've clearly used different names for the same color before, like magenta was renamed a red, violet was renamed magenta. I believe. Um, so they'll they'll do that old switchero here there. But apparently there are only three names they just completely got rid of. Or no, maybe there's a fourth one they retired of the they were retired the color dandelion, but just this year. Yeah, but Indian, red, um flesh, and Prussian blue were all names that were taken out and never brought back. And Prussian blue not for any reason other than kids couldn't identify with Prussia because no one knows what Prussia is anymore. I think you might have said three, there's three? Oh, is there right? I saw an article, Uh, it was like a college newspaper on their website. They said that they've crayoles sold more than a hundred thousand crayons. I can think you're missing three years three or more zeros there unless it was like today, you know, that's pretty funny. Did yeah, it got me. Um they now, you know, like any company, Um, I can't just leave it with the good old fashioned crayon. He's gonna diversify. So you see things these days like Neon colors, and and of course they make markers and all kinds of good stuff. I love the Crayola markers. Yeah, me too, the big fat marker, just the shape, the white with the color against it and everything. It was well and a lot of those now for kids are washable, so um, when the kid draws on the coffee table, it just wipes right off, very very nice. And the brand new white couch, which why did you even get that when you have a kid, what are you thinking? Oh, we would never have that because of wine consumption. It would be a purple couch. After a couple of years it would be magenta. I've got some crayle effects, were you well? First? Okay, now you go ahead, Now you go ahead. The largest one. Of course, any iconic brand like this is going to make a super giant one put on display somewhere. They did that, huh yeah, big blue, and it's kind of neat the way they did it though. They took a hundred and twenty three thousand old blue crayons that they gathered from kids all over the country and they melted those down into big blue, giant pound crayon. That's a great fate for some used up crayons, you know. Yeah, make three billion a year, not a hundred thousand. I don't know what that guy was thinking. I don't either. And maybe they met a minute or they left off. There was something missing from that sentence. I think. Uh, and the average kid supposedly, and I'm sure they're talking about dumb old American kids, by the time they're ten years old, they have gone through seven DWY crayons brand crayon. Wow, that's a lot. Yeah, we probably could have gotten someday out of these guys. Maybe we should retroactively and that how it works. Yeah, we get money out of Creola, and we get sued by praying, right, and then it all just comes out to ze right, we give praying our Creola money. Yeah. So, um Creole apparently also did a survey to find out what the top ten colors are of all time. Blue. That's my favorite color, but my favorite crayon's probably violet. That's the whole concept of it. Um, that's number three, Violet is number two is red, green is four, carnation, pink is five, black is six. Just try up black. You like the black cryan? Huh? Well for drawing lines, makes sense? I got it? Turquoise blue, blue, green, yeah, periwinkle, yeah my name, I think so too. But it's also a nice lovely type of silvery blue if I remember correctly, right, I think so silvery purplish. I'm not sure. I'm not very good with colors. Emily's great with that stuff, and it will ask her, Yeah, say what's periwinkle? Yeah, and she'll say it's but I need a thing. She'll say, like, oh, the whatever in our house is Perrywinkle. I got you know, I got you? Uh. And then magenta, yes, not big on magenta. Yeah, I think that's it. Chuck, what's your favorite of all time? I don't know. I don't think I have a favorite color of crayon or maybe at all. I see like black. Okay, we'll go with that, Johnny cash, Um, I do have one more thing. It's funny that one thing that we usually do is look at just when we're searching things online, we'll look at news just to see if there's anything breaking and believe it or not, I looked at crayons Crayola, and it was an eight minute old story, breaking story right before we record, like CNN breaking news, like actual breaking news. That's right, they have they're releasing a new blue this year. Uh. There was some scientists at Oregon State University Go Ducks, Ducks, No, that's University Oregon, Oregon State, the Loggers, Periwinkle Cowboys. Uh. The in two thousand nine at Oregon State, they were um doing some research trying to discover materials for electronics, and as often happens, and something accidental occurred, they mixed an oxide with some other chemicals, heated it up, and they discovered a brand new pigment of blue. In two thousand nine, why, I in m in yanman. I'm not sure how it's pronounced. That's not very marketable, but it's a very sort of cobalt. Yeah, this is very vivid blue. And uh, we should do something on pigments at some point, because I didn't. It's just weird to me that they could say, like, no, this is a brand new color, um, but let's definitely do that. It would be kind of interesting the science behind that. So Crayola is making uh this ynman into a and the outsourced that they let kids vote many many entrants, uh to this name, and they are naming it blutiful. Oh I know right, Yeah, it's like get your get your color naming staff back, get the team back together. Crayola Blutiful is what happens when you ask ten thousand six year olds. Uh so Bluetiful is coming out just in time for the holiday season. Well there, yeah, that's crayons, specifically Crayola crayons. Sorry for the buzz marketing, but we couldn't help it. Did we get organ state they're the cowboys right now. Thank you guest producer Matt for looking it up. I like periwinkle cowboys. Uh well, if you want to know more about crayons, go get some crayons, break them open and smell them. It'll tell you everything you need to know. And in the meantime, it's time for a listener mail. And I also want to say to the good people of praying once again, people should support praying as well as the o G at the very least, go out in diversify your crayon portfolio, you know, alright, like like Yamaha did with their feyboard and jet skis. That makes a little more sense. At least they knew how to make engines from a motorcycle. Um, all right, this is I'm reading another Satanist reply, but it felt like this one should be read. Hey guys, I'm a Christian pastor. As such, I hold strong religious convictions, and yet I've always found it incredibly important, both personally and professionally, to learn what I can about other belief systems. So you're doing it right, We're storing my faith in humanity. I want to thank you for the episode on the Church of Satan. It's not an organization that I've taken the opportunity to learn much about, perhaps out of fear or pride, but I found what you share to be very informational in any study of other belief systems. It is not only important to know what we disagree on, but perhaps just as importantly, but we do agree on. While there are clearly areas where Satanist and I would never agree, there are actually many things that we have in common. In a climate of increased divisiveness, is important to focus on what we share, not what divides us. Your episode open my mind and gave me new insight and for that I am incredibly grateful. Thank you for your show. Please keep up the good work. Isn't that great? Yeah? Uh signed peace. Reverend Lee Finish of Temple, Texas. Thank you, Reverend Lee soon to be former reverend. And this is uh Lee, Lady Lee, I saw that, but it could be a man. No, it's a lady. Oh it is well. Thank you, reverendly Again. Seriously, we heard from you and from one other reverend who basically said, you know, thanks for opening my eyes and and I I find it very interesting too. That's just opening their eyes but also like restoring their faith, like it confirmed their faith running out to church and Satan right it was challenged. They thought about it and they said, nope, I'm doubling down. And I feel good about this after being confronted with opposing viewpoints, critical thinking. Yeah, nicely done.
