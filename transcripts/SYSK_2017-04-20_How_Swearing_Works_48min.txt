Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant, uh and Jerry's over there. So this is stuff you should know beep. Addition, are we gonna beat No? I don't think so we're above that. Um. I'll tell you what. It was a joy to read this Tracy V. Wilson article. Tracy stuff you missed in history class. Used to do a lot of writing, and her articles are always she leaves no stone unturned. Yeah, the V. The V stands for very good article. It really was good. Yeah, it was very good article, very good, so very good. Did you did you notice her images in the article on the site? No, oh they were all like star Trek, Firefly, Harry Potter. What later in the article? Or was that from that other thing you sent me? Oh that was from another thing. Okay, No, I kind of just put it all in together, so I was like, man, Tracy really went for it. A lot of bombs. That was not Tracy. That was well. There are a couple of other articles I sent you. One was James Harbick wrote a good one on the BBC and another was from Rebecca roach On a On. Was that that swearing in other countries? Yeah, that was really good. Um, I'm excited about this one because I loved to curse and swear, and you folks don't know that because we've always kept our show g rated. I know, which is I'm glad we do that because I kind of stand out these days among podcasts. Yeah, that's true. Plus it's kind of like, um, it just makes it you have to get a little more creative when you have limitations like that. I found like working within a structure or makes you think more rather than just like letting it all hang out being loosey goosey lazy. Yeah, I'm very lazy than in my regular life. Well, my wife and I both have sailor mouth. Should we be telling people this? I don't think it's fine, Okay, because this is a good lesson to kids that, um, you know, there are appropriate times to say certain things in inappropriate times, and when you're podcasting, apparently it's inappropriate exactly at least with us. But chuck. Um. One thing you might be happy to hear is that a longstanding myth called the poverty of vocabulary hypothesis is not held to be correct any longer. Well, what's the myth? The hypothesis was that people swore because they couldn't think of other words, and that you were basically lower, lower class, poorly educated um with a small vocabulary, which is why you cursed. And up until fairly recently, I think it was a two thousand sixteen maybe fifteen journal article that really put the nail in the coffin and said, nope, we tested people. The people who came up with the most swear words were also the ones who had the most extensive vocabulary elsewhere too. So the idea that you're just dumb if you if you swear a lot normally gone. Yeah, But I mean there, it spends on how you do it. Like sometimes you can tell someone I can't think of a better word, you know what I mean? And sometimes like I know some people that are just some of the best swearers. Was most creative, intelligent swears And it's like a music almost. I love it it is, and it is a music. It's definitely not just words. As we'll see, swearing is its own thing. It's kind of phenomenal. Actually, there's a hypothesis that language came out of swears originally that the first took took, Yeah, it took took was basically hit his thumb with a club against the rock, shouted something, and that became the S word as we know it today. Well, Tracy, one of the first things she points out was a thought super interesting and that it's a very paradoxic, paradoxical thing, and that they are a taboo. But it's not a taboo that people avoid. It's one of the few taboos like everybody, not everybody, but many, many people in brace right, I think like seventy eight percent of men. And we're talking for the most of this show about sort of Western countries except at the end. But as far as we know, and we being like humanity, uh, swearing is universal. Here we go se of men and fifty eight percent of women swearing in public. It's not even in their private life. Yeah, yeah, you know. Yeah. And apparently that's a longstanding understanding of swearing, is that men do it more than women. And back in the seventies there was a Berkeley linguistics researcher named Rebecca lack Off, and um, she noticed that women tended more to use what are called minced oaths, which is saying like fiddle sticks instead of the F word, basically talking like ned flanders in places where men would have cursed otherwise um. And she surmised that it was because women are taught from a young age to be polite and preferential, um, whereas men are allowed to curse and kind of let it all hang out. But that just put women in an awkward situation or damned if they do, damned if they don't, uh situation. And that if they are polite and deferential, they're treated like a fractional person um. But if they transgress and and curse, they they've broken taboos. And like in Western society, it's way worse for a woman to curse than a man, at least in public or may be even private, which is a double standard that we need to do away with. Agreed, because it's much like the First Amendment episode where I got all rile up against obscenity. The idea that some words can't be said because it's taboo just irks me to no end as well. I don't think it's a big deal, but I do respect that others do, and I really do try to curb my how loud I curse in public? Public in public's Um, I really do. I try to, like, and this isn't just since I've had kids. Have always just sort of tried to be aware. Maybe it was my Baptist upbringing, but um, it's bad of a mouth. As I have, I've always tried to just sort of be aware of my surroundings because I never wanted to be that guy that was making someone else feel bad or whose parents had to like shuffle their kids away from me because of the language I was using. You know. Um, I've had a hard time with Emily. Yeah, yeah, she's just she doesn't now she's louder and doesn't just she's just not a She's in the moment, you know. She's very free spirited, and I'm always like, oh, you know there's kids right out there, can you keep it down. She's like, if it f that kid, if that kid, just it. Um. But Tracy just has a lot of little tidbits here at the beginning. I think we should mention because they're just interesting. One is that people, and I found this to be true when I worked in at a Mexican restaurant. We all learned the curse words first, and when you learn a new language, it's one of the first things you learn if you learn through immersion rather than in a classroom, are colloquially colloquialisms and curse words, although she says curse words and swear words are different. Yeah, so we should you want to say, with the differences, so, um, most people use them interchangeably. But a curse word is where you're basically hexing something. You're you're calling for someone to be well damned, yeah, or anything good. Idea like F this window that I can't get open, that's a curse on that window, exactly, you're right, um. Whereas swearing is kind of different. It's like by Odin's raiding, where you're invoking the name of like a deity or something religious or whatever, and you're doing that to like give weight to your your words, your or I swear to God as a swear and technically, if you are a if you're a pious type, swearing to God, it's going to be as bad as saying F that window, if not worse. Actually the worst is you know, if you say g D. I remember growing up and as a church kid, that was that was the worst of all swear words. Yeah, right, you know, taking the Lord's name in vain? Yeah, and that can be and most basically all words, will you swearing curse interchangeably like any normal human being. But um, most most swear words are all swear words I believe can be broken down into two category and one of them is deistic, where it involves a like a higher authority, God, religion, something about that, right, and um. The other is visceral, and that is basically everything else it involves body parts, body function. It's funny they really do break down into this. Yeah, basically everything does it related to the body? Are related to God? Pretty interesting? Yeah it is. And and again that seems to be universal. But what one culture emphasizes another culture might not. And even within the same culture over a period of time. Uh, words can change. Emphasis on words can change. Like, for example, in the nineteenth century, you did not say bull as in look at that bowl over there, yes, because it was associated with sexual virility. So you would say, look at that brute cow over there, or look at that sea docks, anything but bull because it was a bad word at the time. And then now it's like someone would look at you like, what what the Hell's the sea docks. Is that why bs is has bull in front of it. I wonder if it's like a particularly virulent type of of fallacy or lie, because I don't see why else it would. That's what I thought too. Tracy also says that UM, no one really knows because cursing came before writing what the first swear words were UM, but researchers agree. And this I thought was super interesting is that um they called it word magic, early forms of word magic, or where they came from, which um basically means, especially in cultures that didn't have writing, they believe that words had a lot of power and you could curse something like we said, like words could be really good or words could be really bad, and that swearing kind of evolved out of that, right, which is just awesome. I love it. It is um And there is a good example of this. Apparently. Our word for bear here in English is rooted from the Germanic word for brown, and it was based on the pagan Germanic taboo against saying the name of a wild animal because it might make that wild animal appear because of word magic. So that's why we say bear today. So interesting because something like ursa would have been. It would have made the bear appear and killed everybody, and it would have been your fault because you didn't say brown. He said, ursa. Did you ever hear the for unlawful carnal knowledge acronym? That's completely not true. Um that the F word is old, very old recording in English since the fifteenth century, and they found some roots of it back in Middle Dutch f o k k e n was to thrust or copulate, Norwegian f u k k a was copulate, and in Swedish f o uk meant penis uh. And apparently even though it was around, it wasn't really used in common speech though much It was like a word in English. Yeah, but it wasn't really used as a curse word until much later on. Yeah, like the I think the sixteenth centuries when it first appears in writing, and even then it seemed kind of casual. Yeah, just a casual. I've got another one. You're ready. Zounds. You know that word, uh, zounds? I think like Shaggy used to say it a lot, He said, zinks. Yeah, somebody said zounds Encyclopedia Brown. I don't know, so zounds sounds like that yeah. Is Um, it's related to God's wounds. So you're saying God's wounds, Yeah, invoking a deity, So that would be a deistic curse. Wow. I can't wait till the end when we go around the world. Some of those are really funny. Um, should we take a break, Yeah, all right, we'll take a break and talk a little bit about why people swears skulk Alright, So this makes a lot of sense. There's a lot of there's a line of thought that says that swearing eventually it comes to take the place of crying. Yeah. I thought this was there's a lot of anecdotal evidence. It makes perfect sense, makes total complete sense. Yeah, because when you're a kid, you cry about things, and then when you grow up here in the West, you're, for some reason taught not to cry anymore, especially little boys, which is totally us, says Rosie Greer. Yeah, I cry all the time. Uh, And so that swearing becomes a what they call an instinctive response for if you're upset, or if you're afraid, or if something bad happens, if you're frustrated, and that just kind of takes the place of crying. Yeah, which again both makes it tremendous. Do you swear while you're crying? Because no, I don't do the ugly cry. We should probably get a judgment call from our legendary producer Jerry about is it okay for us to say if it in place of actual bad words here Jerry says, yes, we need a ding ding ding. So Um, that makes total sense to me that you learned to swear. And one of the reasons why it makes total sense to me is that swearing is a way of letting off pressure valve suddenly and quickly, almost involuntarily, right, um. And if you can do it out of anger, you can do it out of frustration, you can do it out of shock, surprise, pain, um. And yeah, and and at least in the context of our society, it would be weird if you cried in all those situations of an adult when you can get it over with just by saying shouting the S word or the F word or something like that. You know. Um. And Actually, there's a linguist named Jeoffrey Nowmberg. I probably screwed up his name, but he had this great description of swear words. He said, swear words don't describe your feelings. They manifest them, which is absolutely true. I've seen it put as like a quick verbal hand grenade. Um. It encapsulates a feeling and in in like a really potent condensed form. It's true. So bam um. Another really cool um thing that that Tracy wrote about was that um they do a lot too. They can establish a group identity, They can make you feel like a part of a group. UM. They can express like intimacy or trust with someone. They aren't just regular words beyond shock value and humor, which are all valid, but beyond camouflaging your fears which is valid. They really can Like I remember, I remember in our one of our first editorial meetings and how stuff works years ago when our former boss who gave us the the charge to do stuff you should know, dropped f bombs in the meeting. And and this was the first kind of like my stupid chicken killer software job that I had. I was like a frat house, so that didn't count. Like the language and there was terrible, But this was my first like real job where yeah, where I thought like, all right, I'm in my first like meeting and he starts dropping f bombs and I immediately felt a kinship and I was like, all right, this guy is doing something. He's laying this out to the room, and that means something. You know, it wasn't a casual thing. If you drop an F bomb in a meeting like that, you're you're telling people something. Yeah, like it's okay to use that language here, or this is what kind of person I am. It really gives off a lot of social cues. Yeah, you know, I've always loved them for it. It really does. It's also um it also kind of presents the person of higher authority on on your level. You know, it can turn people off, though I did think about that, like, man, I wonder if there's people in here that are offended by this? Well it is, there's a real um. I mean, foul language can be offensive, and the this really great article by Rebecca roach On Aon basically posits that it's offensive because when you are using foul language in front of somebody, you know that there's a chance that it's going to offend them, and you're doing it anyway. So basically, purposefully creating an atmosphere where someone probably will be offended is the whole reason why bad language is offensive. Yeah, it's like it's agreed upon between the two parties, Like, there are certain words that if I use in this conversation, you might get offended or you might feel more included. Right, And because I know that you might get offended, and I'm doing it anyway, I'm saying to heck with your offense, which again creates the offensiveness in the first place. It's oh wow, what could you It's a dirty word. Um, well, I guess we should talk about social response a little bit, because that's kind of where we're headed. But um it didn't like obscenities and dirty words weren't even really looked it that way until after the eighteen hundreds. Now, there were taboo words for sure, but they weren't considered dirty. It was just taboo like don't invoke Odin's raven right. But like, the word profanity didn't come around till the nineteenth century, which is really interesting. Yeah, you know, and originally profan the and blasphemy meant the same thing. They both had to do with basically insulting the sacred um, and then over time they started to diverge. Blasphemy for me still means the same thing, whereas profanity now is a general catch all for for what we would call swear words or curse words are dirty words. Right, Even though there's a in all cultures, there's a definite hierarchy. Yeah, of you know, if your kid says d A M N, not the biggest deal, No, just maybe to bed without dinner for a few nights. And if your kid is dropping F bombs, you know that it ranks or worse. You know, some people think the F bomb is the worst thing you can do. That there, Yes, that's just playing wrong. I'm sorry, at least in this day and age. Yes, Um, that hierarchy you talk about seems to fall into a couple of categories. Even though have a hierarchy is universal, what is at the top of the hierarchy is not. UM. One of the things that frequently is found at the top of the hierarchy around the world is UM, moms your mother. There are plenty of very different cultures around the world, UM where insulting your mother, particularly either a sexual act with your mother or UM bringing up your person's mother's genitalia UM is the is the worst. It's the worst of the worst. Oh yeah, I remember, like I said in college, when I worked at that Mexican place. We learned all the course words first, and the guys in the kitchen. I was like, man, you guys talk about each other's mom more than anything I've ever heard in my life. It was remarkable, and that must be And I guess in Um, I guess, is Spain listed or Spanish languages? Well, it's a it's Latin languages, Latin based languages, so Spanish would definitely fall under that togory. Yeah, but also um, I believe Mandarin, um Arabic, some Arabic languages just languages around like like really disparate cultures have said like leave the moms out of this. Well it was also funny too because she followed up with um. Sometimes in Bosnia it's uh, your father, it can be a really big insult or grandfather, um in Albanian your family, Turkish, your extended family. And finally Mandarin, which is your ancestors to the eighteenth generation. There it is man that is the best swear on the planet. F your ancestors to the eighteenth generation. I wish I knew how to pronounce this. It's just that's as good as it gets. Cow needs a zong sheba dae oh you know we this is available in China. Yeah good, I'm gonna learn how to say that, like for real, little kids in China listen to this. The whole classics point. I need to learn how to say very sorry. Then gasping is universal too. But speaking of swearing at work, um, supposedly swearing at work makes up three of the conversation. That's what it said. That sounds low to me. I saw a two thousand and sixteen study that found that women curse more than men at work. More women admit to cursing at work then man, but frequency wise, men curse more. So if the average man who curses at work is placed beside the average woman who curses at work, the man's gonna curse more frequently. But if you fill the room with the women who curse at work and the man who curse at work, there'll be more women. Does that for explained? Really confused? Well? And then apparently among millennials, sixty six percent of millennials say they curse at work, and then of baby boomers curse at work, which if you put that together, comes out to be a hundred and twenty. So that makes like zero sense. If you fooled me. Um, if you're talking about the law. Depending on where you are, there may be some arcane laws on the books that prevent you from cursing in public. Um, but it's definitely you know, we did one on free speech recently. It definitely does not qualify as protected speech. It depends what can Yeah, alright, So like if you're just walking down the street and you say, if you pig to a cop, you're gonna get arrested, but there's a pretty good chance that your case is going to get ultimately thrown out if you, Um, if you were in Pennsylvania, you are going to well, depending on the town, and you curse in public, you say, f the Steelers, Oh man, you made you you you should count your lucky stars if you make it safely to jail, unless you're in Philadelphia, well there you go. Um. Apparently in Pennsylvania they were arresting people left and right for um, well citing them, giving them citations for cursing in public, and UM, it finally got to the point where the A c L You got involved and said, what are you doing. You can't do this. This is protected speech. This is curse in public, and it's a. It's a gray area. Actually, like states, there are states, like you said, that have some laws on the books, and apparently one of them is Pennsylvania, and they were enforcing it, and I don't know if they still are or not, but pretty recently they were, um, they were giving people citations for it. And in Michigan they had a law overturned as recently as two thousand two where it was illegal to cuss in front of women and children. And some guy was canoeing down the Rifle River. His canoe was overturned. He was in the water cursing up storm and there were women, children, elderly there. He he was arrested and um taken to jail, and the Michigan Court of Appeals said, no, this is a hundred year old law. While and the guy overturned his cannete like give him a break, right exactly, give the guy a break, and he um he got off. His case was thrown out and they said, we're this law of null and void. By the way, so there is speech protection and it is taken to extend to the state level. But again it's a gray area because if you did that on TV, you could certainly be fined and that would be upheld because we've long agreed that there are certain situations where you shouldn't curse because kids might hear it. But what's the difference of doing it on TV and doing it in front of a kid? Only the courts can say, well, yeah, and that's an FCC thing. And there are certain words, like you know George Carlin's famous words you can't say on television. Um, but those are rules more than laws, aren't they Or I guess yeah, I guess they are rules, rules and regulations. Yeah, but but they are upheld. Yeah. But like private organizations and like if you're in a store or a movie theater or at work, like they can they can prevent you from doing that stuff. Can you can be asked to leave? Um, you can be asked off a plane, you know stuff hopefully while it's on the ground. Yeah. Yeah, if you're if you're a company, you can. Yeah. It's like in the mall episode, I think we talked about where First Amendment protection doesn't extend to private area. Yeah, you can have a policy, um yeah, and it can be like some people can consider that a hostile work environment. Yeah, if you have you know, a real potty mouth boss. It makes everybody feel uncomfortable because cursing can go. You know, it's one thing to say you know bs or F this, but if you like get really creative with your curse words. Well, Plus there's a difference between F this and F you, especially coming from a boss. Sure, so yeah, you can switch it really is. It's the best. Um, all right, should we take a break and talk about the brain? Yess sk sk So we're back, ready to talk about the brain. Got the top of my skull removed and Chuck has finger in the ventral dorsal interior postulate. If I'm not mistaken, I thought this is where it got really interesting. Yeah, because it supports all that anecdotal evidence, all of it. Yeah, alright, so the parts of the brain, um, the cerebral cortex. I guess we should go through all this. Huh. I was gonna break it down to the big line at the end, but we'll go through it all. Yeah, you gotta build it up where showman. If anything that the cerebral cortex has pre motor and motor areas. They control the speech and writing. It's kind of like the higher function. And then we talked before about Wernike's area. Um, jeez, we talked about that a bunch. I feel like, well, it's pretty interesting it is, uh. And they recognize and process words spoken words, and then you have your prefrontal cortex, which like helps regulate your what's your social behaviors and stuff. It's a higher, higher function. It's all these things. Was about to say, you're working together, but they're kind of not when it comes to cursing, right when it comes to language, they're all working together, but like we said before, swears there something different. They're separate, yes, and scientifically in fact they are. Yeah. So they they involve different parts of the brain than language processing. UM. The limbic system, which is part of your reward system or the basis of your word system, but also has to do with housing memory UM, has to do with regulating emotion, basic behaviors. UM. And apparently they think that in primates and some animals, vocalization is based in the Olympic system, just like like that thing that Tim Allen does that would be limbic system based, weird, like oinking bark he does. I've literally never seen anything, Tim Allen. I'm not about to do it. So you're gonna have to go look it up on YouTube. Uh. And then the basil ganglia, which is motor motor function, yeah, and impulse control. Those two things which have basically nothing to do with language processing, higher processing and humans are what governed swear words. Yeah, Like Tracy says that they're the scientists think that it all takes place in those lower regions. It's all emotion and instinct, and that the brain doesn't even process a swear word like a word like as what are they called phone ms phonemes, Yeah, phonemes, Like the parts that make up the word. The curse word is just the word as a whole as far as the brain is concerned. Like when you hear the word articulation, there's a part of your brain in the left hemisphere. The region is going to work taking articulation emphasis you put on it, putting it together, running it against your memory banks or context or whatever, and saying, oh, I know what you just said. But if somebody shouts the S word, those parts of your brain are not springing into action. It's the parts of your brain that are involved in experiencing, in recognizing emotions, The very very ancient parts of your brain that are involved in which gives credence to that hypothesis that language evolved out of expletives. Well, and also in that one article you sent the theory that it's not even a theory, just kind of the thought that a curse word isn't even a word so much as it is like a yell yes, I mean, it could might as well just be yeah. It's just you've got four letters, and if you think about it, it makes uttering complete sense, like even the worst of the worst, you know, where you're involving somebody's mom in the worst possible way. You're when somebody says that, even when they're especially I should say, when they're saying it to insult you specifically, your brain doesn't dial up that image. It doesn't have to know. You're not thinking about the actual meaning of the word. You're responding to the emotional punch and the gut you just took from that word, Like you know what that word means. I mean, the thing they mean on a on a very emotional level, like you have it stored away in that sense. Yeah, because most times curse words almost always there aren't to be taken literally, right like when uh in the one who was the guy who wrote that one, Uh, that that you sent from the BBC James Harbick. Yeah, like talking about the F word, they're like ten different ways you can use it. Well, that was Stephen Pinker. He was refrained, Okay, yeah, and none of them are you should take literally, and no one does take them literally. You just know what it means if you say it or F or F you you're not literally saying engage in sex with this thing, you know. Yeah, and you think the person was a weirdo who just topped you if they did at your command. Well, which is another reason why we let people that are just learning to speak English off the hook when they say curse words, because they don't understand the difference between the literal meaning and the expression, right, So no offense is intended, right, right, so that social contract is not there yet exactly. It's just hilarious when they do it accidentally. It really is. Yeah, was it? What was it? Stripes to speak English? You know. Framus is teaching them very good stuff. Uh. And so they've done f m r I studies to that show that functional magnetic resonance imaging tests uh, to show that higher and lower parts of the brain can struggle with each other when they swear. And apparently the people who really pride themselves and being super educated and very literate people, uh, they respond to slang and illiterate quote, illiterate phrases the same as they do swear words. And this one is weird to me. Um. They've done studies where you identify the color or word is written in, not the word, but the color, and the swear word distracts them from the color of that word. This's is crazy. They literally exist in their own space. Yeah, they are their own thing for sure, you know. Yeah, and you remember them supposedly you remember swear words four times better than other words. It's nuts. But what makes it, I think what's super interesting to me is that there's their universal and there's distinctions, but they're also you know, you can divide most things in most swear words into just a couple of different categories across the board, you know, but there they're not given thought, but they're based on things that you learn. So for example, chuck starting to go around the world, shall we alright, are we there yet? So? In uh French Quebec, it's an extraordinarily catholic Um society and basically all of their swear words have to do with the Catholic Mass, like the chalice, the tabernacle, the host um, the these literally these words like you say tabernacle and it's that's bad man, that's a really bad, bad word. And it has to do with the idea that you're bringing the sacred into um. You're basically blaspheming and it's a it's a big time taboo. But the idea that that's a learned like you have to, like you don't look at a a tabernacle and a true church as a kid without being you know, the first time you were walking to a church and say that's the holiest thing there is. I understand everything there is to know about it so much so that I can break a taboo by saying that word. You have to learn that. But the idea that that when you do learn it, it's stored as an emotion in your brain, as a motor function, rather than as a word that your higher cognition refers to or brings forth. It's just astounding to me. It is it's like a parallel process to learning language. Absolutely, um, there are languages where uh like it's different in a lot of countries, but it's also the same. Like when you talk about like the feces. Uh, there are many different languages that use the word feces there whatever word for it as a swear word. Um, including English of course, UM, French, German, um, they all have Albania, They all have words for feces that are curse words. But then it's not arbitrary. I guess it just spends on how it, you know, came to be in that country. But in Sweden, which is you know, in that neighborhood, Uh, you can say skit when you're annoyed, but it doesn't count as a curse word, right, like you could They said you could say to run a grandmother. Yeah, so so it's a curse word. But the the importance, the emphasis that of a taboo that it breaks depends on the culture. Yeah, or like another kind of like in Polish they'll use cholera, and other countries use types of disease like canker in in the Dutch. Yeah, isn't that crazy, Yeah, the canker meaning cancer, So you you are basically wishing cancer on somebody, which is pretty awful. Yeah, that would be a curse that's not done here, But if you did do it in in you know, normal discussion or even an argument here in the West, there'd be like a record scratch, a needle scratching off a record, be like, what did you just say? That was the worst thing that's been said to me in months? But you just have a word for it. Yeah, I never really thought about that. That That would be terrible thing to say it if you said that just in a sentence to someone in English, especially if you were like jabbing your finger in their chest while you're saying it. You know, that's right. I know. We have a lot of listeners in Sweden, uh, Swedish um people apparently the same with finn Finland and uh, Norway and Denmark. They put a lot of emphasis on the devil. Oh yeah, so like some of their worst swear words are um based on satan, hell um, the devil, that kind of thing. Yeah, so you don't want to you don't want to bring that up, or else you might offend your hosts in Sweden. Prostitution apparently a lot of cultures. Uh. And this this theory makes sense. Process it's defire wife's exclusivity in a man's ownership, which is why a lot of words people will use for prostitute can be a swear word against somebody. Yeah, and apparently cultures that where bringing someone's mother into it is is the is the top of the hierarchy will also have um words for prostitutes, like plenty of words for prostitutes, and those will be extremely bad words as well. So it's like those things kind of go hand in hand, yeah, which from what I've seen, has to do with the patriarchy creating the moral hierarchy, right, because it's such a male view of things, like you're my mom, so you're the most sacred thing around, and you're a prostitute, which means I can't control you. So invoking those things are the two worst things you can talk about. And then our last step to me chuck in Japan, yes, bacca Bacca means basically idiot, but it you don't call people that, it's a really bad word, which I think is so sweet. I love that country. Idiot that's bad, yeah, and I think about how much how often we call people idiots here in the US. Yeah, but that's bad though. I remember my mom team like, don't don't say that. Word. Oh she was right. Yeah. Still she's not even Japanese, she's some Tennessee a little Japanese in it, maybe so Japanese streak. UM. So I guess we will finish up here with a little bit on um. What can happen when your brain is damaged. And we've talked about a little bit of this stuff before, but there's some pretty interesting things uh. In terms of brain injury UM. Something called aphasia UH is a condition where you can lose your ability to speak or pronounce words because of disease or brain damage. But UM A phase A, PHASEX have an interesting thing. They can return to their ability of automatic speech, which is just like saying things like um and uh uh. But the other thing that comes back, or swear words, which ties all back into the thing, is they exist as their own in their own category, almost like non speech exactly. So that's one of the first things that can come back um or never go away, yeah or never go away. And when they um, their ability pronounced words can evolve while they're recovering, but the swear words stay the same. Right Like apparently you can have a hemispherictomy on the left of the left lobe where a substantial part of the left lobe goes away and you can't talk any longer, but you can say, yes, we're just fine. That must be startling, I'm sure you know. Yeah. Uh, and we did. We did a great episode on Tourette syndrome quite a while back, and we talked about corporalia and that is um. I think a lot of people have this image of someone with turette, you know, just constantly screaming swear words. And it's actually a very small number and it's that's actually called copper laia, not turette, and um, a very small number of people with GTS exhibit copper lawya, right, very very very small. Yeah, and it's I think it even I think you even grow out of it in most cases too. Right. Apparently younger males are the ones who are more likely to have that as a tick with Tourette syndrome. But it also makes sense in that um swearing can be viewed as a motor function with a motion attached, right, Yeah, And a tick is a has to do with the motor function, whether it's your head twitching or shouting the S word a few times. Yeah, still a tick, um My last thing here is I think Pinker, I think it was really interesting and that he noted that swear words were often most often just very uh just the sound itself, you know, being real, just harsh, and that that contributes a lot to their function, like when you get hurt or when you're just trying to exclaim something loudly, like the F word, it's as that very sharp k at the end um. And if you expressed anger using gentler sounds like he says wiffy and slush, it's just he compares it. What do you say, It's like slamming a door fitted with a compressed air hinge. It's just not the same thing, right, There's something about those sharp quick words ends and kay's and teas, you know that our staccato that just sort of provide that visceral you know release. Yeah, I think yeah that was Rebecca Roach who use the analogy with the hydraulic which is perfect its wify door. Yeah. Um, But but we should finish on Pinker's um seven functions of swearing. All right? What are they? They? So? I swear word? No, I'm sorry. Five functions that we could make up another two swear words. They can be used descriptively. Uh, I can't give an example of that one. Idiomatically. Okay, it's ft up abusively f you Yeah, emphatically, this is an amazing yeah. Um and cathartically, which is f right, which it makes swears pretty interesting things. Yeah, and um, I mean Tracy puts some tips in there for when you have children on how to regulate that and explain things. But um, you know, just a parent the way you want a parent apparently though you're not supposed to laugh, that's impossible. Yeah, laugh and clap and pat him on the head. Yeah, by my toy. Yeah, my kids at the age where she repeats everything. And I hurt myself the other day and let out an F bomb and she said it right after me. And there's nothing funnier. Wow. Do you have it on tape? No? Um, But she does say the word fox, the animal fox. Um, she says that as the other word, and we do have that on tape. It's funny. I'd like to see that. Yeah, I'll show it to you. It's um, it's good. And you know, it's just a reality that we curse in my household. And you know, my kids probably gonna be one of those kids that curses earlier than other kids. But I'm hoping to kind of cross that bridge and be like, hey, listen, can't say these things in school. You can't say him in front of teachers. I remember when a teacher would curse, how like no shocking that was. I don't think I ever experienced no like the teacher on a bad day that the class is just pushed and they would just break down and scream a curse word that never happened. Oh man, I had. It happened a couple of times, and it is talk about like the social contract. Nothing will make a bunch of kids like straighten up faster than hearing you. They're just like, oh man, like Mrs So and so, has we've pushed her too far? Or when a kid curses at a teacher, there was also that like oh boy, yeah, that's huge, like trouble. Yeah. So yeah, I'm hoping to teach my daughter it's too pick and choose. Yeah, maybe she'll grow up to be like Red Fox make money off of the cursing. Maybe so or Sarah Silverman, Yeah, who's like the modern Red Fox. Well, she definitely has made a career out of breaking taboos with language for shock shock value. She's great. Yep yea. So it's Red Fox so too r I p uh red Fox not Sarah Silverman's. If you want to know more about Red Fox there Silverman swearing. Any of that stuff. You can type those words in the search part how stuff works dot com. And since I said search parts, time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this notable Canadian filibuster. You folks may have noticed we had a Saturday episode on filibusters. And that's a new thing we're doing called s Y s K selects, where we we republished a Saturday episode that we think was great or relevant. Um, in case you missed it. And um, thanks for the support on those apparently support we mean thanks for listening, right yeah, yeah, they're still free. Um. So Blake listened to the filibuster one and he wrote in about a Canadian filibuster. Hey, guys quite enjoyed the episode about filibusters. Although I've worked for several years at various legislatures throughout Canada can tell you that filibustering is not unique to the U. S. Senate. My favorite example of the filibuster took place in the Canadian Senate. Parliamentary proceedings in Canada are recorded and published verbatim and hands aard uh. Canada being a bilingual country means that the hands are hands. Art is available in both English and French, meaning that staff not only have to transcribe everything said, but translators also need to translate English speeches into French and vice versa for official publicity. I'm sorry, publicly available record. Why is this topical because during one particularly contentious filibuster believe related to trade agreement in the late eight nineteen eighties, one senator stood and read the entirety of his autobiography into the record. As you can expect, this took quite a bit of time. That not only did it delay passage of the bill, the common mythology to the senator also to this in order to get a free, professional quality translation of his autobiography, which was subsequently published in French. Wow, that's from Blake Evans. That's that's a good one, Blake. Thank you for the Canadian history lesson. We don't get enough of that down here. Um. I have one. I have a call out for Canadians. I've always just made fun of it as fake Thanksgiving, but I realized I never have figured out why Thanksgiving as celebrated a month or so early, well early compared to the US in Canada, so let us know exactly that's a different way of looking at it.
