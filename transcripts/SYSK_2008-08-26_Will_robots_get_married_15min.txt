Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from How Stuff Works dot Com? Stuff you should know is brought to you by Visa. We all have things we like to think about. Online fraud shouldn't be one of them, because with every purchase, PISA prevents to texts and resolves online fraud safe secure Visa. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, staff writer here at how Stuff Works dot Com. With me is always is Charles Chuck Bryant, also staff writer here at how Stuff Works dot Com. What up? Staff writer Chuck? Well, Josh, I think, as you can see, I'm just snuggled up with my real doll here. I did notice, Chuck if wasn't going to bring it up. She is a looker. She will give you that. Um, but she is what poly ethylene? Maybe I don't ask you and she doesn't answer, so I'm sure she doesn't. That reminds me of a movie. Um, I haven't seen you. I've been told by several will definitely see it. Lars and the Real Girl. Yep, I've seen it. It's really good And how is this good little indie. It's got Ryan Gosling. He's really great actor. No spoilers, Chuck, I haven't seen it yet, Okay, okay, go ahead. But the basic plot outline is that he plays this lonely guy who gets a real doll. And it's a real girl doll, right, Yes, is that what they're called? And uh? And I had asked Samantha, but she wouldn't answer. Um. And so he has this doll in the in the town kind of just accepts it as being his girlfriend. And it's worth Yeah, it's really it sounds really creepy, but it's actually kind of a sweet movie. Well you know that's uh, that's actually not too far off, um from what some people are predicting, is going to be uh part of the future of humanity. Too far off at all at robot human weddings. Um. And we're not even talking real girls here. We're talking about real girls that like super and real girls, yes, exactly. Um. And apparently there's this guy named David Levy who is uh, I think some sort of future US maybe a roboticist. But he he wrote a paper um based on research he did in philosophy, UM, sexology, which to tell you the truth. Until I read his article, UM, I didn't realize it was an actual discipline. Um, robotics, of course, all sorts of other stuff. Uh, sexology. It's like the greatest word ever. It sounds like an MTV show, it really does, or like a drink you get in cancoon right. Um. So Levy combines all these disciplines together and comes up with the notion that by um, some states, starting with Massachusetts, deposits will allow human robot weddings marriages legally recognized. Yeah. In fact, I believe he said quote it is inevitable. Yes, he didn't even before that, though, another roboticists predicted that by should not too far off from uh, people will be having sex with robots, which I mean once you start having sex with something, if you if, if somebody eventually wants to marry it. We are a moral species. Yeah, you could argue that we're not, but yeah, generally you're right. Just like in Larger than Real Girl, he had a lot of respect for his real doll and I don't want to ruin it, Please don't chuck, But it was it was a relationship based on, if not mutual, at least one way respect right right. But um, with with this, it's uh, it's with a robot, it's going to be much more um mutual. I don't know about necessarily feelings for for robots. I don't think we were going to reach that point, but it will appear a lot more mutual because they can program respect or at least things that you can say that would indicate right right now. Um. One of the things that's that's leading the way that's going to be allowing things like robots that people would want to have sex with or marry, um is like this the skin that's being developed. There's a guy who used to work for Disney. He's a roboticist who uh created the skin that bunches and wrinkles. And when you have lifelike skin, you can can a emotions through lifelike facial expressions. Right once you start having that, you you've got a really realistic looking robot. Yeah. I don't think I'll ever go to the Hall of Presidents again with the same eyes. No, exactly, Abraham Lincoln for the head of Abraham Lincoln. Right. Um. This whole this whole issue of possibly marrying robots and definitely having sex with robots has has brought to the attention of some people. Uh, the concept of robot rights. You have you heard of robot rights? I mean the movement behind it. Yeah, I know. Japan was is kind of at the forefront of this whole thing. They are now, but they were lagging for a little while. Um. At first it was just South Korea, UM and Europe. Basically Japan was conspicuously absent from the table. And they're they're at the forefront of robotics. They needed to be there, so they finally caught up and now they're they're all about robot rights. UM. And a lot of people are kind of like, what is this, Why would we even have robot rights? This is ridiculous as silly. Uh. And to those people proponents of robot rights, say, you ever heard of animal rights? Uh? Yeah, isn't that technically, you know, a silly idea in the same vein, But if you if you really think about it, these are animals. But we've we humans have established rights for how we interact with them, how we allow them to interact with and it's accepted now. And I think a lot of people years ago might have thought the same thing about animal rights. Right as they do about robot rights, right, and I think UM with robots, especially with robots that can give like a lifelike appearance where we're really awful things are going to come out of humans. You know, Like if if you have a robot that can recoil and horror or wins in pain, there's going to be people out there who are going to want to like kill them, like a drift or something like that. Right. The potential for abuse is big, and it's yeah, real abuse on a robot, but there's still something sociopathic about it, definitely. But I I predict that once um lifelike robots are available UM and produced on mass, I think there's going to be a lot of awful stuff. And I think that it's good that we're preparing for this now because I think the first half of the century is going to see an explosion in advancements and robotics. Yeah. I think South Korea said a robot in every house by the year Yeah, in that same year. Actually, the US has said that it plans to UH supplement one fifth of its battalions with robots, which raises a whole other question. I mean, like, do robots that UM kill people are designed to kill people. Are they afforded any kind of rights? Should they exactly? Should they be free from harm? That kind of thing? Right, It's really it's it's too much for my brain to be honest. Let me get in the driver's seat here, chuck the problem. So basically the main argument is that no, uh, a robot that's programmed to kill should be able to have harm done to it. Right, Most robots that we're going to interact with aren't going to be designed to kill. If you see a robot that you know is designed to kill, you should turn and run really fast. Um, because it only needs programmed to do one thing, right, yeah, kill, kill kill Um. So most of the robots we're going to interact with will be helping around the house, serving in the sex trade. Um, they already have those. Not the sex trade, although they may. But you know the little the robots that clean the floor and they do things like that, well, yeah, the roomba and the scuba and all that kind of concept. Right, these things are going to look a lot more lifelike. Like, if you want one doubt Fire, you can have Mrs doubt Fire working for you if you shell out enough cash. So Let's say you you have Mrs doubt Fire is a household robot, and Mrs doubt Fire is bringing you a hot cup of coffee. Unfortunately, Mrs Doubtfire trips and uh spills the hot coffee on you, and you get up and react by smacking Mrs doubt Fire across the face. Should you be penalized for that? Should you be punished? Right? And I think that's what Japan and some other South Korea are trying to work out, are the parameters of what's allowed and what's not allowed, and whether or not robots should have rights just like you and I. Right now, let's say Mrs doubt Fire um doesn't trip, but she walks up to you and pours the hot coffee on you. Who's responsible for that? The magality, the manufacturer of the robot? In my mind, I'm no lawyer, right well that they no one has any idea. All these questions are totally up in the air right now, and they're trying to hammer them out. Um and and the whole thing kind of goes both ways. Actually, humans are going to also need protection from robots, which is where Mr Isaac Asimov comes in, right Yeah, science fiction writer Isaac Asimoff. I think first, uh, he was really one of the first people to talk about robots and humans living together and getting along or not getting along. And uh. He established the three laws of robotics. I think in one of his short stories, running Around. I think, yeah, Runaround, which was actually in a collection of short stories called I Robot, which Will Smith, as you know, made into a pretty substandard film, which he borrowed from a couple of these, and he actually used the three laws of robotics. They refer to those in the film as well. You want to give him the three laws, I will, A robot may not injure a human being uh, or through an action, allow human to come to harm. Great first law, Yeah, A robot must obey orders given given it by humans, except where such orders would conflict with the first law. And uh, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law. Right. And these laws just sound like there's no way around him. Yeah. I was reading a critical analysis of asimov um and basically the author pointed out that I don't think he didn't think Asthmov thought these things were water tight. He basically used to like to use them as a theme to show how even these really great cohesive uh closed system laws could threw up. Um. Which is why nobody's going to go to Asimov to figure out how to program robots in the future. But we do need some some level of protection, like um our robots just kept from interacting with humans altogether, Like a robot cannot touch a human. Is that something that that we would do? Um, there's and there's already you know, there's been casualties. Um, there's been death by robots happened already. Uh. The first one happened in two when a guy was crushed on a factory line by you know, a big robotic arm pretty not really but yeah, kind of um. And then since then a lot of people have died. Actually one one guy. The worst death by robot that I've heard so far was um. Uh, a guy had a enough of an amount of molten aluminum poured on him by a robot that it killed him. I wonder if he was trying to make a little robot buddy. I don't, I don't know. Maybe, so we're hoping not. We were talking about industrial robots. The thing is these are isolated incidents, But what happens when there is a robot in every house and not only Korea but the world, These accidents could step up quite a bit, and you know, we need to figure out how to how to address them now before it happens. UM. And also, I think a lot of roboticists are really worried about the moment when robots are equipped with systems that allow them to learn right. When that happens, they lose all predictability whatsoever, and and we won't be able to tell what they're about to do, what they won't do, that they'll be as they'll be as unpredictable as humans. And you know, when you're on the subway with somebody you don't really trust your you got your like your muscles tensed in your ribs for a knifeing. You know, the same thing would happen with the humans and robots. And I think so it's probably even a little more creepy because while humans are unpredictable, robots, you don't know what they're programmed to do if it's not your robots, right, and also there's also issues of morality that would factor into that. UM. You know, you like to think that most humans would stop themselves from stabbing you even if they wanted to, because they have some some sort of moral judgment. How do you program morals into robots? You know? Um, it's a it's a very big, sticky ball of questions. I have to say, I am pretty glad that the people who are trying to figure this out now are figuring it out now, and there are a lot smarter than I am. Exactly. It's it's kind of one of the situations I would kick back and say, go to it. Yeah, I would have no idea. Yeah, yeah, hopefully they won't use their advantage to make us their slaves though, Yeah, I agree. So that's about that for robot marriages. But there's even more in the article that I wrote on the site will Robots Get Married? On how stuff works dot com? And stick around to find out how to get water from a beach if you're ever strained on a deserted island. Right after this stuff, you should know is brought to you by Visa. We all have things to think about, like say, what's the best site to buy a new leather jacket, or whether to buy the three or six megapixel camera. But thankfully we don't need to think about online fraud because for every purchase you make, Visa keeps an eye out for fraud with real time fraud monitoring and by making sure you're not liable for any unauthorized purchases. How's that for peace of mind? Safe, secure Visa way to stick around. It may save your life. So, Chuck, I'm going to tell these people. Already know you know how to do this because it's based on one of your articles. But I'm gonna tell everybody how to get water out of a beach on a deserted island. Right, it's called a beach. Well, yeah, and it can come in really handy if you're you know, like a castaway castaway, Yeah, exactly, go ahead and let him know I will. So basically, if you you find it sand dune right and uh, right behind it, you dig about a three to five ft hole that's deep, right or wide? Uh deep? Okay, three to five probably about a foot wide. Just you can reach down in there. If you can, you on a line the sides of the hole with wood to keep it from collapsing. You want to play some rocks in the in the bottom of it, right, and uh, you basically just walk away for a few hours. Right, you come back and presto, you've got about five gallons of pure water right there. Presto, Chango. It's not saltwater, you know, and you recommended in the article that it was. If it was a little salty, just move back a little further. And if you have a size twelve foot and you ever find yourself stranded on a desert island, just measure off a hundred feet and start digging there. That's what Chuck recommends. And drink out of your shoe. Yeah, that's a good one. Also, you can find a myriad other ways to save your own life, not only in Chuck's article how to find water in the wild, but on the adventure channel on how stuff works dot com for more on this and thousands of other topics.
