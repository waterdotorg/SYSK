Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Jerry's over there not paying attention, which means it's time for stuff you should know. She just loved that you like jerked. I'm totally paying attention. I've cooled you in my dreams before Dawn joke the life out of you. You know what a song I've been seeing in my head all day and researching this what stool Boom from Waiting for Guffman. We's here stool Boom. That's all I'll say. But there's more lyrics to it. Yeah, I mean the whole joke. Remember, And no, I've never seen that one. Boy, I know. I can't believe I haven't. Guffman, is that invest In show? To me? Your tied for first? Yeah? Um, I could watch those just about any time, even though you haven't seen one of them. If it's anything like Best In Show, I'm sure I can watch it, and I assume it's virtually the same movie. Yeah. The joke in Gouffment is it's the anniversary of the town of this very small town and they weren't, so they do a stage musical about the history of the town and the town was sort of founded on this one guy who invented the stool, So the town had a stool boom, and they have this big number called stool Boom, and you know, of course it's the play on the poop. Well, dude, stool is a word that sticks out to you when you're researching poop. It is a weird word to use, and it's got this definitely quasi medico smack to it. But at the same time, it's also got a droopy, dangly quality to it that makes it like super appropriate stool. Yeah, just the way it sounds. Yeah, it sounds like the sound that poop makes coming out of your rectum stool, you know. And everyone who just turned off by that, you better skip this episode because we're talking about poop, buddy, And if you can't handle it, go hide your head under your bed and pretend you don't do it. You can't handle the poop? Yeah, do you like that famous line movie records? Uh? Yeah, I mean we'll go ahead and give the warning. Surely you're not gonna sit down with your lunch and click on whatever you title this one, it's gonna be poop is going to be in the title What's the Deal with Poop? Yeah, so just you know, we're gonna talk about poop and what it looks like and smells like, and what it should look and smell like, and qualities and and uh properties of its consistency. It's gonna be uh medically disgusting. We're gonna be drowning and poop in this episode. Yeah, but it's important because you can learn a lot from your poop. Yeah, and you should not ignore your poop. You should, um maybe not every time, but you should check in on your poop and look at it. Okay, So there's a couple of things regarding that, because that definitelyly is recommended. We used the um impart of Mercola article and um like, there was a lot of encouragement to stop and turn around and look at your poop before you flush, you know, smell the roses. Stop and take the time to smell the roses. Right, this is sort of like that, but it's poop. But hold your breath. No, you should smell it. I guess you should a little bit. I think it's more if you hold your breath and can still smell it. Then there's a problem. But there's also such a thing I think is paying too much attention to your poop. Like after researching this, I was like, oh, man, am I just letting it go? Is this too hard? Is this straining? Like? What's the problem here? Like, I I feel like I'm freaking out a little bit. So I think there's a certain uh, there's a certain something to be said about just chilling out about your poop. But yeah, keeping an eye on it once in a while, because if I learned one thing from researching this, it's that if suddenly your poop starts falling out of its normal patterns, whatever that may be. I thought you're gonna say, starts like falling out of your ear right, that's a big problem. Or like South Park, remember they pooped out of their mouths. Yeah. There, by the way, there is such a thing as fecal vomiting. Okay, well let's just get to that right now. What is It's when you were so impacted compacted, which which which you would be impacted as well. Um, your poop is so backed up in your colon that you actually regurgitate back up. But it does not come up looking like a stool. It doesn't matter. Um, it's not like you're I mean, it's so gross. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I mean it's it's it's digestive fluids that are behind the poop mainly. So it's not like can I say tired if you want, I find that an unpleasant word, But some people are stool. It's not like a stool comes out of your body. You can say the T word if you want. So, really, how is it just not vomiting then, because it's directly related to the backup of feces. Yeah, well those the ones that were hanging on just to see they're gone. Now it's just you and me, Chuck and Jerry. So anyway, if you if you, if your poop suddenly takes a strange turn and it stays that way for a little while, then it's time to really start paying attention to your poop. Maybe call a doctor if we look into the whole thing. But I don't overthink your poop too much. Just keep an eye on it. Uh yeah, And and it's like you said, there is a tremendous amount to be learned from your poop. As a matter of fact, in two thousand fourteen, some archaeologists in Denmark and Odense, Denmark, which is where Hans Christian Andersen's from, discovered a latrine, a buried latrine of barrels and barrels and barrels of seven hundred year old Danish poop from the town. And you know what, it still smelled. Yeah, and there as as a matter of fact, because of that, they're a to really start to dig into this quite literally and find you know, a lot out about their diet, about them, the evolution of human gut microbial Yeah, which we're gonna get into. Um, and there's a lot you can tell from it to you don't have to go digging around Denmark to learn about your own poop. You just have to look through the toilet. So to know what to look for, it's best to understand, well, just what a healthy poops you know. Yeah, well, let's let's get a couple of stats out of the way. Um, the average Joe and Jane produces about ten thousand pounds of poop in a lifetime. It's like five times. Right. Where did you find that? The only place I can find it was uber Facts And then this article that this the article that you said I thought was pretty reputable. I did too, but I couldn't find anywhere else except uber facts. Right, Well, how about this, we'll just caveat that with two people. Say that you produced ten thousand pounds in a lifetime five five tons, and poop is made of well, it's made of about seventy water, fiber, undigested foods. Water. Uh, already said water, fats, cholesterol, salt, phosphates, sollar, waste, dead and live bacteria. Yeah, about is dead bacteria. So that's you know, it's nasty, that's all. It's a lot of bacteria. The nasty stuff is the live stuff that you're shedding because it's not supposed to be in there. M hm. You know. Poop comes in many sizes and shapes and colors. Uh, and we're gonna get into those in more detail. So there's this awesome, awesome thing called the Bristol stool Scale, and it is an illustrative guide to what healthy poop looks like. And it's type one through seven. Type one looks like little deer poops. Uh. They're they're characterized as separate hard lumps like nuts and then in parentheses hard to pass ass and then then in parent seas again you know what I mean. Type two, Uh, sausage shaped but lumpy. That looks sort of like a baby roof, baby Ruth, which is why I think they use that in the movie Caddy shack Um. Type three and types three, four, and five is you ne we're in the sweet spot? Yeah, that's that's the good range of where you want to be. And apparently four is is the best poop of all. Dr Murcola calls it the holy Grail of poops. Type four. The type three is uh like a sausage as well, but with cracks on the surface, So I guess the sausage is not very well made, all right, it's a rustic sausage. Type four is just uh, it's the smooth, consistent surface. It's like a snake between one and two inches in diameter up to eighteen inches long. I hear that in my head spins. Yeah, that's a big it's a big poop. Yeah. And I also read that, um, literally, the perfect stool is the perfect is a number four and S shaped number four. Yeah. And the reason why it's shaped that way is because it's um developed into that S shape in your intestines, right. Yeah. And my brother, my amazing brother. Oh, I'm sure it makes a cash registers sound. When he used to send me pictures of his poops because he was very famous for his long poops and um, post some of those. We should make a gallery. Well, i'll have to. I mean, this is before digital photography. He would take a photo of get it developed and mail it to me in college. Man, that Scott, and one of him was a beautiful, perfectly shaped s. And he was like, look, I put my initial and um. But now I know and I can tell him if he doesn't listen to this one. That dude, you had the whole the Unicorn of poops. The long s. Yeah, he t s two in diameter, perfectly consistent. Exterre was tapered at both ends. It was gorgeous. And the color also is very important. I'm just tittering like a child. A light brown color is really what you're looking for. I think most people understand what poop's supposed to look like, and the reason it has that light brown color is from Bilirubin's, which are from Paul Rubens, from Paul Rubens Paul Billy Rubens um which are it's a pigment that comes from the breakdown of um red blood cells in the liver, so it breaks it down. Get some bilirubens. That's what makes We'll talk about color more in a minute, but I just couldn't wait. Type five, you're still in the pretty good zone if you're if you have soft blobs with clear cut edges. Still it's caused to be like, I can do better than this. If it breaks apart on impact, you're like, I can do better, and I can tell you exactly what you need to do to do better. We'll get to it, fiber man. Sorry. Type six, um, this is when you're heading towards um bad news. Fluffy pieces of poop with ragged edges and mushy means you hungover, Yeah, quite possibly. And number seven finally, watery, entirely liquid, no solid whatsoever, a k A chuck on antibiotics, which I call poop pills, which I've said before on the show. And by the way, the Bristol stool scale, we should give props to Dr Stephen Lewis and Dr Ken Heating of the University of Bristol. Go fighting. Yeah, was when they first published that thing. And you can find those. You see him in doctor's offices, certain kinds of doctors. Sure, my house, do you have one? Is it just right in front of the toilet? It was okay, but you means like, um, so, chuck, you said fiber was a big deal, And we're gonna talk about fiber a little a little more depth later on. But if you do have stool that is not sticking together, and it's really it's really you can't get past it. All you have to do is up your intake of fiber. There's two kinds of fiber. There's soluble fiber, which actually is absorbed and it's that slows down your poop process and it allows more nutrients to be absorbed from food good stuff. Then there's insoluble fiber, which is what most people think of like fiber like grains and things like that, that actually isn't digested by you. It actually becomes food for the gut bacteria later on down the down the road, which is great, but you want to keep them alive. It also has the added benefit of bulking your poop up and acting like a sort of glue that keeps your poop together. You know that one long, perfectly smooth eighteen inch uh two inch diameter as shaped snake. Uh, if it is softer but not completely diarrhea like off serve ice cream. Uh. Maybe lactose intolerance, which is something I suffer from. Really yeah a little bit, not terribly, but you love ice cream? Yeah, I mean it only really hits me hard if I have like a lot of lactose in a single meal. Like if I have a lot of cheese, fight like a cheese pizza and top it off with an ice cream sunday, it's bad news. So I just don't do that, or I do and I know what's coming, but it just can't help myself. Or if you use artificial sweeteners that can cause your stools to be looser than normal, or if you have some sort of gluten gluten intolerance or celiac um that can hurt your make your poop looser as well and wreck all kinds of things in your body. We need to do one artificial sweeteners, man, Yeah, we should probably maybe revisit gluten. I know we did that one, but that was a while ago. Gets done? Is it done? Right? Have we ever done lactose intolerance? I don't. I don't think so now, really, I'm surprised we haven't done milk. There's a lot of cool stuff with that. Like, you know, there's different kinds of milk depending on where you are in the world, and they think that that has to do with lactose intolerance. Is like type A or type B milk. It's pretty interesting stuff. Yeah, And did you know that skim milk has an additional like chemical additive. It has a lot of high freak toast corn syrup in it. Yeah, because when you take that's the whole secret to low fat. That's why low fat stuff made everybody tubby and gave everyone diabetes, because when you take the fat out of stuff, there goes the taste too, So you have to bring some taste back with high freak toast corn syrup. That has nothing to do with the fat content. It just gives it some flavor. But it also is sugar added sugar. Yeah, there's also some other additive that you need. I don't drink a ton of milk anymore, but I started drinking whole milk again and it is so delicious. What is it doing to you if your lactose intolerant? How did you reintroduce milk into your diet. No, that's the thing. Like I can drink a glass of milk or eat a bowl of cereal or something. It doesn't wreck me or anything like it has to be a cheese pizza followed by a Sunday Yeah, just too much, you know, And a glass of milk isn't too much. I'm lactose. Um, I think semi intolerant. Or if you're an optimist, in the glass of milk is half full, your lactose semi toolerant. Yeah, there you go, we'll call you that. All right, Well, let's take a break here, you read my mind. Let's gather ourselves, and we're gonna come back and talk a little bit about, uh, the difference between healthy and unhealthy stools. All right, Josh, you want to talk what a good healthy stool looks like? Yeah, and by proxy, and unhealthy stool as well. So we go back and forth. No, I think we should go healthy unhealthy. Okay, that's that's how I think it'd be best. Alright, are you cool with that? I'm great with it. So healthy stool? Um, you already said medium to light brown. It's pretty good. Um. Different colors can mean different things. Uh, sometimes it's not a big deal. Like if you eight beats the night before you're pooping red, don't fret and think I have internal bleeding. It's just the beats. Have you seen that Portland you or they like dispatchers but they're like, did you have beats? And the person's like yes, They're like it's the beats, Like it's always the beats, yeah, no matter what it is. Like Jeff Goldboom gets in a car wreck and he's like, I need some help and he's like, I'm covered in red stuff and they're like it's beats and he looks and he's like, oh, I did run into a beat truck. How do you know that? And then they hang up on him and he's like, I still need help. That's a great one. I haven't seen that. Uh, or you know, like, um, I know from experience, too much red wine believe it or not, can cause uh, like black poop a little distressing. If you have black tari poop from what I read um where it's like literally sticky, you probably and it's this is this is something you've started to notice about your poop? It probably or it could mean that you're bleeding internally and it's not good. That's not good. All right, let's go back to healthy stools. Yeah, I thought that's what we're gonna do. Yeah, I met him to light brown, um, soft and smooth and not a lot of pieces. Like we mentioned that as shape is just amazing. If you can do that on a regular basis, should keep a little crown in your bathroom. Just don't dole it out all the time. You know, it's not a participant ribbon. I really want to save it for the right one. Uh. And listen up too, because here's something I didn't know. How the poop falls into the toilet, and whether it floats or not is a thing. So it says in't here the slightest, little gentle woosh, not a big cannonball splash like an Olympic diver going into a pool, a well executed dive, right, not one where they lean a little too far. No, no, like like just a yeah, yeah it's supposed to. Uh, And then I think the floating deal. If it floats, it may be that you're eating too much fat, which means could be a sign of malabsorption. Well, yeah, it could mean that you're eating a normal amount of fat, but your body is not absorbing it, and that could be a digestive issue or could be pancreat pancreatitis. It could be some problems again if it's not becoming evident yet. There's a lot of stuff, a lot of information you can glean from your poop. Yeah, and if floaters are fun and cute because you can poke them and play with them, right, but you really want a sinker? Do you still have that bathroom stick I got you for Christmas, the poking stick? Oh yeah, yeah, I thought that was a backscratcher. It's a boot poker. Yeah, for floaters. Well I could use it for both were eight right now? Oh boy? All right, unhealthy poop? Did we finish healthy? Ribbon like or pencil like? That's not good. That can be bad news. That could mean you have some sort of instruction, maybe a tumor sort of matching things together. And again, once in a while something happens like this. You don't need to go call nine wine, but just keep an eye on it. Yeah, because it's just the beats. That's what they would tell you. Right You covered a black and tari bright red is also not a good sign. It could be a medication. Apparently, black liquorice can cause black and tory poop. Yeah, if you're if you're eating black liquors though, your gross person, and you should stop that. I don't like any of that stuff, black or any like red vines and twizzlers. Uh, you don't like any liquors. Well, Emily loves which is the superior one? Twizzlers. I think it's the twizzlers she loves. She may think red vines are there's a lot of people that do a twizzler uh twizzler head. Okay, good for her, but um, I just I've never gotten it. I don't get it. Gummy bears and stuff, they just I don't like those. Those are like a totally different thing then in the texture kind of the same. No, no, not really, I don't like any of it. Chewy, I guess, but yeah, no, not really. Not a fan. You should try him. You should also try licorice and gummy bears next to each other so you can suss out the difference because they're not the same thing. Well, the point is I don't like either one. Uh No, So white pale or gray stools is no good. That may mean you have a lack of bile or a variety of diseases, from cirrhosis to hepatitis. Yeah, you want to be producing bile um. If you have white stool. It could also mean that somebody slipped you a little barry Um sulfate and gave you an X ray. Oh yeah, okay, So if you've drank barry Um self sulfate recently and you have white poop, it's probably not cause for alarm. They'll probably tell you that I would hope so, but just in case somebody got allowsy, medical provider, we're here to help you. Yellow is no good, right, yeah, Gilbert syndrome, which means that you're um. Your liver is not processing the bilirubins, so they're not breaking down and turning your poop brown. They're passing through intact and in dyeing your poop yellow. Gilbart Huh not Gilbert, Thank goodness for the Mayo clinic. Gilbert h Yellow stool could also be giardia or problems with your gallbladder, and then mucus chuck. So if you look closely at your especially if you open it up with your poking stick, you're gonna find that there's some mucus associated with it. Um a small amount of mucus is totally normal. You're intestines actually produced mucus um to coat your colon so that it helps smooth the stool through, right, Um, So of course your stool is going to be coated in a little bit of mucus. If you've noticed that all of a sudden, Um, it looks like someone snotted all over your poop. And this is a new development that is caused for concern because there are conditions where you you can overproduce mucus um and it can be a problem odor. Here's what to look for. All your poop is gonna sneak somewhat because poop. Yeah, bacteria chew on undigestive food and produce gases as a byproduct, and that creates the stinky poop smell. That's right. But apparently if it is really bad and they qualified quantified this as over above and beyond the normal stinky poop smell, if it could make a billy go puke very nice first blood reference, Um, it could be some other issues at play if it's really that bad. Malabsorption again, celiac crones, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis. Yeah, and I don't you know. I guess that's subjective. I think the key and all of this that I've read is look for big changes. So that's the key. Yeah. If if your poop is normally just pretty stinky, and then all of a sudden you are revolting yourself, then you could have something else going on. Or if your pet billy goat is just throwing up everywhere every time you go, that's a that's a big change too. And again, you yourself, you have your own pooping rhythm, you have your own pooping thing, and a lot of people wonder how often are you supposed to poop, and apparently it's a very wide range, anywhere from three times a week, who three times a day? So I think that that washes out which one about three times a day? Okay, that's yeah, I don't I don't have normal. But then again, if you said three times a week, that'd be normal too. Yeah. I've never had issues with getting backed up and having troubles, which it's thank goodness, terrible, you know, I think, Well, never mind, so I won't reveal too much about my family. All of that washes out to about once a day on average, But that's kind of a. Um, that's a that's a terrible thing to average out because it makes people think, well, I do it three times a day or I do it three times a week, So really anywhere between there is normal. Yeah, and different things can cause you to get backed up. Um, if you're traveling a lot sometimes Uh, it hadn't happened to me, but I've seen it before on vacations. Um when uh, you know, beloved family members have trouble pooping while they travel. Um. Whether that's from being in a different you know, not wanting to poop in like a public restroom. That's part of it. To just changes in your diet and your circadian rhythm because of jet light, absolutely, hormonal fluctuations, how much sleep you're getting. Um, what else if you're sick right, Um, all those things can add up. And apparently age has a lot to do with it as well. If you are sixty five and over something like people over sixty five have some sort of um constipation, it's just part of growing old, they think. Um, which sucks because if you can go three times a day and you're snapping while you do, you're a lot happier than if you are over sixty five and constipated. There's a lot of problems with constipation. Initially, there's just the problem of straining when you go, which is not fun. Um. There is not feeling like you have fully eliminated everything that needs to go. Apparently you can feel sluggish after you go. It's weird. There's that defecation sink peh I said correctly this time. UM. And then there's larger, larger problems like after a while, your your digestive system is okay to hold about a week's worth of food at one time if it needs to, it doesn't want to, you can um. Once you go beyond that, or even if um, you are eliminating but not eliminating everything, it starts to build up and you're constipated. You can have an impacted colon, and then the real joy begins. Yes and me pain. Yeah. They they will go in with a mineral oil and I'm gonna start. That doesn't work, they may go in and manually break up your poop, which is exactly what it sounds like. Thank you for demonstrating that with your hand. You're very welcome. Uh. And then if that doesn't work, they may surgically remove the poop. From your your digestive syste man, it's not good not poop. We're gonna talk about some ways to help yourself. If you're one of those people who poops less than you'd like to, or you find yourself constipated a lot, we're gonna help you out right after this, alright. Uh. It takes about um between eighteen and seventy two hours for your food to become poop and for you to pass it in general. Uh. And if that's shortened, that's when you're going to get the diarrhea because that means your intestines hasn't uh didn't have enough time to absorb the water to make that poop more dense. Yeah, And we talked a lot about that in the The Digestive System episode, which was great. Yeah. We also did one in fecal transplants. Yeah, but we haven't still, in my opinion, focused enough on just the poop, which is why we're doing this one. Thank you. We need a poop spotlight. Uh. And then constipation is the opposite that has when too much water has been absorbed, and that's that those hard uh hard stools and hard to pass stools, which you can lead to uh to Uh, hemorrhoids. It can so. Um. Hemorrhoids is the result of swollen veins in your anus and wreckthum. Not awesome at all. No, I had them bad once. It's no fun so and it can be very painful. Uh. And it makes you not want to go because you have to strain. It's like a vicious circle, right, Like you have to strain, but it hurts to strain because it makes your hemorrhoids worse. And then you um don't want to go at all, so you avoid going, which is a cardinal sin as far as staying regular goes. When you get the urge to go, you go. You don't hold it. It doesn't matter if you're a truck stop or uh at the Queen of England's house, you go. I would love to poop there, right So. Um. The hemorrhoids will eventually clear up with treatment especially but um, it's it's a it's a part of the problem with being constipated, as you can very easily get hemorrhoids. Yeah. The key is really tried and not strain even though you really want to get the poop out is just gonna make it all worse. Um. So that's easier said than done. Sugar, Like, what do you do if you are constipated or you don't poop as often as you'd like to. What are some of the fixes for that. Well, they don't advise you to run out and start using laxatives immediately. Uh, that's sort of a last resort home remedy, which is crazy because laxatives are marketed in a way that makes it seem like you have trouble poop, take a laxative, will be fine, And that's actually they're They're supposed to be a last resort option, like a nuclear option basically, because well, the they they train your the muscles in your intestines to rely on them and to basically get weak, and you need to keep those things strong. Yes, uh more tipsy eat whole foods. We're talking fresh veggies, fresh fruits. Um, fiber is I mean you should have I think an adult I think they recommend now between twenty five and thirty five grams of fiber per day. Yeah, but we're getting like ten yea and Miracola suggests fifty grams of fiber per thousand calories we consume a day. Yeah, that's a lot. Yeah, that guy's got cold and blow. Do you remember that saturright Live commercial? Yeah, that's a classic. Um. So the fiber you want should come from not grains, but from vegetables. Um. Like we mentioned those artificial sweeteners. Too much sugar MSG, too much caffeine, and too much processed food that can all reek havoc on your system. Uh. And this is all just good for just health and digestive health in general. Exactly. You know, Um, did you say exercise? Not yet? That's a big one. Exercise not only gets things moving, it also um. Usually when you exercise, one of the things you're doing is working on your core, whether you mean to or not, kind of the center of all of the rest of the muscles you're moving. And when you're working on your core, you're inadvertently strengthening those intestinal muscles that help that choreograph dance of moving your food into your poop and along and out of your poop shot is what it's called. Uh, staying hydrated. If you're not drinking um enough water, that's not gonna do any favors in the poop department. Um. If you are addicted to pain killers, one of the awful side effects, aside from being addicted to a drug, is you're gonna have a real hard time pooping. Yeah, because it relaxes those muscles too. Yeah, they need that help, they sure do. They're they're out there wearing sunglasses, laying on a chaise lounge at like two in the afternoon, like the rest of your body when you're on those things. Uh, and then you look at the let's talk a little bit about the toilet, the shape of the modern toilet. By the way, Strickland and I did a tech stuff on toilets that was really fascinating. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's counterintuitive to how your body should be positioned to poop. You should not. We did not evolve to poop sitting at a ninety degree angle as if on a chair. Um. I've said it before on the show. When I go camping, you go out in the woods, you know, you walk a little bit away from where your friends are at least three or four at least three or four. You squat down, And that's the most natural way to poop. It's effortless. It comes right out there's you don't even think about pushing or straining. It just it. I believe what it does, doesn't It straightened out the path way, so it relaxes your pubo wreck talus muscle, which, yeah, which straightens out your your calling which basically says stool release right there on the leaves. It's wonderful. And well, do you remember when we were talking about India's like defication problem like outdoor defication problems on Internet roundup years back, and they were saying one of the big things they were running up against is that people who live in rural areas say this is one of the benefits of wholesome rural living. It's getting to poop outside. Man, get off my back. I can understand where they're coming from. Yeah, So there are are things you can add to your toilets. Now, um, a little um to raise your feet stools, Yeah, ironically little footstools. Uh, not to buzz market too much, but I know the squatty potty is something that it's neatly in front of your toilet and basically it just gets you more in that squatted position than you are normally on your toilet. And this used to be the domain of strictly the Whole Earth Catalog or something like that. But you can find those things that like bed bath and beyond. Now, yeah, I think people are kind of catching on. It's it's a better, a better way to poop. Yeah, so you can still use your toilet, you know, the squat it just it does the squatting for you by lifting up your legs. It's like you're giving birth basically, it's still no substitution for actually squatting right on the ground, which I mean in Japan they have toilets that are made for squatting exclusively. Oh, it's it's just like a hole in the floor. It's kind of like it's it's a lot like a urinal on the ground. Interesting. Yeah, so it's not it's not, uh, vertically oriented, it's horizontally oriented, but it's it looks just like a urinal. So when you go to like an old city park and the kernal has fallen off onto the ground and needs squatt and poop in that, Japan, it's the same thing, right, all right, it's a kind of like that. Imagine that. But the cleanest experience you could ever imagine. Even even their squatting toilets are clean in Japan, I believe it's uh. And here's a little tip if you want to avoid hemorrhoids, or if you just want to live a cleaner, more sanitary life, get a bid day. I know, I talked about it when I installed my little unit. They can you know they have them, Well, you can attach them to your regular toilet now. Yeah, it's just like with like a TA line or something off of your water so yeah, and it sits under your toilet seat and it's uh, spring loaded, so when you turn the water on, this little nozzle pops out right up your right up your butt. And um, I've long campaigned against toilet paper, and now that I have a baby, it's even more apparent. It's just it makes no sense to me that you have a baby and you're like, well, yeah, you use wet wipes because that's how you should clean poop. And then you get to a certain age you're like, all right, let's just go with dry paper now, like forget the superior wet method. Well, the thing is, it just doesn't make any sense. Why would you move to dry wipe feces from your butt with a dry piece of paper. Like, I understand what you're saying, it's nonsensical, but our sewer systems in the United States are not set up to accept wet wipes. Well that's why you have the bidet. Okay, no wipes, I mean dab dabit dry with a couple of squares. But I'm telling you it'll change your life. It's it's amazing. I have a feeling the people with bid days are going to be the first with their backs up against the wall when like resource conflicts breakout over water throughout the world. They'll be like, you're doing what with that water? Do use toilet paper? Well that's what they say. If that happens and it's not a ton of water, you'll turn it off, but you'll be crying, shutting it tear goodbye by day. See you in a hundred and fifty years. Uh, where are you? What else we got? We're pretty far off. Oh the microbiome. We should talk about that. And we did a great podcast on the microbiome, if we do say so ourselves. Yeah, it was a good one. And um. What they have found is that the modern diet, where you're not eating nearly as much fiber as you should and you're eating more processed foods, is not only just impacting your short term digestive uh, degrading your short term digestive health, but it's affecting your microbiome, which you know, if you listen, could also affect your children and your children's children's. That was another good one. Can your grandfather's diet shorten your life? So fiber is great, it's hard to digest um so it doesn't break down fully, and that's what you want when it's going through your colon because, like you said earlier, the bacteria feeds on that, and you want to keep that bacteria alive because it's great for you. This is a Mental Floss article that we were working off of, right, I think. So they were talking about a study from Stanford that found that they can they've created mice that are are microbe free, which is beyond bizarre. I don't understand how they stay alive for even a second. But then they fed these these two populations of mice both MicroB free UM high fiber diet and the same diet with low fiber and no fiber I think, and they found that UM the with the microbes in the mice that had a high fiber diet, they had like three times more UM diversity in their microbiome than the what the other mice developed yeah, I think, uh, you to mention they were microbe free and then they put human microbes in there. So it's so then the human microbiome was reduced by in the mice with the low fiber diet, and if they if they change that diet after a number of weeks, it could partially recover, but only partially. It can never fully recover. Yeah, so the upset they did say poop transplants are a viable way of taking uh, microbial colonies and and like diverse microbial colonies from a healthy person and putting them in an unhealthy person, right, and then you can get it all back. But the point of this was is that like our diet is largely based on a almost a fiber free model, Like we eat very little fruits and vegetables, and apparently we're supposed to be eating something like ten to twenty cups of of fruits and vegetables of high fiber um foods a day, ten to twenty cups. When's the last time you ate twenty cups of fruit and vegetables in a day? So, right, and exactly, And then the even the other stuff that the bad type of fibers stuff we get from grains, the grains that were eating have most of the fiber removed, Like bleached flower has virtually no fiber in it, So we're not getting a lot of fiber. And it's becoming increasingly apparent that not only do we need it so we can better our microbiomes, needed so they can make us better. Serotonin, higher quality serotonine is what you're looking for. Yeah, there's a big push for um against white foods um, white flower, just you know, apparently most white things, white sugar not great for you. You wanted to cover some of these weapons, I really mainly just wanted to talk about the guy in Northern Canada, Oh, the Inuit. Yeah, all right, well quickly, this is from Vice, and there was a list of history Brown Death calling a history of poop as a weapon, and they list out some times throughout history where people have like put poop on the end of their arrows or literally launched poops in a like a poop exploding poop bomb to make people sick and uh infected poop. The Soviets had a method of getting rid of poop in a tank. Basically, you know, when you're in the tank and you're going along, you got a poop, so they said, well, let's just turn it into a weapon. Yeah, pooping the artillery and launch it out. But this one about an Inuit man who lived in the nineteen fifties. Apparently he appeared in a TED talk by Wade Davis and he was the guy who did the Serpent in the Rainbow. Okay, I knew the name. It's amazing. Um. He said that this guy was basically left by some Canadians to starve to death in Arctic Bay right in northern Canada. Apparently in the nineteen fifties, Canada forced Inuite people into settlement camps way in the High Arctic zone and it was basically like here's a couple of dogs, good luck dying, and that was it. That Inuit all there was like, I'm going to survive this one. It's not my first rodeo because I'm going to you know how, it's super cold outside. I'm gonna go outside and poop, and as my poop freezes, I'm gonna fashion it into a knife and then your face is going to be red because I'm gonna use that knife to kill one of these dogs and use it for meat. Yeah, that that part made me sad, of course, but it was for survival. And I think we didn't mention that they took all of his duels um away from him, so he didn't have the knife, right. He just had himself, his poop and the two dogs until he fashioned his own poop knife frozen poop knife. Yeah, and he butchered one of the dogs, used it for food for him and the other dog, and basically turned that dog into a sled, use the other dog to pull said sled, and high tailed it down to saying antone. I was waiting for the end when he like then stabbed members of Canada's government with poop with the poop knife. But that didn't happen. Uh. He didn't have any sour grapes. He just said it is what it is. I'm just glad I got out and frozen poop Knife is not a good band name. Um, And I feel bad for saying this because I love these guys. But there's a band end called Diarrhea Planet that are great. What do they sound like, Oh, it's just a wall of guitar. They've got like four guitar players. Uh, and it's just really good. But it's the worst name ever. And I don't know why someone hasn't said, guys, just do yourself a favor, like you're not helping yourselves here in your career by calling yourself diarrhea planet. So that just if you're listening, guys, change it to frozen poop knife and thank me later. Ah. I want to say before we sign off, you've got anything else? Nope, I want to say, Um, I want to hear your euphemisms for poop, for pooping, like dropping a deuce? Yeah, something like that. You've got any clever ones that I haven't heard before? Love to hear them. Yeah, yeah, I've always thought it take it dump was weird? You're leaving a dump? Yeah, but even still this is gross? Yet, what do you say? That's what you say? I'm going to evacuate my bowels. You've heard me say that before. I think I have actually, um, yeah, very medical. While you're sending us those, go ahead and go on over to how stuff works dot com and type in uh poop in the search bar and it'll bring up some cool stuff. Uh. And since I said poop, it's time for a listener, mate. I'm gonna call this um listener mail. The Josh picked out. Hey, guys, started listening to you a couple of years ago. Since then, I'm blown through almost every episode. The reason to say almost is because I didn't keep track of which episodes I listened to from the beginning, so I constantly have to go through all the old episodes to figure out which ones I already heard which ones I hadn't. The reason I mentioned this is because I noticed something. What he started doing is keeping track basically, and he said I noticed something curious is to start listening to only new episodes almost exactly the next day after a new show. I noticed that whatever topic you covered has made its way to me in some other form. Usually this comes in the form of a Reddit post or a Mashable, uh in Gadget or gives Moto article the latest such currencies from your episode on cryotherapy. Go to end Gadget, you will find that today there was a post talking about the subject. Article covers exactly what you two had already covered. I call this the Chuck and Josh effect. Yeah, and usually barrate my wife about how I just listen to you to talk about the subject. I'm sure it's been happening for quite a while, but It's always fun to see new articles pop up from subjects you just covered. You have a big influence on the interwebs and what information gets passed around. I don't know if it's due to us or coincidence. I coincidence. We're inspiring. I had tickets to see you in New York City last time you're here, but unfortunately if beloved dog Henry passed away that day. Sorry, I'm sorry to hear that dead. I hope you two are planning to make another trip out east. It's not out east, it's north. What's up north? Out west? Back east and down south? Oh yeah, back east, wagons east. But if you live down south and you're going east, you don't say I'm going You say you're going up. Nor yeah, you go up, you go east, you end up in the ocean. And just because we don't hear Jerry doesn't mean she shouldn't get recognition for the work she does there. Jerry gets enough recognition. Hope to see you on the next door. That is Ted Wheeler and Ted uh. We read this in the poop article. So I don't know how this is going to touch your life personally, but you can't wait to hear ted he just said poop article and touch your life personally. May all your poops be brown S's and Jerry way to go, man. Uh. If you want to get in touch of this, you can tweet to us that s y s K podcast.
