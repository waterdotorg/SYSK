Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you should know front House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles w Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry Uh. Yeah, it's stuff you should know. He just shrugged, like, what are we gonna do? That's what we are episode number seven something. Yeah, I have no idea either. It's in the seven hundreds of folks. If you think there's only three hundred because you're on iTunes, you're in for to be doubly surprised. Yeah. Well, somebody um tweeted recently, I've just found the How Stuff Works app and there's way more stuff you should notice than there is on iTunes. I hate you guys now. Wait, I was cool with three one, but that's it. I had someone asking it the other day if we feel like we're running out of things topics, clearly we are because we're recording on your way exactly. What did you tell him look for boogers in the near future? Um no, I said no that sometimes it feels a little like, oh my gosh, what are we gonna do? But there's gazillions of topics in the world at least, and gazillions of scientific that's right. What is that? How many zeros? Is that a real number? I don't know. I don't think it is. Let's say nine, it's a real number if you're eight years old, but watch it probably is a real number. Yeah, I think, Um, a jillian is a real number. A bazillion jillian definitely is. I would guess gazillion is by now I might actually look that up. I mean, there's just like a handful of mathematicians who are in charge of naming that kind of stuff, you know. So, chuckers, while you're looking that up, do you have ear wax? Um? Do you have a problem you're wax? None? No, I don't either. No, I wouldn't say so. Um. It is a little distressing, though, even though we will find out it is awesome and exactly how it's supposed to work. When it just sort of falls out of your ear onto your shoulder. Yeah, that's that's ideal. Actually, yeah, because ear wax in your physiology in general doesn't care about what social group you're a part of. Nope, it's just like, here's some ear wax on your shoulder. Deal with it. Although and I didn't look up why this is true? Apparently in northeastern Asian countries like Korea and China, um they they're ear wax is a little different. They're more likely to have the dry ear wax UM, which can be hard and red to black in color, which sounds gross and flaky or pale yellow, whereas here we have that um, nasty, gooey orange e mess wet ear wax. That is what it's called. Yes, and the reason why actually is because of the ABC living gene. That why, Yeah, they isolated the gene that there was a reason causes the type of ear wax that you get. And it turns out that they say the w UM mutation is um or the D mutation dry ear wax is recessive. So the only way to get dry ear waxes if both of your parents have dry ear wax, both carry the D gene or D mutation of the ABC levan gene. Well, I have both. Most people have our w D sea. So you have to get to D alleles to dry ear wax alleles to have dry ear wax yourself. If you have a W in a D or two W you're gonna have wet And for some reason I have both. Can't you like one ear is dry and the other's wet. No, like sometimes you know, if I get the old cotton swab out, which now you're introducing something way beyond genetics. That's not even apo genetics, that's human intervention. The point is, if I get the cotton swab out, that's when I'll get out the orange wet stuff. But um, I'll also have the dry, flaky stuff that falls out sometimes probably, I would guess. And I'm no ceremon expert, I'm no seaminisd. Now what's the what's the word? Uh? Actually looked it up for someone who studies this. It has to have to do with ceremon m. I can't find it now. It's so Seamonius doesn't ringing a bell. No, it's wrong. I can't find what it is. Sorry, Okay, Well the person who said, I'm not a person who studies ear wax. But what I would guess is that when you're when you're digging in there, you're getting to the fresher ear wax, That's what I think. And then as it works itself further and further out your ear, which is the natural process, it's exposed to drier air, that ambient air, and it drives out and flakes off, which is what it's supposed to do. So I don't think you have both. I think if you have both, the stuff inside your ear would be dry, would be dry as well. Yeah, okay, all right, well that makes sense. Um, So what ear waxes or uh ceramon c E R U M E N is the scientific name, but I'm sure they call it wax. It's the third chubby angel. Now, that's cerebum um. It is made up of secretions of a couple of little specialized glands uh in the skin on the outer third of the ear canal. Yes, um, so you have your sebaceous glands and they're gonna secrete in these names all sounds so growth really, but they're perfect for describing what they are. Yeah, yeah, um, they secrete sebum as E V m uh. And then you have um an apocrene sweat gland that's modified that produces uh yeah, it combines, it combines with the sebum, and that's where you get your ceremony. And so see them in and of itself is fairly normal. If you like, take your fingertip and rub it alongside where your nose folds into your face. That's well if if your stuff is at all oily, the oil is see them. So apparently it mixes in in your ear with the the that kind of apicrene gland like you said, to form ceramon, which is its own thing. It's not just see them, but all of it is basically fatty, oily lipid e um compound that's secreted by these glands in the skin cells, specialized glands. Yeah, about six keratin, which is a protein. And then like you said, the fatty acids, you've got dead skin cells, um, hair follicles, dead bugs, little bugs. Yeah, lots of stuff that comes out in this and like you, like you said dust it probably dust mites then too. And like you said, um, it's produced in the inner third of the outer ear outer one third of the ear canal um. And when it's produced in there, it's migrates outward thanks to um the motion of the ocean. Right and you talking and chewing. Yeah, I couldn't figure out, like how does your ear wax move, But it's just from jaw movement. Normal jaw movement moves the old or the newer stuff outward and as it's coming out, all the gunk and stuff that's protected your ear from are moved out with it. So the stuff that flakes off and falls on your shoulder, Uh, that everybody points and laughs at at the at the party, Um, that is filled with all the stuff that your ear reax caught along the way. It's a it's a beautiful, elegant process. Probably was beautiful, um, aspect of the entire human experience. Well, I think you're making a joke, but I really do think that. Like it's the little things like that about Like I'm amazed about the function of the brain and of course the organs and all that, but just something as simple as that mechanical talking and chewing will work ear wax out of your ear. It's just so basic, and I think it's awesome and I think it's really cool. Actually, I know. To me, I agree with you. Um. So some people produce a lot of this. Um. I was gonna say gross stuff. But have you seen Paddington the movie? Yeah? No, I heard it was really good. It's very good, super super cute, really well done. Why did you see that? Just because it's a cute movie? Really yeah? Um, solid in theaters and everything. UM, please tell me you took you me yeah. And as a matter of fact, it was just me and you, me and the whole theater. But if it's just you and no kids, then it's like somebody you might want to call that they did. I'm just a Paddington fan, um, but I am now So anyway, Um, there is a part where there's a part featuring ear wax in Paddington. It's it does not celebrate the beau of ear wax. It's the exact opposite. And actually you mean was like god or it was really gross but just awesome. So anyway, Gussie Gussie Paddington. Is that a spoiler? Okay, I don't think so, maybe for like a five year old you know. Um, So, like I said, some people produce a lot of the stuff. Um, some people don't produce as much, and they don't really know why, but they do know that sometimes stress and anxiety, um can increase production of your wax, which makes interesting hormones, hormones affected your glands go off. It also said that some drugs can increase your ear wax production. And I looked all over and can you find the drugs? But if stress and anxiety does hiahuasca, I imagine yeah, or cocaine would probably make you produce more ear wax or something. Oh yeah, when you put that stuff in your ear, yeah, or something that makes you like to your jaw lot. Oh sure, that could probably get more ear wax out. Yeah. Interesting, I never thought about that. I couldn't find any anything else. Um is gross, as you might think ear wax as though it actually is a great thing for your body. And there's a very good reason, uh why you have it, because there are four main functions that your ear wax is going to serve my friend. Uh. One of them is it creates an acidic environment. That's great, that kills helps kill bacteria and fun Guy. Oh even better, number two, Um it is, Well, that's that's a big deal too, because your ear, your inner ear, like that is really a place where fungus and bacteria would thrive because it's moist and dark, and you know what we always say about moist dark places, fun Guy thrives, that's right. Um. The thing is is, it doesn't seem like that be a big problem to have fun Guy in your ear, but it would because it would affect things like your balance, nausea, ear aches. Um, it just wouldn't be good so the fact that earwax produces in a cidic environment alone makes earwax a beautiful thing and to be celebrated. So if we did, we could just stop there. We could, but you can go on. Like you said, there's four and that was just one quarter of these these benefits that your ex pistos. Secondly, it is a lube. Um. It lubricates your ear can basically to keep it from drying out. And um, you know you don't want the inner ear becoming all like itchy and dry and craggedy, and you want to hear something weird that I've a new personal hygiene thing I have to do as of yesterday, starting yesterday, something I'll probably have to do my whole I have to moisturize not ears. Now. I thought you gonna say, heir inside the ear. I was like, I have been doing that for a while. It's getting I got a little fro inside ear fro yeah, but no, like taking moisturizer and like rubbing on my ears because I got a haircat yesterday and like my ears were exposed and all of a sudden, I'm like, wait, why is like there a streak of white on my ear? And they're bright red, and I realized, like, my ears are chapped, and that is brand new or else. I just noticed it. So I'm an ear moisturizer. Now, yeah, you had that seventies uh ear muff hairstyle cut off of your ears so your ears were exposed. Yeah, it was pretty seventies, wasn't well. I was growing my hair out to to create like a blank slate of you know that could be worked with. It was kind of longish for you. It was really long and it it was that seventies like ear muff thing wasn't quite It was getting there. It looks good, very nice. Thanks. Did that make you uncomfortable? No, I was fishing for that the whole reason I brought that story. You looked either sheepish or really uncomfortable with a little bit both. Alright, gotcha? Alright. Number three on top four things that earwax does, Uh is your ceremon and your hair just like let him exactly. Um, it's gonna discover just uh everyone's worst nightmare, which is spider crawling in there, which I covered. Uh, you know that happened to Emily. I think I talked about that on one of the shows that was genuinely one of the most awesome things that I've ever experienced, because it did not happen to me. Wasn't there a picture? Didn't you post a picture of it or something like that? Um No, but there I think I I posted a picture of a happening to some woman in China. I think that was frightening, And it was a picture of a spider looking out of the woman's ear canal right, yeah? Yeah, but Emily's if people haven't heard this story, it was I think it was in the middle of the night or something. She was like, I got this weird fluttering in my ear and I don't know what's going on in there. And I was like, well, you know, I took in the bathroom and trying to light and I was like, holy crap. And the spider I think work. Didn't it with the flash flight? Remember like, if you look at your I don't know, did the did They're saying yes, yes, okay, so there you go. Well, all I remember thinking is only I don't want to have to break this to you, but you have a spider in your ear? You didn't like chloroformer first? I should have. Yeah, she was not excited about that. She was not pumped, but so, well, what was the process for getting it out? Well, I've looked on the internet super quickly, um to see how and they said to flush it out and um, just like a little warm. Oh my gosh, you did use tweezers. Yeah, And I put the water in there and it kind of um loosened it up, and went in there and got the tweezers and I was like, look at this. How big was it? Oh? I mean it wasn't huge, but it was It was enough spider for her taste. Yeah, more than enough, right, dude, it was. I can't imagine that some people like sleep with vesseline in their ears to keep bugs from crawling in. Yeah, like that is a thing. Yeah, I mean people don't want bugs in their ears. No, but that's taken. I mean that's just parents severe paranois. I think if you're sleeping that your muffs are vesselly in your ears, you know, your moss. I thought about that, you all right? And number four finally is um, your ear wax is gonna trap some dead skin and hair cells and basically all of that junk to carry it back out to keep it clean. So it sounds sort of counterintuitive to trap that stuff, but it's trapping it so it can carry it out. And if you didn't have your wax, it would just go in there, right, And if you chew things like celery and you talk, then that your wax is going to work its way out in a slow process where all this stuff is cleaned out and you don't ever have to do anything with it under ideal circumstances. Not always are circumstances ideal, And we'll talk about how things can go wrong after this, Okay, Chuck's so ideally you don't have to ever think about ear wax or anything like that to brush it off your shoulder, right. But um, for some people, ear wax can build up and become impacted, a lot of times it's because people mess with it, like with cotton swabs on a stick. You know, you may have seen the advertisement on the Big Game. You're just called cotton swabs, right, yeah, okay, Um, so when uh, if you use that, a lot of people use those to clear out their ear wax. Right, you're supposed to know it's doing the exact opposite, because your ear wax is um created and moves from the outside third of your inner ear um. When you rub cotton swab on it, you're actually pushing it in further than it's supposed to be and it it can't get out is easily there. So what you're going to do eventually is have ear wax build up. Yeah, And it's it's so hard to get people to not do that because is it's so um rewarding when you get out of the shower and use that swab and you get that orange kunk and you're like, oh man, I'm so glad that's out of my body. But it's it's got a purpose. Leave it there. You're supposed to leave it there. Plus there's I mean, using cotton swabs can lead to other kinds of dangers, like you can push too hard and prefer your ear drums. I think it really is true. You're not supposed to put anything larger than the end of a football in your ear um. You can also clean it too much. It can result in something called swimmers ear. We're basically for people who spend a lot of time in pool. Their ears are constantly irrigated and the canal becomes basically free of um of ear wax, and as a result, bad things can happen. Yeah, And they say, if you do have swimmers, ere um, put a few drops of an acidic slightly acidic, not acid like hydrochloricas. Let's put a gallon drome. What is a slightly acidic fluid? I wonder, Uh, lady, lemon juice, that's what I would guess, That's probably what I would do. I hope we're not advising something that's really nat. No. As a matter of fact, maybe you should go look up what you should put in there or go to your doctor. Yes, but they advised some slightly acidic fluid in the ear after you swim, and that established re establishes what should be a normal acidic environment. Yeah, because you when you strip out that ear wax, you lose those big four benefits and all of a sudden, your ear is dry and cracky, and you've got fungus and bacteria growing in there, and you get ear infections and it's not fun. The big four um you and back to creating a build up of ear wax, you get what's called ceramon impaction, and that is when like you have a bunch of ear wax pressed against your ear drum and it can result in all sorts of stuff like headaches, nausea, ear aches, coughing for some reason. Um, and that can be from using Q tips. People who use hearing aids run into this a lot. Uh. And when your ceremony becomes impacted, you have to go to the doctor. That's right. Which my sweet wife had to go to the doctor when she was a little girl because ear wax impaction. Yeah, and uh she said it sucked. Well, when you go to the doctor if it comes to that, Um, they're gonna have quite a few techniques that could use. Um, you're syringing is one of them. And then comes painful. It does. I don't think it is, though. I bet it's actually quite a relief. Yeah, that's not how I hear it. Really is it painful? Yeah? Umi says it really is not fun. Well, I didn't know if that was like a five year old Umi or well yeah, yeah, but even as an adult she remembers it as not being very fun. Is Paddington Jumi? Maybe that's why she had such a reaction. Maybe, Um, they'll use other instruments. Sometimes you use a microphone or I'm sorry, a microscope. That'd be weird to magn to find the ear canal. They shout into it to shatter your ear ax. Um, and some people have a more narrow ear canal, or if you have a perforated ear drum or something that can be a problem. Um. Basically you want to go to a doctor. You could try some home methods like peroxide or maybe mineral oil. Yeah, apparently warm mineral oil kind of breaks it up a little bit. Yeah, I used to. That's one of my most pleasing memories as a kid when I had ear aches, as my mom would like heat up mineral oil and put in my arrows. But that was nice, felt really nice. It's very warm. And when for some reason, I like the feeling of water closing my ear, like when I get into a pool. Oh yeah, I'll but probably because of that. Yeah maybe, so I didn't think about that. Do you like that or what? I just you just like crawling into the field. Why is Chuck just floating in the pool like a baby? Um? I no, I've never had much of an affinity for water in my ears because some people hate it. I don't hate it. I don't like it. Yeah, And like you know, I'll bang on the side of my head if it feels like there's like a drop of water in there. Does that work? Uh? It can not always. I think normally the water just has to dry. Sometimes I get dizzy in my head, hurt. I used to see when I lifeguarded. I would see swim team members do that though, and I was always like, I don't know if that just doesn't seem right. Once in a while it does and it just goes and all of a sudden you can hear normally. Again. Interesting. I didn't see the reason for this though, but they did. Um in this one article I saw have caution people against ear irrigation if you had diabetes. What? Yeah? Why? I have no idea. I meant to follow up on that. So we don't know what drugs cause an increase in ear wax build up, and we don't know why if you have diabetes you shouldn't do ear can irrigation. I don't know. They said not to use irrigation if you have a perforated ear drum. Yeah, I get that tube in the ear drum A weekend immune system or diabetes. Huh, have no idea. I don't have to follow up on social media and let people know. Um, But they do say if you do want to clean your ear. It's not like you can't clean your ears, but just wash your external ear with a cloth. But you should never stick something into your ear canal right, it's just no good. But it's interesting that the cotton swab businesses huge. I mean, they've made a if you think about it, they made I don't want to say it's they shouldn't be selling these things now, I know what you mean, though, you know. Yeah, apparently that I couldn't find out how much um people spend on cotton swabs every year or how many are produced. We couldn't find out that either. But for two thousand eleven, apparently Americans spent sixty three million dollars on ear cleaning stuff, home ear cleaning stuff, and I am doing a lot of that went to cotton swabs, but also like home irrigation kits and stuff like that. Yeah, because you can get those at the drug store, right, and those are fine? I guess, yeah, I don't know. I mean, everything is upside down right now. Well, no, I think the irrigation is fine if you don't fall into one of those categories that I mentioned, because you're not sticking an object into your ear. That and then if you don't do it too frequently to where you're stripping the ear wax out of your ear right, because it's not like that thing just replenishes overnight. Guys, I know, and you know I used the cotton swabs, not a lot, but occasionally. But I'm not gonna do it anymore. But it is, like I said, it's it feels so good to get a big hunk of that stuff out. Yeah, I've never been into those. Ye, I'm not gonna do it anymore. I'm gonna tell the only two. I'm gonna burn all that stuff. All I do is I take some soap and lather at my hands, do the outside of my ears, and then, like I guess, I just kind of follow the contours the inside of my ears. And I'm trying to remember, like do I go into my ear canals? And I think I intuitively stop with your fingers, yeah, and about the outside, so I don't really go into the ear canal and then rinse it out and get off and get out of the shower. And then now I, um, I moisturized my ears afterward, is the last step. That's great. Um. The other thing too, that they of course you should never ever do. Like cotton swabs is one thing, but like a car key or bobby pin or like a toothpick, what is wrong with you? I don't know that you should never ever stick something like that in your ear because you're just asking for trouble, big trouble. Um. All right, Well, after this break we are going to talk about you're candling. All right, So Chuck, you teased everybody with ear candling. Why don't you tell everyone what that is? It's hokem okay, describe the hokem well ear candling. And a lot of people don't know this, I think. I think a lot of folks say, like, oh my gosh, it's the best thing ever. Um. It is also known as auricular candling or coning, and it is a procedure once you put a cone shaped um waxy cone shaped device in the ear canal um and it's got usually a plate underneath it between the cone in your ear, and you light it on fire. And supposedly what it does is that you stick the thing in your ear and then light it on fire. Yeah, supposedly what it does is it creates a vacuum to pull out um impurities. Right because the flame supposedly needs oxygen, while the flame definitely needs oxygen to burn, and it's getting its oxygen by sucking it out of the ear canal through the cone, hence creating a vacuum. And as it does, like you said, it sucks out impurities and ear wax and supposedly also clears your sinuses, um, clears the the plaque out of your um den drites and all sorts of stuff like that. Yeah. This one article by Lisa roe uh Rosen, m D. Said she went to and this was in the nineties, but she went to a Discovery expo in Atlanta and said that they had ear candle ers there and one of the exhibitions and the lady said that ran the booth quote it cleans the whole head, brains and all they're all connected, you know, Oh yeah end quote. UM. And of course it was in Atlanta. I'm like, oh great, although that doesn't necessarily mean that could be anyway. You're right, but um, there is there are a lot of people that think, you know, it's um, it's a cleanse for your ear, and it does connect to your brain and it clears your head, and it's a spiritual thing and you know, they don't know where exactly it came from, but uh, China and ancient Tibet and yeah, pre Columbian South America, Atlantis. Yeah, they all are cited as places where it might have happened. Yeah, no one has any idea where this stuff originated. Could have been created in the US and the seventies for all anybody knows. Should we read some of the things that supposedly helps. Yeah, we should probably also say if you haven't been able to tell by now, um, science is thoroughly debunked. Ear candling um. And this is from that article. There's something that Dr Rosen and some of her colleagues got together and kind of step by step took down the idea. Yeah, there's a list of like forty things. We won't go to them all, but release vertigo, clears the eyes, purifies the blood, um aids sinusitis, relieves ear aches, opens and aligns in your chakra, releases blocked energy, reduces stress, intention stabilizes your emotions. Um, it does none of that, because it is it is just been proven to be an outright not only fraud but dangerous right. So, and here's why so. Um. The first one is that you can't pass liquids and gases through an ear drum that isn't perforated or ruptured um. So it's not sucking anything out of your inner ear, or your um lymph system, or your sinuses or your brain. That's where your ears pop when you're in a plane. Right, If if you could pass air through there, that wouldn't happen. There would be no atmospheric pressure going on. Right, So that means that sticking an ear candle in your outer ears not going to suck anything out because it can't pass through. That's that's point one, right, that's point one. Point two is oxygen. Uh, well, it will create that vacuum and and suck out the impurities. Yeah, and that is just not true. Yeah apparently and it and Yeah, doing trials of ear candles, they weren't able to um create a vacuum in any of them, So there's no vacuum created, that's right. Uh. There's also uh the idea that if a vacuum were created, it would suck impurities out. Apparently after ear candling some of these, at least one of the same trials studied the stuff the residue that was found afterwards, like I guess in the stump of the ear candle. Well yeah, and that's what people point to because there's all this gunk and they're like, look at all this stuff that came out of my ear. Oh my god. Right, So what it turns out to be is ash from the ear candle and left over wax from the ear candle, but not just ear candle, not ear whax, just the candle residue. Yeah, like they tested the substance that is not cerebumay in any former fashion. Uh, the what about the idea that it's safe and effective. I think we took care of the effective part, but the safe thing, apparently there's a lot of injuries you can get from it. Um that you can be burned is one thing. Um, you can perforate your ear drum, you can get infections. Um, you can get built up of the candle wax to replace whatever wax you think you're getting out. Yeah, it could have the reverse effect exactly. And then um, one woman actually died from a fire that was caused in two thousand five from ear candling. I looked it up. She was doing it, I guess by herself on her bed and the ear candle fell out of her ear and caught her bed sheets on fire. And she made it out of her house fine, but she was asthmatic and had an asthmatic reaction to the smoke and died. How did happen that fast? I don't know. I guess she had some bunch of bed sheets or something of like some flammable material. Um, there is a company I won't name the company, but one company that made it. And if you it came with a seventy five page manual and a thirty minute video tape. I guess this is a while ago. It was a video tape and candles and plate guards and flame retarded cloths and oil and then uh otoscope. And if you read the flyer with this kit, it says, quote it supplies you with everything you need for a safe and effective session of entertainment right for entertainment purposes only because apparently, I think it says that Canada regulates those things. Are the US does those medical devices? If they make any health claims? Yeah, I think they're illegal in Canada outright. Um, or at least they were. I'm not sure if they still are, but um, yeah, the f d A won't even I mean, you can't make any kind of claim on the box if you if you get an ear candle at your little health food store, just read it carefully. They can't make any claims for entertainment purposes because it's a hoot to put a candle in your ear and light it on fire. There was one other thing I came across in the articles you sent me, Um, and I don't know if it's true, but it sounds fantastic that if if you could create a vacuum with an ear candle, the negative pressure created by the vacuum would rupture your ear drop them right, which sounds pretty awesome. Yeah. I don't know if it's true. It wasn't backed up with a source or anything like that. I couldn't find it anywhere else, but it's pretty hilarious. Yeah, So don't ear candle people. And if you write in and say no, you should see the stuff that comes out. It is not your ear wax. You should put that stuff beneath the gas chromatograph and see what you think. I mean, it's proven. This is like what was we talked about recently, the crop circles. Man, we got eat from that to people like no, it's not proven. What was it. I think it was that Oklowa's crop circles. When we're like, no, they've proven that. These guys came out and said we made it up. No, I know what they were saying though, like it. It's just like we were talking about with ESPs. Because you can disprove right, right, some of it doesn't mean that this proves all of it. Except with crop circles. We should come up with the stuff. You should have a T shirt. Friends don't let friends ear candle. Yeah, yeah, I just love your ear wax. Yeah, let it fall out on your shoulder and let someone point it out and you say that's nature baby, Yeah, it's because I eat celery. Uh. If you want to know more about your wax, you can type the word into the search bar at how stuff works dot com. I think we have it done as one word maybe uh yeah, uh and uh, I said search bar, which means it's time for listening to mail. I'm gonna call this ice cream follow up. We've got a lot of good stuff on ice cream. People really liked that episode. Hey guys, I'm a student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Started listening to your podcast just this week, and I'm officially hooked. I'm listening to your podcast on ice cream. That's really interesting because I've worked in an ice cream parlor for the last five summers. Wilson's opened in nineteen o six and it's still going strong today, one of the most famous restaurants in Wisconsin. Uh. There are definitely different types of vanilla ice cream. We use two types, French or deluxe vanilla and purple vanilla. The label on this other vanilla is purple. We use purple vanilla for shakes and malts because it's less rich allows for the flavor of the shaker malt to be more distinguished. He saw French vanilla and ice cream cone Sundays and floats, and you mentioned having root beer floats. Reminded me of an interesting thing that I've noticed. People often get offended when they order a black cow and we have to ask them what it is. That's because almost everyone has a different idea of what a black cow consists of. Some say that it's a root beer float. Some say that it's a root beer float with chocolate ice cream. Some say it's a coke float, some say it's a blended root beer float, etcetera, etcetera. Somehow they all got labeled as black cow. Thanks for giving them me more ice cream knowledge. I'll actually be able to answer customers now when they ask what the difference between ice cream and frozen yogurt is? And that is from Andrea Nelson and she says, ps, those nasty, cheap cones with the flat bottoms are known as cake cones. Yeah, I saw that afterwards. Don't order them ever there. I mean, if you had Jason's Delhi and that's all they got, oh, is they have the free ice cream? Right? Huh? Yeah? And that's how it was. Like the day that we recorded ice Cream and I couldn't remember the name of the count I think I ended up going that night and there was cake cone. I was like, yes, cake cone. Somebody else called it a wafer cone, but I think that's just wrong. I see where that would come from, because it's wafer esk. Yeah, I mean it makes sense, but I've never seen it called that before, and that's too close to waffle cone, right, you know, right? It makes people confused. So thanks to Andrea Nelson for that one.
