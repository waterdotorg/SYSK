Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know from how Stuff Works dot com. Hang and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, Charles W. Chuck Bryant's right there, Jerry's right there. It's a little chilly in here. So it's Stuff you should know the podcast because it's chili. That's the cherry on top. That's right. Uh, spoiler or not spoiler teaser At the end of this episode, let's say, between the end and before listener mail that's agreeable to you. At the forty three minute more, we are going to taste soilent for the first time live on the air. Yeah, I guess I should have thought this too. I took him out of the fridge already, so three minutes for it to warm up. Should we put them back? Well, I wouldn't you know. I wasn't gonna say anything. Then I was going to say something. Should I put them back? Well, it's probably best cold. Okay, We'll hang on everybody, So, yes, we're gonna try soiling eventually in this episode. That's right. I'm excited to try soil it or to talk about both. Okay, So Chucky just kind of gave it away alongside the title we're talking about keene wa today, not quinoa, no keena, that's right. But super food, yes, some I saying yeah. I mean you can make a pretty good claim that it is a super food. And what is the super food if not a type of food that has a lot going on just in and of itself. It's super Yeah, like blueberries are super food or a saberry super food or a si e berries. Yeah, algae was I didn't know algae was? I buy that? Hemp seeds, chia seeds, yeah, A lot of nuts, rich crackers, M, I don't know. Those are just super super delicious buttery. Yeah, with my crabb dip especially one day, maybe I'll find out what you just want me to bring you grabbed up? Ye, give me a cooking lesson. Uh So Keinwa. There at least a hundred and twenty varieties and it is nothing new. It's been around. In fact, we might as well delve into a little history here. It's been cultivated for geez, more than five thousand years. I saw up to eight thousand years. Almost more than five thousand, well, I guess we could say more than five years. More more than the last six months. Chema has been around on this planet. Yeah, and it's Andean plant and specifically originated um around Lake Titty Kaka in Peru, in Bolivia in the altiplan. Yeah, it's wonderful, wonderful area. Have you been. Oh no, but just look at photos. Sure, Machu Picchu, You're like, well, look at that place exactly one day. Maybe I'd like to go for sure, But it is um. There is historical evidence of it um being domesticated, like we said, is maybe as long as eight thousand years ago. And they even saw in uh in ancient tombs, they saw a little you know, archaeological drawings and things that what they think is keen wa. So people were ingesting it and using it as a super food way back when. Yeah. And the fact that it grew up there, or grows up there, and not only grows, but thrives up in this high rocky I think, pretty much arid plateau that's also very cold. It doesn't make any sense that you'd have anything but like al PACs and lama's up there. But in fact, there's a plant that's one of the most nutritious foods on the planet that just so happens to thrive up there in Bolivian Peru in the highlands. That's pretty awesome, it is, And so of course they they have used this for thousands and thousands of years, um, and it wasn't. It wasn't until I think the early twentieth century that it really started to make its way for the first time out to the United States. I think the U. S d A got their hands on it and tried to get farmers to grow it here in the States, and they said, nah, let's give it another hundred years, maybe a little less. Yeah, I mean the twenty first century is when it really kind of became popular. And even in the last she's mid two thousand's you can even talk about it being trendy. Well supposedly the whole trend for keen wa, which, by the way, in typical stuff, you should know, fashion has already come and gone, and now we're doing an episode on it. Oh it's not gone, are you sure? Oh? Yeah, Okay, Well, do you know how keen Wa hit the hit the map, hit the scene, Well, in a lot of different ways. I assume you think it's one thing only Oprah. Yeah, she had something to do with it, for sure. She she was on some sort of cleansed diet in two thousand and eight, and um, she uh eight keen jan mushrooms, I guess, And everybody was like, what is that? And she's like, oh, you've been calling it kenoa, it's keen wa. And he said, well we have to try this now. Yeah, she definitely was a factor Oprah. Her reaches wide, but it doesn't reach me. You're not an opre fan. No. I think she's fine, But I didn't learn about keene wa from her or anything else where. Did you learn about keene then? Just you know, I think the first time I had it was in a restaurant. So it's to me it's spread because chefs started using it because they watch Oprah exactly. Chefs don't serve anything unless zero uh. Here in the United States, um, you know, talked about at least a hundred and twenty varieties. You're more than likely going to be eating the red, red, white, and blue, no red or black varieties of keenwa. And do you eat it in your home? I guess we'll get to this stuff, but I'm curious of vive cooked with it a lot, not a lot? Now I had it here, they're had in a couple of restaurants. So this stuff is Uh. It's known as an ancient grain, but it's not exactly a grain, and it's not exactly a cereal. It's classified technically as a pseudo cereal. Like fruity pebbles, that's a cereal. They just came out with cinnamon pebbles. Oh, but does a good Yeah, you could they click cinnamon old shoes and put them in a cereal box and it'd be good. But Quinwa technically is a pseudo cereal. Um. It comes from the goose foot plant, right, that's why it's not a cereal. Cereal is a grain that comes from a grass, and goose Foot's not a grass, it's a plant. No. And it looks kind of weedy, and as we'll see later when you're cultivating, it looks alarmingly like some other we with the capital W. It looks like marijuana, a little bit from afar. That brilliant red and brilliant yellow marijuana looks like I'm not sure you know what marijuana is. Uh, I'll show you a picture something, okay. Um. It is labeled the whole grain though, because it's actually it fits the whole grain definition because it is the whole grain seed which you're eating. Yeah, Like when you talk about grains usually again you're you're talking about these things from grass is like wheat, right, and there's such a thing as whole grain wheat. But once we process something, once we mill it or um shell it, smack it on the bottom, whatever you do to them, you're actually removing certain parts of the grain. Right. So with like um enriched white flower, that's you've taken a whole wheat grain and you've removed the brand and the journey, and you've just got yourself the endosperm still. And the endosperm is what's used mostly for to produce white flower. And that's great. It's full of like quick, easily digestible carbs, but a lot of the nutrients are lost and actually not easily digestible for many people. That's true too, um, but a lot of the nutrients are lost in the process. So even if you can digest it no problem, you're not getting most of the nutrients that were there in the first place. With a whole grain, it's got the brand, the germ, and the endosperm, and they're all working together to make you vastly healthier than you would be if you're just eating the endosperm like you do in white white flower and um quinoa in particular. Is it's really weird when you look at it. It's closer. You wouldn't think so, but it's closer to shard and beats and spinach plant is anything else. Yeah, it's crazy. So imagine if, like from spinach plants, we got not only the leaves but also the seeds turned out to be whole grains. That's what's going on. It's a weird plant. It is. It shouldn't grow where it grows. It shouldn't be a cereal, shouldn't be a grain, It shouldn't be related to beats, shouldn't be delicious, but it is. Uh, and it's super super good for you, Like we're saying, it's a super food and um. One of the reasons, and another thing that makes it very strange is that it has a ton of protein, which is pretty unusual for a plant to have this much protein. Yeah, this article made that point, but I wouldn't. Look, there's a lot of other plants that have pretty good amounts of protein in them. What rivals keenwa at a mommy black beans, lima beans, chickpeas all beat it by a mile. Yeah. I just thought it was weird because not only did this article say it, I ran across it elsewhere too that they were like, this is it's amazing how much protein it has, and it has like a decent amount, especially for a plant. It's just not like eye popping or anything like that. You know, he's gets hyperbole. I kind of pooh pooed that one. Okay, yeah, what it does have, unless you think is not true as well, Well, I'll be the judge of ten at least ten amino acids. And uh, that's good, right? Or is it bad too? I guess it's okay. No, it's chock full of amino acids, which is great for your body because our body cannot make amino acids, so we have to get them from food sources. Well, they it can't make essential amino acids. It can make essential, non essential amino acids, but the essential ones we have to get from food. And Keenoa is in a very small group of plants that are um complete sources of protein, meaning that they have all of the essential amino acids that we need in them. Yes, you don't find that and plants very frequently. That's what helps make it a super food exactly. Uh, it's not very high in calorie, no sugar, no cholesterol, no sodium. What else? ZINCC has a lot of potassium too. Apparently it has the most potassium of any food plant that that is around. Potassium is really good at regulating blood pressure because potassiums in charge of things like fluid retention and electrical conduction throughout cells. Um. I think just compared to grains, there are plenty of other fruits with potassium. Okay, is that what it was? Yeah? Like bananas are loaded with potassium, are they? Or is that the work of Edward Bernice? No, bananas are really good for you. Uh what else? Fiber, magnesium, full late, Yeah, that's good free. Well that's a big one man. So it's very commonly touted as a gluten free um food grain UM, which is good for people who have Celiac disease. But apparently they've tested there's at least would you say, a hundred and fifty varieties that are like agricultural production right now, and um, somebody tested a bunch of them and they came up with like at least four that created a Celiac response, Yeah, so you gotta be careful. For the most part, they are gluten free, but they there are a few varieties out there that can touch off. The old Celiac response. Well, I think one of the deals though, is we're not seeing those in the marketplace though, which is one of the We'll get to it, but it's one of the potential problems is we're only eating like three or four of the varieties, and I think those are for sure gluten free. Like if you go to your grocery store, you're not gonna see varieties of this stuff, you know. Yeah, you're probably right. Uh all right, Well, let's take a break and we're gonna get back and talk a little bit about cooking this delicious stuff. Oh so, Chuck, you were going to lay it on everybody how to cook quene wa. It's easy. If you can cook rice, you can cook quene wa. Yeah. I would say, well, it's easier than I would say it's easier than rice. It doesn't stick like rice does. Yeah, exactly. That's probably rice's biggest downfall, the sticky Yeah. Um, it's also what makes it great though, too. Sure, depending up what kind of rice you're getting, Um, I eat keene waite the house. I wouldn't say a lot, but enough, like every couple of weeks. Oh yeah, that's a lot, is it? Wait? It is to me? So what you do is you want to rinse it? Yeah, like you will some kinds of rice. The bag you're you're buying is probably going to say pre rinsed or pre washed or something like that. You want to rinse it anyway, right, Yeah, they have this um. It's actually really good for you, this coating called sapping in um. And despite it's it's great health effects, when you add water to it, it lathers up like a soap. H yeah, and in fact it means it's from the Latin sapo, which is soap. So you don't want to eat it even though it's good for you know, the plant produces it to keep like pests away from it from eating it. Yeah, so you rinse that stuff off get keen when once you see it, it's really tiny. So you want to get a really fine strainer, not like a colander. You get a calndar. Then all like keena is gonna be where set down the drain man. I hate mondays, so get like a sifter really fine, sifter rinse it real good until it's the water is running clear, and um, base plea cook it like rice. It's uh one part keene watered, two parts water or broth. Well that's what I do. I used chicken broth. You'd be a madman is to use like water or veggie broth if you're you know, weird or off the meat. I'm just kidding. Um, beef broth if you're gross. That doesn't pair well with keen wa. I could see it not. I'm just not a big beef broth guy. I might have said, beef you did with th? Yeah, that's kind of cute beef broth beef broth. But I used chicken. I used like half. So if I do the two cups of water, I'll do one cup water, one cup chicken broth. Oh you cut your chicken broth? Yeah, I just kind of do half and half. I got stomp on it. Yeah. Uh so then you cook it like rice, like I said, you're gonna boil it and then once it gets to a boil covered up, turn it down low and wait and let it simmer until it's all soaked up. Yeah, and then this started. Well I'm not as acquainted with cooking keen on as you are. But this article says that you want to look for the spirals, the seed spirals to be prominent. What's the deal with that? You'll see when you look at it, like before you cook it, it looks different than afterward. And that's the easiest way to say it. Like, once you look, it's almost like they pop open or something. And um, it's just quite obvious. It's just big and light and fluffy. You see the little seed spiral. What's need is and we kind of walked past it. But you said it a couple of times that that stepping in is um good for you, really good for you? Yeah, it has some amazing properties, like it's anti tumor, anti ulcer uh, anti inflammatory, And so you have to imagine, like again that this plant is growing in this random place where plants aren't really supposed to grow, and it thrives there and it's full of all these new treents and the outer coating is that anti inflammatory, anti tumor agent that you wash away? Yeah, it's kind of sad. You could save it, sip on it later. I wonder what would happen, Like, how would you have to ingest. Do you think, like, would it have any anti inflammatory properties if you like drank sappening? Do you think or do you need to like inject it into your eye, I don't know, or mix it into a salve, maybe rub on your skin. Yeah, I'm not sure. That's a good question. I bet people know. We'll hear about that up in Bolivia. They know. Uh. So you can eat it in a variety of ways. You can just eat it as a side dish like you would with rice or cuscus or whatever, mashed potatoes. Although I would eat the mashed potatoes. You could mix it with mashed potatoes, right, No, I wouldn't do that. One one thing that the author of this article, I think it's a Leah hoyt um. She said that she likes to mix it in instead of breadcrumbs into like meatballs or burger. Why not keen wa burger? Yeah? So is there such a thing as a keen wa burger? That's just keen wah? Could you make that? Or do you need something to bind it? I think you probably need binding agents, yeah, beef broths or I don't know. I've never made a keen war burger and I don't make any kind of edgie burger by like in my home, So I wouldn't really know how to go about that. What do you do turkey burgers? Or I do turkey? Turkey burgers are pretty good depending on the brand. Some are just like what is this texture? Yeah, I mean, I'm making myself with my own little recipe. But um, that's just because Emily didn't eat beef beef. So I've gotten so into the turkey burger that I don't even really I mean, I'll I'll have a beef burger out never home. You and I are sympatico on the home burger cooking. Yea, do you grill or do you skill it? Foreman grill? Oh yeah, it's pretty great. Half. We watched that grease strip out of the front, and I've noticed many times like I will do on the same ling grease out of my mouth. Uh. So here's my favorite keen whye dish. And I got it from a restaurant in New York, uh that I can't remember. But they're all kinds of variations, but I have it. Um, I cook it and then put it in the fridge and chill it like overnight. So in the summer, I will get that cold keenewa and then dice up like some cucumber and some red onion, and I mean kind of anything you want like that fits a salad summer salad, like orange pepper, like crunchy green pepper or roasted red pepper, garlic, throw some pine nuts in there right now, like you get some basil, some fresh herbs. That's the way to go, man. Yeah, like anything that strikes your fancy. Maybe a little lemon juice, little apple cider, vinegar, but the base of it is yeah, and you just mix up anything that you kind of you know, it might add some texture like that crunch and um, and serve it along. I'd like a burger instead of fries. Oh yeah, it's really really good. And you know me, I'm not. I'm not into healthy foods like that a lot, which means it's good, which means it's really good and packs with protein, don't forget. That's right. It's the complete source of protein. So that's or maybe some dried cranberry or golden raisins. We're not big on that kind of stuff in the salad. Oh yeah, I know a lot of people like it. Not me. I don't love the golden raisins, but I do like the cranberry. Yeah, yeah, I think it's nice. All right. So that's Chuck's recipe of the week. It's pretty good. We'll do that every week, no matter what the topic is. What are you gonna come up with the degrade? Oh? Just you wait? Um, So here's the deal with keen wa. It's gotten really trendy. So in two thousand and seven, the United States was importing uh seven point three million pounds of keena. They were imported fifth seven million pounds and who god knows what it is this year. You know, a lot of that was the direct result of a single person of what of Oprah? Yeah, it all comes down to Oprah. No, there's this dude. Um. He was a U N development worker from Bolivia who had moved to California, and um, he had obviously grown up at least familiar with keene wife not eating keenewa. His name was Sergio Nouniez the Arcode, and he he saw that keen wa was starting to catch on a little bit. I guess he saw that episode of Oprah. So we went back to Bolivia and he found that there were only a few indigenous producers who were putting out like retail sized bags of keene wa. So he went around and he basically created a co op out of all the indigenous farmers who create, go grow keen Wa and Bolivia and made the supply from them reliable enough and big enough too. It's to supply industry abroad around the world. And this guy almost basically was the flash point for the keen wa explosion. He helped it happen, and he made sure that it was based on the work of the people who were originally cultivating keen wa. Yeah, which is a big one. Yeah. He went from in two thousand five he sold twenty five thousand dollars worth UH through his company, and these days he saw him about twenty six million dollars worth annually from his own facility and about forty million from other facilities. So he basically went around to them and said, Hey, these weekend farmers markets are cute, but how would you like to be a part of the industrial food supply. You put down that pamphlute. We're talking business here. Did they play the pamphlute? Yeah? Because Andy and Highlanders they love that love that junking. Is that where zam Fears from. No, I think Sam Fear is. I think he's Mediterranean. I wanted to say Greek and pretty sure. Okay, I don't know if I'm getting He and Yanni confused, though, oh yeah, maybe we are. They seem like they probably at least go bowling together. Yanny didn't play the pan fleet, that did he? No, No, Sam Fear is definitely master of the pan Fleet. Of course, you can't call yourself that on a CD unless Oprah has said so and that has the stamp of approval. So um, the price has really gone up to as a result, and it was not small um for a lot of years. One metric ton was about five dred dollars and in two thousand and ten that was dollars. So that's almost threefold. And again that was six years seven, almost seven years ago. I kept going up to I think it picked in two. Yeah, it was. The price went up quite a bit, so you would think that's great. These farmers are making a ton of money now right, Yes, apparently. I don't know where it started, but somebody created um some I guess somebody wrote an article or started digging around and they said, hey, everybody, you guys are eating all this keen walk. Guess what you did. You drove up prices so much that the very indigenous people who have been cultivating this for thousands of years can't afford it anymore. So. Stuck on that hipster, right, Like the people of Fiji are exporting Fiji water, but they're all don't have clean drinking water themselves. That kind of same thing, right. It's basically an American pastime to take hipsters down to peg, isn't it? Is it? It seems like anything hipsters Like everybody goes to a lot of trouble to dig around and find what's wrong with it. Yeah, like the one thing they can trace back I just gotta be bled on the hands somewhere. All right, Well, let's take a break and we'll talk a little bit about, um, what this all means and whether or not that's even true. Right after this? Oh all right? So, Uh, if it's being produced um in the Andes and prices are going up, you would think that at some point people in the United States might try and take a stab at it. And that's exactly what happened, uh and is happening. Uh. And you sent this great article is Keenwa California farmers in New Kale because Kale had a similar explosion uh in popularity, you know, over the past few years. Yeah, I think Kale is out now, yeah, or at least made fun of, I think for being too hipstory and hot. Yeah, I think the hipsters kind of chewed that up and spit it out. But it's still great. I know. People just hate all that stuff. Yeah, you know, really just like what's trending and what's not and what we think is cool, let's write about it, right, And I've read this really interesting article. I think it was a Mother Jones writer, like a Mother Jones Egg writer who basically said, like, hey, dudes, all of this stuff that you know suddenly like the hot new super food. It's niche um food marketing. It's the same thing as like Oreos coming out with a new flavor every like couple of months that you gotta go try or something like that, Like you're just a sheep for kale. But but yeah, but but geared towards people who don't eat junk food. But it's the same exact things. It. Don't be a chump, yeah, or at least don't get on your high horse about the other stuff saying mass marketed or being eaten by idiots and SAPs and simpletons. So the thing is the thing that made it even even worse though, was the idea that like the huge demand in the expanded market for keen ua that was largely found in the United States, was directly responsible for pricing indigenous farmers who were growing that keen wah out of it, so they weren't even eating it, was the problem and right, and what they found was that one they couldn't afford it, they've been priced out, or they were making the decision to where yeah, they're making more money now, but they would rather sell all their keen wa and buy less expensive, less nutrient dense food for their families. So the very people producing keen wah were not only couldn't afford it, they also were being malnourished as a result of this keen wah explosion. So it was a big deal. It made a lot of people's second guess it, uh feel pretty bad about themselves. And I also guarantee it had a negative impact on the keen wah market as well, which would directly affect the farmers. But what you dug up though on this um mprs the salt I guess blog their food blog. Yeah, that was a story about it attached to it as well. It was pretty eye opening. Yeah, these dudes got together and they um were trying to get to kind of the root of all this, and so they got a data source. Uh eat an a h oh. It's the National Survey of Peru that they carry out every year, um about just Peruvian households and all kinds of stuff data that they're collecting, but one of them is food. And there are twenty two thousand randomly selected households. So they got ten years worth of this data covering from before the keen Wa boom, um a few years before through the keen Wa boom, so they could kind of do a good comparison. And they split the households into three groups. Uh, those who grow and eat kenwa, those who eat it but don't grow it, and those who neither grow it nor eat it. They say, yeah, I guess there's the final householders, people that pronounce it quanila. It's like one household in Peru. It's like, what is this stuff? Uh? And they all three showed a clear rise in their welfare which they measured as a total value of goods consumed as that price of kenwa rose um. And apparently that reflected in the increased living standards in Peru as a whole too. Right, So at the height of that boom, uh, the welfare of the growers increased more rapidly than the other two groups though, which you would you know that makes sense? Yeah, and so you can. They they basically tracked a direct correlation between the keen wa boom around the world and a rise in the household welfare of keen wa farmers back in Prue. So they conclusively proved pretty much that there there was no um that these farmers weren't too poor to afford keenwa. But the other one was still left standing, right right, the idea that they were selling are all their keen wa. But then they were still male nurse because they were buying less nutritionally dense Yeah, and that apparently they managed to disprove as well. Yeah, at least that's what they're saying in this paper. I mean, we're not saying this is evidence, but at least this is what they dug out after pouring over these ten years worth of of studies Uh. They said this guy Andrew Stevens, a doctorial candidate UM, focused on specifically the Puno region and the Andies, which grows about eight of all the keen jan Peru. And he said, this is a it's a cultural and nutritionally important food, but it's not. I think the gist was people are trying to make it out to be like this is what they subsist on every day and they can't afford to eat it. And he said, this is actually a pretty small part of their diet overall, and they're actually eating more keenwa than ever before in that region that grows the most. That was pretty surprising. So uh, it said they did not come cut back their consumption between two thousand four and twenty twelve despite a fourfold price increase. They see no signs of changing calories, proteins or carbohydrates in the diet across Peru as a whole. Right, so they kind of debunked it. Pretty cool. Hipster's rejoice, They shall rejoice, But UM, there's still some outstanding problems. Right, So, like you said, it was, you said that I mentioned it was a culturally important food, so much so that Bolivia UM and it's drafted two thousand nine Constitution and shrine keen was part of their food sovereignty, which is their right to protect culturally important food. Yeah, like, hey, you're coming in here and you're basically taking this and now you're gonna grow it all over the world, right, and they recognize the importance of kima. For a very long time. There was apparently a Colorado researcher who went to Bolivia in and was shot dead trying to smuggle keen wassies out of the country. And I guess somebody from Colorado eventually got him out because Colorado State University patented a hybrid keenwa based on Bolivian seeds, and the government Oblivia called them bio pirates. Yeah, that's not something you want level there at you not probably Bolivia. Uh. The other thing too, and I think you sent me this was that, um, because there's more. Basically there's sort of a land grab going on. Yeah, this is where I was going in Peru where all of a sudden they realized that you know, before when it wasn't worth that much money they I mean, sure they were producing it, but it wasn't like it is now. So all these people are saying, wait, this this land that was once unused, like is anyone claiming it? And there's sort of a rush to claim these lands. Well, there was fighting going. Yeah, there was violence that broke out in February of I think two thousand fifteen, maybe four sorry, two thousand fourteen, where um one guy got his arm blown off by dynamite during this battle among hundreds of farmers for some land that had been sitting there abandoned for like decades. And part of the problem is when you're doing good agricultural practices, what do we talk about no till farming in I can't remember, Well, we've definitely talked a lot about that. Um and when you're using good agricultural practice is one of the main things you want to do is let um fields lie fallow for a year season at a time. And they're not doing that anymore in the Andes. And again, this is really really fragile crop land that they're growing this stuff in, so they're not letting it lay fallow any longer. And they're also using lama's less and lamas and keen wa go together like rice and beans, which by the way, is another complete um protein food. But it's not just a single food, so he can food. Yeah. Yeah, man, what was that episode? It's totally on the tip of my tongue. We talked a lot about no till no till farming. I can't remember. I want to say I had something to do with the dust bowl, but we didn't do one on the dust bawl. We did. We did one on the dust ball and desertification. Maybe it was the yeah good one. Um yeah. So the llamas, that's one of the big issues, right, is that they're not letting them poop everywhere. Well they're not. They're not lama farming like they used to. Laun Llamas use a lot of grazing land and they're like, we can use that instead to um grow keenwa because keene was more valuable than lama's right, But lamas again and keen wa go together like rice and beans, and llama poop is almost like it's designed or tailored to fertilize keenewa. They started to use sheep poop instead, I guess imported sheep poop and it allows a lot more pests and invasive weeds than lama poop does. When lama poop is fertilizing. So the whole ecosystem is definitely being um altered. Yeah, and not necessarily in good ways because of this huge demand and this huge influx of cash. It's basically more money, more problems. Yeah, the the Alto planos people are finding out. It's so weird. We're not weird, but kind of sad that you can't you know, it can't just be a success story never, you know. I guess in the long run. They're also worried that um I was talking about all those different varieties. Um I saw the twenty but it says here there could be up to thousands of different varieties, and farmers are abandoning most of these to concentrate on the ones that they can sell to you know, ship out to export to American markets or I guess just you know, not just America. I think Europe has eating stuff like crazy too. Yeah, but um it says that those varieties are This guy says that, um they're the future of keenwa because they can adapt to things like climate change. And you narrow the varieties down to a certain few and they don't adapt, then you're kind of screwed. You're s o l if you have three thousand to choose from to try to adapt to changing climate, then yeah, you're way better off. So crop diversity is pretty important. But yeah, that's getting erased as well. Yeah, well they're trying to encourage it with these Andean farmers at least. Uh. They are working with Bolivia and Peru to develop internal markets for these threatened varieties, like with school food programs and stuff like, not necessarily to sell, but to use like within the country at hospitals and schools. They said they've been fairly successful with some of that stuff, so um, hopefully that continues. See that. To me, that's what government subsidies are for stuff like that, for like small indigenous farmers who are protecting thousand year old varieties of crops that are part of the cultural um fabric of a country for the future. For all. They are growing in California though that article you sent this dude is growing it in in the Sonoran Desert, crazy in the Imperial Valley below sea level, in like one of the hottest places in North America. They're growing keena. Yeah, and well, part of the problem is keena is very closely related. I think it's in the same genus as um, something called Lamb's quarters, which doesn't really matter up in the Alto Plano, but in California, Lamb's quarters is a toxic, toxic plant to live stock which might accidentally graze on it because they're not thinking about that kind of stuff. And then it also um carries a virus that kills alfalfa, which is very much growing in California to feed that live stock. So there's it's a it's a weird, it's a complex, amazing plant that shouldn't exist. Yeah, maybe that'll be the title quene wa olan complex more complex than you think. That's a good one. Or maybe it should say, well, never mind, I'll figure that out. Should we just brainstorm some more? And let's show title. Are we gonna try the soilent? Yes, let's um and then do listener mail. Yeah, let's do that all right? So, uh, here we are. We're gonna try this. Yeah, soilent. It's in a white bottle. We called a lot of flak about not having tried it and still done something. I'm like, well, here we go. Then I'm not iridescent, but I've done an episode on iridescent. Give me a break, people, I think you should probably shake well, right, I think so, I don't know. We gotta go back and listen to the episode against been a while. People also thought that that was a sponsored episode by Soilent, and I was like, I think we said enough bad things about the taste. You should have figured out that it was not. All right, here we go, So this is us trying. So we also want to say thanks again to Don Kent for sending this in. It smells like, this is a nice kind of nice smell. What does that smell like? It smells like cereal milk. We got that a lot. A lot of people said it smells like or it tastes like cheerios milk. It's totally what it smells like. Can we say cheerios? Or is this an episode for Cheerios? Now? All right, I'm gonna should we do the same one. I thought we were chucking the whole thing. No, oh, that's that's not bad. It is It's not bad at all. A cheerio cereal milk. I think I'm I would have come up with that even if somebody hadn't said it. This is good. Yeah, I mean it's sort of Bland's definitely it's not nearly a sweet. It's not like a honeynut cheerio milk. No, that's true for cinnamon toast crunch milk. It's not bad. I was dreading this. I thought it was gonna be awful from all the comments. But that's not bad at all. I like it. I can see how you would kind of start to crave it because it's got that like almost a fatty mouth feel to it, you know what I mean, Like it really gets on the tongue. All right, Well, there it is. I should probably stop. It's pretty got a lot of calories in it. Yeah, I mean that's twenty if you're a daily nutrition Well thanks again and don Kent, thanks again to everybody who wrongly called us out for doing an ad for soilent. The aftertaste is a little bit like milk of magnesia. I'm not getting map like my Lanta. Yeah no, I know you mean kind of chalky. I don't have that. Hm uh oh. If you want to know more about soilent, go listen to soil lamp sub. In the meantime, if you want to know more about keen Wa, type that word q U I n O A into the search far how stuff works dot com. And since I said search bar, it's time for more Soilent, I mean it's time for listening now, all right, I'm gonna call it. Yeah. I definitely don't like the aftertaste. It sound it sort of chalking up on my throat and tongue. I kind of like this stuff. I like food more, but that's not bad. Sure Like if somebody said should I drink soil It, I'd say why not? All right, I'm gonna call this, uh, just a nice email from this lovely Australian woman. Hey guys, been a long time listener, first time writer, currently living in Sydney, Australia, though I grew up in Tennessee and uh now I'm a Florida resident all over the place, so maybe she's not a strong I've been listening to y'all. Y'all since I was in college at U t K Go Balls, and I even brought you along with me while spending a year living in France. If you do end up reading this on the air, which I don't expect, I would be so thrilled. If you give a shout out to my little sister LB, currently in Portland and so up. LB she's used a little reverse psychology, Yeah, she did. Anytime we make a road trip, we put on stuff you should know, which incites a groan from her every time. It's the chit chat that bugs her. We just gave her a shout out. YEA, well, she's not. She's not the only person to feel that way, all right. To get to the point, I was listening to the Dictator's episode and was so excited to hear you talking about Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In fact, that's my grandmother's maiden name. We pronounced it Suela, but whoever knows if that's the true pronunciation. Her family is from southern Italy and immigrated from Naples about a hundred years ago. She recently went on a trip to Italy and studied up on her ancestors sella uh and even visited a lot of the sites inscribed with his name. It's amazing to see a piece of your family history show up on your favorite podcast, even if it is about dictators. Gave me a chuckle. Thanks for keeping me entertained. This recently caught up to all the episodes on iTunes. I know, I know there are much more on your many more on your website. Wow, she's a listener. She is, and that's Sarah right now in Sydney. Thanks a lot, Sarah appreciate that. Um so, wait is she from Ustara? She's just living in Australia now I think she's just living there. Okay, got uh. If you want to let us know about your world travels and all that jazz, like Sarah did, you can tweet to us at s y s K podcast or josh um Clark. You can hang out with Chuck at Charles W. Chuck Bryant on Facebook or it Stuff you Should Know on Facebook. You can send us an email of the Stuff podcast to how Stuff Worse dot com and there's always joined us at our home on the web.
