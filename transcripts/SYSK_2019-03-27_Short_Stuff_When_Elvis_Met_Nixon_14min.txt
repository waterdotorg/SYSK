Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck, and there's Jerry, and Elvis is in the building in spirit at least, and so is Richard Nixon. Everybody's mad about that. So this is short stuff. Like I said, that's right, and this is about the very famous meeting of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon. And uh we got this information from uh December two thousands ten article in Smithsonian magazine by Peter Carlson which had some great details about this very famous meeting on December twenty one. Yes, which is that you might have thought was photoshopped. Well, do you remember one of the first photoshops we ever got from our pal Van Nostrin was of us as Elvis and Nixon. That's right. And then totally unrelated to it, our other pale who photoshops as sometimes as Aaron Cooper, actually he does it all the time, and he um photoshopped us as Elvis and Nixon too, and I think they were swapped. Pretty amazing stuff. Well, the wonders of technology. The thing is, though, right, The thing is is this is not a photoshop to image. It's a very famous image that you could get well before photoshop was ever around back in the eighties. But it is of a meeting that very few people knew about until a Chicago newspaper in said hey, everybody, the National Archives has a bunch of pictures of Elvis and Nixon together shaking hands, and you can buy them if you want, and it became the most requested picture in National Archives history in like a week. Yeah, and like Elvis as Elvis, it wasn't like he wore He's like, well, I'm gonna I'm gonna wear my suit today and just tone it down like he's fully Elvis purple lure suit with a cape if I remember correctly. And there's a movie about this too, by the way. There's two of them, Oh really, there's one from ninety seven and one from I think like two thousand something. Well, the one that I saw was the most recent one with Michael Shannon, Yes, as as Elvis. Yes, so not about it wasn't great, but Michael Shannon's awesome and everything, so it was worth it for that. Did they make like is it a fink feature length movie? Yeah? Weird, But I followed the story, you know, um, because I mean this is about like forty eight hours is the whole story. Yeah, so here's how it goes. Is it's Christmas time. Wait, I'm sorry, hold on one more thing, Chuck, I want to interject before you get started. It helps a lot to imagine Elvis totally wasted on speed throughout this entire story. Okay, okay, just better than mine. So it starts on Christmas. There's a fight at the house between Elvis's dad, Vernon, and Elvis's wife, apparently about just Christmas spending, which I think is interesting. I got the impression that they were on the same side against Elvis. Oh, I don't know, I think so maybe. But at any regard, Elvis leaves, he's not too happy. So he does that that movie trope thing where you just go to the airport and say, put me on the next flight to anywhere. Uh, and that happened to be Washington. D C goes to d Cious, stays there for a little while, and then decides to fly to l Ah to his house in Beverly Hills, which, by the way, is an Airbnb now is it? It is? But it's not. It's it's on airbnb. But you all the dates were blacked out and it didn't give a price, because I was like, I'm totally gonna try and stay there one night at some point in my life. But yeah, I don't know what the deal is, but you can go look at the house. It's pretty sweet as you would imagine. Okay. Uh So, Elvis's buddy and confidante and assistant, Jerry Shilling, gets a call. He's like, I'm going to be in l a man, pick me up. That's the great Jerry Shilling. He died. He does pick him up. And here's where we should just say that Elvis at this point in his life was obsessed with martial arts, guns and weirdly law enforcement and collecting law enforcement like honorary sheriff's and honorary badges, that kind of thing. And the thing that bound all of these common or these interests together was drugs. Being on lots and lots of drugs. Yeah, And Priscilla says this in her book. He was obsessed with the narcotics badge, the narc badge, and she said he felt that if you had that narc badge, then you could fly to any country right with your guns and your drugs and get away with it no questions. I asked Wow. So that is the that is the fantasy of a drug adult brain, probably yeature and also but it solves a practical problem too. I love my guns and I love my drugs, and I need to get them around. So I got it. I'll bet a Federal Narcotics Bureau badge, which is the predecessor to the d E A. I'll bet I could just flash one of those, add that I'm Elvis Pressley and that I got this from Richard Nixon, and boom right through with all my big garbage bag full of pills. All right. So he's in l A. He says to his his uh, Jerry Shilling, He's like, now I want to go back to d C. He didn't tell him why. And then on the way on the flight, Elvis writes a letter to President Nixon, uh sor if I can be in any service, do you? I want to help the country out and I would love to meet you. Stays in d C under a pseudonym and tells Nixon. His pseudonym said he's gonna be there in d C. And I want credentials of a federal agent. Yes, so he writes this letter. They take the red eye from l A to d c UH. They drop a letter off at six thirty a m. They check into a hotel. Personally, Elvis dropped this off at the gate of the White House, yea. And they check into a hotel, and Elvis gets restless. He's not slapped by the way, and he he decides he's going to go to the Bureau of Narcotics himself and just kind of sniff around and see what they've got going on there. So, while I'm guessing Jerry Shilling was getting some rest in a shower at the hotel room, Elvis is off at the Federal Narcotics Bureau, hasn't slept, probably out of his mind on drugs, talking to them about badges and stuff and how we'd like to meet Richard Nixon and get a badge from him. What's amazing, although it's really not amazing if you stop and think about it, is that when they dropped the letter off at six thirty, within five and a half hours, Elvis was on his way to the White House to meet with the President. All right, let's take a break there. We'll tell you about the further details of the story right after this. Alright, So the letter is delivered to an aid of Nixon named Bud. That's his nickname, Bud Crow or Krog. I I think Crow probably k R O G. H. Kroc. Right, So he delivers this or he gets this letter to Bud Croc because the front Gate people are like, Elvis delivered a letter. Uh, and it's not just like if any normal American had delivered a letter like this. One actually got to Nixon's aid pretty quickly. Uh. He was a fan of Elvis, and he's like, you know what, this is a great idea, Like Richard Nixon is not cool at all, and um, if he met with Elvis Presley, like that's really good for his image because Elvis is the coolest guy on the planet ish well nine seventy he was, he was up there. Um, so he likes this idea. He persuades eventually the Chief of Staff, Bob Haldeman to make this happen. And uh, at noon that day, Elvis shows up at the White House ready to go with a gift of a gun. He brought a cult forty five I've in a display case to give the Nixon, which he just took from the wall of his house in l A. He's like, quick and I agree, Oh, this will this will do, and it is it's it's a beautifully mounted firearm. If you're into that kind of thing, you would be like yes, especially if it came directly from Elvis's personal collection. I'm not a gun guy, but I would love Elvis. Sure. So Um, the Secret Service, of course says yes, thank you very much, we'll take that before you can go into the Oval office. And from what what do we say? Bug crows? Um? Is it crow crows? Where do we settle one? Let's just how about bug Ka? So bug Ka recounted his impressions of the story because he's in the room. He made this thing happen, because he's in elvis fan and an aide to Nixon. And he said that when Elvis walked into that Oval office, he it was plain that he was awestruck, but he regained his footing pretty quickly. And it's like, you know, mixing it up with the president um having a talk with him, a very serious talk about the problem of counter culture in the United States. Right, It's very interesting. The whole thing was so odd because Elvis was a drug addict, and he talked about the problems of drugs, and he from what I understand had a clearly distinct line between being riddled with prescription drugs uh and and illegal like street drugs, right right, because naively, if it's a prescription drug and it comes from a doctor, it's legitimized, like it's fine, it's legal. You know, even if you have a totally illegal amount of them on you, it's still legal. It's still a prescription drug. But a street drug. I've heard before, and I don't remember where I read. It. May have been the Uncle John's bathroom reader that he used to get so worked up about the idea of drug dealers in Memphis down the street that his he'd want to go out and shoot him and his his and he'd be heastit on drugs at the time, and his entourage would have to like calm him down and keep him, keep the guns away from and keep him just in his house to keep him from going out in exacting vigilante justice of the local Memphis street drug dealers around town. Yeah, I mean, I think I said this in the Graceland episode. You know, my family's from Memphis, and my my dear sweet grandmother passed away like fully believing and saying out loud like, well, you know, Elvis's doctors killed him. He didn't, he didn't know what was going on. They had him going every which way but loose because of his their prescriptions. And I'm like, no, Grandmoma, I mean, tell her on her deathbed. No. He was like, Elvis was a junkie right now and whispered into her here. So all right, so Elvis is all struck. Uh. This guy bud k Is is taking notes because this is pretty uh Oval office taping by Nixon. Elvis is all struck. And they're talking about the counterculture. Elvis is talking about the Beatles, how they're anti Americans and they're bad for America, and they're talking about drugs, and Elvis is showing up his collection of badges and then basically saying he basically asked him flat out, I would like a narcotics batche Can you make that happen? Yeah? How you let's coach with the chaise man pretty much? Yeah? And if Heson says well, I don't know, can we bud k And bud k was like, yeah, we can probably make that happen. He's like, all right, let's get it done. Then. So that was it, I mean within um, probably about an hour, bug K and Elvis went to lunch, and bug K produced the badge for him, um, like before the end of lunch or right after lunch ended. So funny. He also got some other like he had his bodyguard and chilling with him and Nixon. Nixon gave them some what do you give him? Cuff links? And then Elvis's was like, well, Mr presidently have wives too, you know, so he went and got him White House brooches, and Elvis just like leaves the White House of all these gifts basically right, he made a basket out of his shirt. Uh. But like we said, there was that one very famous photo. Uh, and no one knew about this. Elvis wanted to keep it quiet. Um. I imagine Nixon wasn't uh sadly wasn't able to use it as like a as a pr move. Yeah, which although I think also he was probably like what just happened? After Elvis came and went? He was just available. Yeah, it isn't little crazy. The whole thing is pretty crazy, Chuck for sure. But the year after, a columnist named Jack Anderson broke the story and apparently nobody really it didn't go anywhere, No one, it didn't become part of the cultural memory. And it wasn't until that that Chicago newspaper reported about the photos. That that was when it hit just right. I think in people were like, it didn't there, it wasn't kitchy yet, but in people were ready to be blown away by the idea of Nixon and and Elvis together. That's right, And so it was in the National Archives. Then all of a sudden, you can make a request for the copy of that photo, and uh, within one week, eight thousand people requested that. And it's still I'm not sure if it still is, but for a while it was the most requested photograph in the history of the National Archives. Pretty amazing, there you go. Yeah, it was finally supplanted by Obama meeting with that alien in the Oval Office, that famous photograph. That's right. No, when Obama met with the lead singer of corn A right here you go. Yeah, you got anything else? Nope? Well good because we don't have time for it anyway. It's a short stuff. We'll see you guys later for more on this and thousands of other topics. Is it how stuff works? Dot Com
