iHeart Intro: This mind boggling episode is an old timey true crimey. It concerns one of the worst families to ever set up shop in Kansas, which is really saying something. In the early eighteen seventies, the Bender family surreptitious killings pree carried out in their own home no less, resulted in the murders of at least twenty one people which are in the family, the nicknamed the Bloody Benders. This episode will knock your socks off, assuming they're still on your feet after the other episode so far. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, So this is Stuff you Should Know. The Murder Family edition.

00:00:52
Josh: Yeah, Halloween right around the corner.

00:00:55
iHeart Intro: I've always liked to think of you, me and Jerry as a kind of murder family.

00:01:01
Josh: As in, you and I and Jerry. Right. We always have to correct that because people think you're talking about you and your wife, right, Okay, yes, you me kamma you kamma me kamma No.

00:01:12
iHeart Intro: No, I mean me, my wife, Umi and Jerry. I've always thought of this as just you know, I'm kidding.

00:01:19
Josh: I miss what you said though.

00:01:20
iHeart Intro: You thought of this as what a murder murder family?

00:01:22
Josh: Yeah, sure, in the kindest possible way.

00:01:25
iHeart Intro: Exactly, exactly. No, we're no murder family. And after everybody learns about the Bloody Benders, they'll be like, yeah, Josh and Chuck and Jerry are no murder family, and we wouldn't want to be either, because it turns out murder families are not so great.

00:01:40
Josh: Chuck, right, And can we shout out a listener who submitted this topic? Oh yeah, definitely, that's I feel like that's happening more and more like a lot.

00:01:49
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:01:50
Josh: As our world gets smaller, our listeners are reminding us that it is quite large. And we got this one from a Canson.

00:01:57
iHeart Intro: Oh that's very appropriate.

00:01:59
Josh: Is that how you say it?

00:02:00
iHeart Intro: I think it's Kanzinia Knight.

00:02:02
Josh: Okay, Kenzinia Knight named Star White. And apparently Starr was traveling with the family through Kansas and saw signs in Montgomery County for the Benders, the Bloody Benders and things commemorating this and said, I'm a Kenzania Knight and I had no idea that this was a thing. I got to learn more about this, So we're doing one. You know, we like to keep it spooky in October where we can for sure, and there's nothing spookier than a serial killing family.

00:02:36
iHeart Intro: Interestingly, too, this past I think March, what I'm taking to be is one of the definitive books on the Benders came out. It's called Hell's half Acre and it is by an author.

00:02:52
Josh: Named named a drum roll.

00:02:55
iHeart Intro: Named Susan Joe Nosis. That's how I'm going with her last name. But it came out in March called Hell'shead Figure, and it does look pretty awesome, so I figured that had to do with this, But no, it's just completely off the cuff from a listener from Kansas.

00:03:09
Josh: Huh, just driving through.

00:03:11
iHeart Intro: Great name too, by the way, Star White, what a great name. It's almost like star wipe.

00:03:17
Josh: No one, do you like it? It's your favorite transition?

00:03:20
iHeart Intro: That's right.

00:03:22
Josh: I do know a bender actually, but this is I don't think there's any relation.

00:03:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, because it's not entirely clear that that was even their names too, so we should tell a good point. We're talking about a family that lived in Kansas in the eighteen seventies at a time when Kansas was like the front Tier, maybe even beyond the front Tier. The Trail of Tears had happened by this time. So the O Sage people who had lived there previously have been forced off their land and moved further west to Oklahoma, and the federal government said, come anybody, all you criminals, you unsavory characters, people escaping your past, come and settle here in Kansas. It's like Australia, but in the center of the United States. That's right.

00:04:06
Josh: Did you do bad things back east? Just pick up your bags and head west.

00:04:10
iHeart Intro: That's precisely right. And so a lot of them stopped in Kansas. Again, this was the frontier, but people were still going west too. So as we'll find out, this family, the Bender family, kind of put up a claim or set down a claim. They did something with a claim. I'm not quite up on my old prospect or terminology. They claimed something, yeah, on this road that kind of kept leading west, and they set up a tavern in for people to stop in, which is neither here nor there quite yet, but I just kind of wanted to foreshadow that there's going to be a tavern coming in the future.

00:04:43
Josh: That's right, And that's probably a generous term for what they set up. Yeah, it was a pretty remote well, I guess, you know, not to make too many Kansas jokes, but it was a pretty remote part of Kansas and southeastern Kansas in eighteen seventy. It was not cherry Bell yet, but it would eventually become cherry Vale, right. And at first the two gentlemen arrived John benderr. He was around sixty years old. People called him Pa. He didn't talk a lot. When he did talk, it was mostly in German. And then he was with a younger guy in his twenties. And you know, we're going to say things like identified as his son or you know, may or may not have been the daughter. Like this is because of a lot of things, partially just you know, a lot of record keeping back then wasn't super solid, especially when it turns out you may be using aliases and you may be faking that you're a family or you may actually be a family. Like no one really knows for sure the facts of this, but John Bender Junior was with him, and he also occasionally went by an alias put a pin in this one named John Gebhart, Chris Gebhart. He's a comedian, he's great.

00:05:59
iHeart Intro: But apparently John Gephart or John Bender Junior, was a bit of a comedium's himself, but from some reports, he was his own audience and no one else was. So to put it in another way, he apparently laughed at stuff like inappropriately, like Doctor Hibbert, and also at times when exactly that was a great John Bender Junior impression, by the way, but at times where people were like, this guy ain't quite right. And he also talked a lot, so he was kind of an odd fixture as well, as we'll find out the whole family was.

00:06:35
Josh: Yeah, he had a German accent, but did speak fluent English, and some people think he may have been intellectually disabled looking at kind of some of the things that happen, it seems like I don't know about clear, but you know, at a time in eighteen seventy, they wouldn't have been categorizing people as such anyway, you.

00:06:55
iHeart Intro: Know, no for sure, but from the articles of the time, that's what I'm going from now on. They nobody said anything even remotely like that. I saw it on one, I think a Crime Reads article, and that was about it. I just got the impression that was really kind of weird and almost like a Jethro Clampet type. That's who he reminds me of.

00:07:18
Josh: Okay, so what they built on their one hundred and sixty acres was you called it a tavern. I call it just a big room, kind of like a bunk of a bunk house. Maybe they called it. Or Olivia, who helped us with this, called it a foothouse. But it was sixteen feet wide twenty four feet long. So what they eventually did was they would put up a canvas sheet kind of splitting it into They lived in the back, and then they called you know, they called it an inn. You called it a tavern. It was really just a room with some can goods and supplies and I think a couple of beds, sort of like a bunk house. It was not fancy at all.

00:07:57
iHeart Intro: No, but I'm guessing like as you were passing through Kansas then and maybe even today, it was pretty appealing. You think, well, I mean it was better than sleeping out on the open prairie with the bedroll, right. You know, there was a hot meal. You know, they probably had tobacco, and yeah, I mean it was better than nothing. And I think I get the impression also one of the things that made it better than nothing was the daughter who I say, we meet right now. Her name was Kate, and she showed up after this this tavern, this house had been built.

00:08:29
Josh: That's right. The two ladies were sent for after everything was done, and it was Ma Bender who everyone just sort of assumed was the wife and the matriarch of the family. She went by Elvira sometimes. She was maybe in her fifties and led on like she didn't speak any if very little, if any English at all, but.

00:08:52
iHeart Intro: I had like a terrible temper. She was widely reputed from anybody that met her that she was just a terrible cuss of a person from when I gather.

00:09:01
Josh: Yeah, in fact, I think she may have been the one sort of leading this whole charge that we'll get to.

00:09:07
iHeart Intro: I've seen both. I've seen her or I've seen Kate and Kate. Kate was the daughter. She was in her twenties. But I think more than anything, she kind of attracted passers by with flyers advertising her mediumship like she was into spiritualism and free love apparently too.

00:09:28
Josh: And who knows what that means. In eighteen seventies Kansas, she's shown a little ankle I don't know, like, I have no idea what free love means in that context, but it was unusual at least and got attention. Some people thought she may have been the daughter. Other people thought that they presented she and John Junior as a couple. So it was just sort of one of those things. It's loose out there in eighteen seventies Kansas, right.

00:09:53
iHeart Intro: So one other thing I read, Chuck that Livia didn't quite hit on was that this family, they weren't like exactly act, you know, fading into the woodwork or the prairie like. They were well known in their little community, mainly because there were only like eight or ten other settlements around them at the time, but also because I think they were the only ones running a tavern and they had an orchard That will factor in later, but apparently their cherries and apples and peaches were like really prized out there at the time. So they were part of the community, but they were known to be weird and maw in particular, which you just kind of avoided her as best as you could.

00:10:30
Josh: Right. So they have this thing set up. It's on the edge of the Great Osage Trail, which is, like you mentioned, earlier, where a lot of people continued westward and it was a good place to have a little bunk house that, you know, sold a few things. What's the word, I'm looking for.

00:10:46
iHeart Intro: A general store, Ali's, bargain houses.

00:10:51
Josh: Rations, Oh okay, yeah, selling rations and things like that.

00:10:55
iHeart Intro: They sell rations at Ali's.

00:10:58
Josh: What is Ali's.

00:10:59
iHeart Intro: It's like a deep discount liquid or like if you stole a truck, you just drive it over there and they'll buy everything and then turn around and sell it. I don't think they actually do that, but it's the appearance of that kind of thing.

00:11:11
Josh: Yeah, we should be clear, like, I've never heard of Ali's, so I'm innocent of this.

00:11:17
iHeart Intro: You should go wander around one. You'd be like, okay, I gotcha. Here's an oriental rug. Here's some off brand bleach on the next stile. Like it's just just that, yes, oh yeah, it's like that places all over the place, in every strip mall, in every city, in every in every country in the world.

00:11:37
Josh: It may be one of those things. It's so ubiquitous. I've just never noticed it. Yeah, right under my nose. It's possible, all right. So they set up an Ali's right there on the grade o Sage Trail and maybe this is a good place to take our first break.

00:11:49
iHeart Intro: Oh, I wasn't expecting that. Let me see. Okay, that sounds good, okay, chuck. So one of the things that made the Benders made us call the Benders of murder families that they started murdering people pretty shortly after they set up this homestead along the Osage Trail. And one of the things about Kansas at the time was it was really really violent, not just in the wars against the Native Americans. There there were also pro slavery and anti slavery factions that committed atrocities against one another. The Civil War eyebrid kind of broke out thanks to Kansas struggling which kind of state it was going to be. So it was a really violent place. And it was with that kind of violent backdrop that a family could just kill a bunch of travelers without anyone really taking notice. Because it was also just the kind of place where people just went missing. It just happened. It was a really dangerous place to travel. So when it happened, it didn't exactly like set off the media and search parties didn't usually come out for people.

00:13:27
Josh: Yeah. Absolutely, However, when they start turning up in regular order around town, then you've got a problem. And that's what happened. In May of eighteen seventy one, the body of a man was found in local Drum Creek there's the southeast of the Bender's house. And this is very key here. He'd been brained, he had his skull bashed in and had his throat cut, which, as you will see, becomes the recurring mo of this family.

00:13:58
iHeart Intro: Yep. Two more men were found shortly after, I think a few months later. A few months after that, another body was found all in the creek, and apparently they all had that same kind of mortal wound or that combination of injuries. And one of the bodies was identified as a man named William Jones, and he had been carrying known to have been carrying about two hundred and fifty dollars, which at the time was like a lot of money to today six close to it, okay, And he was going to pay off his mortgage for his homestead, which is something people did at that time too. It's another thing that made it dangerous. A lot of people were walking around with a lot of cash because they were going to buy land payoff mortgages do god knows what, and there weren't banks, so they were traveling with cash and this guy was exactly that. And there was a farmer whose land he was found on that was initially accused but they were like, I don't think it was him, so he got off but I'm sure he was like wait what what? No, it wasn't me.

00:14:59
Josh: Yeah, And the way he got off to was kind of frustrating as a like a crime enthusiast reader, because they investigated it and they found that the wagon that dropped him had a very distinctive track, that one of the back wheels was off center, and I kept waiting for that to come back as like, remember that wagon, that's what eventually led to the killers. But spoiler alert, that does not happen. So don't put a pin in it. Take the pin out of that.

00:15:29
iHeart Intro: Yeah, just take throw that pin away, break in two. So the thing about I think one of the reasons why people started getting hot under the collar about these murders too, is that this area got a really bad reputation really fast. Like it was like you avoid the spot as best you can, like maybe go out of your way to avoid this area. On the Osage Trail because people just wind up missing there and that kind of got people aware of like the whole, the whole problem that the area was facing, but they didn't know who it was, and they certainly hadn't centered on the benders. The benders just had a reputation as being odd and possibly a little maybe violently unusual, but not murderers by any stretch. They just weren't suspected for a really long time.

00:16:18
Josh: Violently unusual. Yeah, what a reputation.

00:16:22
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's pretty serious.

00:16:25
Josh: Here's another story too that you do need to get that pen out, put it back together, that you Josh told you to break an eye. Sorry everybody, and put a pin in this story because this was chronologically speaking. February eighteen seventy three, a woman who didn't really have any money apparently stopped at the home, asked to rest, asked for some food, fell asleep on a bed in the back, and then when she woke up, there was mo bender and she pointed to a table covered in pistols and knives and said, there, your supper's ready. So this lady somehow apparently manages to stay composed and not like react with alarm.

00:17:09
iHeart Intro: Like waking up fiddlesticks.

00:17:11
Josh: Yeah exactly, and said I just need to step outside for a minute to do something. Just apparently made a private excuse, is what the Kansas City Time said. Yeah, and and ran and took off, running barefoot, basically, you know, in her sleeping clothes, ran for a couple of miles to find help. And it's hard to parse together what this sentence from the Times even means, but I'm taking it to mean that it didn't. Really, it still didn't set off alarm bells for this family.

00:17:39
iHeart Intro: It didn't. And that, by the way, is a classic example of being violently unusual. Right, Okay, you know, if you're violently unusual, you have the kind of house that people run two miles away from in their bare feet.

00:17:53
Josh: Yeah, where guns and knives are presented as supper.

00:17:56
iHeart Intro: Exactly, right. So this is just kind of going along. The benders are homing along doing the murdering thing. People don't really suspect them, but the area's got a bad reputation. But there was a series of murders, actually a combo won two punch of murders that finally led to their discovery as a murder family. And the first thing started with the guy named George Newton long Core, who left Independence, Kansas, which was just to the west of Cherry Vale along the O Sage Trail, and he was on his way to Iowa, so he would have passed through Cherry Vale along with his eighteen month old daughter, Mary Anne, and he never made it to Iowa. And that caught the attention of another man, a physician named William Yorke, who was his neighbor and was concerned enough that he started traveling around inquiring about him to see if he could figure out what happened to George and his daughter mary Anne.

00:18:50
Josh: Yeah. Good neighbor, Yeah, really good neighbor, like to do such a thing to take this trip. So starts investigating, finds out that the horror wagon team was abandoned near Fort Scott, Kansas and in the spring. I mean, I think that's what led him to go out there. So he's out there in the spring, he gets to Fort Scott, all that stuff is still there. Basically all of their stuff had been abandoned. They were nowhere to be found. So he's like, something is going on. I need to go back to Independence. And then he disappears.

00:19:24
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and that really caught the attention to people because it turned out doctor William York. And if I said Edward the first time, please forgive me. His name was William, and he was a doctor, and he was a York, and there were two other Yorks. He had a brother named Edward who was neither here nor there, but he had a really important brother named Alexander York who was a colonel from the Civil War and also a Kansas senator. So they had murdered the brother of a Kansas senator who was known to be out looking around the area of Cherryvale for somebody else who had gone missing. And that really got people's antenna.

00:19:58
Josh: Yeah, big time, enough to wear They got a search party, Colonel Alexander. I think that about seventy five men set off and they were, you know, they were scouring around. They were They basically kind of figured out at one point that they definitely went by the Bender's house. So let's go by and talk to these people, see what's going on when they do this mob Bender you know, claims to not speak English, which seems like her main jam. Her big joke besides, here's your supper of guns and knives? Was I also don't speak English, Kate Young Kate says, I don't know anything about this guy, and then John Junior said, hey, listen, I was shot at when I was out there at Drum Creek where all these bodies have been found, and I can take you out there, and like, maybe the people that shot at me killed your friends as well.

00:20:50
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and again, just imagine just throw Clampet saying this and taking people out to look at a place where he claims to have been shot at. Right, Just that bit so so, but he's also just kooky. You know. Did you watch The Beverly Hillbillies? I did, like a lot.

00:21:11
Josh: Yeah, yeah, I watched it a lot.

00:21:13
iHeart Intro: So do you remember the time or the period? I guess it was a phase where Jethrow ended up becoming like a movie producer in Hollywood.

00:21:21
Josh: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was got a little weird later in that show.

00:21:24
iHeart Intro: It really did get weird. So it's not clear whether this is that Hollywood producer of Jethrow or the original mountaineer son of Jethrow. Either way, it works pretty good, but he takes Alexander and the search party out there. I guess he gave enough of an explanation and was you know, pointing out different spots well enough that they're like either they believed him or they just didn't really care, and they kind of headed on basically.

00:21:51
Josh: Yeah, I mean he showed bullet holes in a tree, or not holes, but bullet markings, which you know Kansas in the eighteen seventies, about half the tree said bullets in them. So that doesn't prove anything, but like you said, it was enough at least to sniff him slightly off the case, at least temporarily. But they came back a few days later said, listen, we heard about this lady over the past few days who came here and I don't want to really start anything, but she said that you said, here's your supper, and it.

00:22:23
iHeart Intro: Was guns and knis there's something about a pistol supper or something like.

00:22:28
Josh: That, and that's weird. She ran away barefoot for two miles and no one made a big deal out of it, But now we kind of want to know. This is where mob Bender all of a sudden starts speaking English. Apparently the quote is she flew into a violent passion and went off saying, you know that that lady was a witch and she has you know, cursed Kate's coffee that she was going to drink, and if she ever comes back here, I'm going to kill her. We got her out of here. She was a witch.

00:22:58
iHeart Intro: Yes, she converted Kate's coffee into that mushroom coffee, and now Kate refuses to drink it.

00:23:04
Josh: What's mushroom coffee?

00:23:06
iHeart Intro: It's exactly what it sounds like, exactly doesn't actually have coffee.

00:23:10
Josh: No, oh, it's made out of mushrooms.

00:23:12
iHeart Intro: Yeah, yeah, you should try it sometimes just to say you tried it.

00:23:16
Josh: Now. That's what on those survival shows. They get like roots and twigs and boil that stuff down. They're like, here's my morning coffee.

00:23:24
iHeart Intro: Coffee.

00:23:25
Josh: Have fun with that.

00:23:26
iHeart Intro: So they so again still like they were kind of like, Okay, this family's really weird, but we don't really have anything on them. But it was enough that Alexander York kind of stuck around town and they held a meeting with basically the whole town that Pa and John Junior even attended, and they said, hey, this place has a bad reputation. Something's going on. These two people at the very least have been have turned up missing. We need to just search everyone's homestead and apparently very brassly. At least one neighbor said, I've got nothing to hide, search my homestead, and Pa said the same thing. He said, I don't either, You guys search my homestead. And so I guess they kind of did a slow motion search, because it was at least a week I saw, if not a couple of weeks before they finally made it out to search the Bender's place. And when they showed up, they realized very quickly that the Benders weren't there and probably hadn't been there since the night of that meeting.

00:24:27
Josh: Yeah, when they realized, they told people to come search their house. You said, what my favorite part about Kate's jam is that they asked her to do the seance to like give some more information, like, well, if you're so good at that, and she said, now, it's like it's it's daytime. There's too many people around, Like, have you ever seen a seance? She's like, why don't you come back tomorrow night, just the two of you and we'll do one. And they were like, no, thank you, right, I think I'll take the zero in that one.

00:24:54
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, doctor, Colonel. No, Colonel, Alexander York was a sharp dudeasically.

00:25:01
Josh: Yeah, but the townspeople weren't sharp enough to go. I don't know if they were searching other places. I know there was a weather issue, but like you said, by the time they got there, they were Gonzo's. They left there. They took a train because they found their horse and wagon and even their dog just on a public street near the train station. And they got the heck out of Dodge, well not out of Dodge, out of what would become Cherryvale.

00:25:27
iHeart Intro: Very close, very close. So the volunteers were like, well, I guess since they left, we can just go ahead and go on in. And apparently they found very quickly that there was a trap door in the floor. And when they opened the trap door, I guess a lot of them gagged because it smelled like decaying human remains. And even though they looked in there and there weren't actual bodies, there was so much blood and gore in this cellar rotting that it was enough to make a person gag even without a full body decomposing. There.

00:25:59
Josh: It's a great place for our second break. Oh okay, the height of suspense.

00:26:04
iHeart Intro: Let's do it.

00:26:05
Josh: We'll be back and talk about what was making that smell right after this. All right, So they have a stone cellar under the house covered in blood and stinks like dead bodies even though there's no dead bodies. And we said we were going to get to the bottom of the smell. The bottom of it is there were dead bodies in there previously. Yeah, so they had this pretty easy.

00:26:56
iHeart Intro: They had the trap set up, the trap door set up, so it led to a hole in the cellar, and then there was a like a way outer I guess, a way in from the foundation and they would kill people, put them in the trap door through the trap door to the cellar, and they'd retrieved them at night when there weren't prying eyes around.

00:27:16
Josh: Yeah, pretty good system they had going. They started searching around. They did eventually find bodies. They found William Yorke's body buried in the orchard. They found a Lonker's body buried along with young Mary Anne, who the two gentlemen had the head wounds in the throat wounds. Maryanne, I've seen variously was either suffocated or suffocated from being buried alive man but not brained in throat slit at least tragic either way, of course, sure, but very very sad case. Eventually they would go on to find about a dozen bodies and were eventually implicated in as many as twenty one murders.

00:28:01
iHeart Intro: Yeah, they found it. Yeah, I saw eleven I think, including Mary Anne. A bunch of them were in the orchard. They looked around the property and realized that there were a bunch of depressions in the orchard, and they're like, I wonder if those are graves, And they turned up people in the graves. They found somebody in the well, and then yeah, when you add them together with all the people dumped in Drum Creek, I guess it comes to about twenty one. And they developed this theory of what had happened, in part based on some people who had narrowly escaped with their lives and hadn't realized it until after the Benders became national news. But that curtain that they had dividing the tavern, the Olie's bargain bin from the rest of the house was right behind the seat where they would have travelers and guests sit when they were eating a meal.

00:28:54
Josh: Right, Yeah, And they would have them sit there, and you know, from the other side it would you know. They would be silhouetted by the candlelight so they could see clearly where they were, and then Paw or John Junior would either use like the butt of an axe or a hammer to brain them. They would put them in the cellar and rob them and then slit their throat. And that's how it was sort of a I don't know the fact, like, all right, let's go ahead and tell the stories about the other guys. Because after this came out, people started coming forward, like you said, a guy named mister Wetzel said, hey, wait a minute. They tried to get me to sit right by that curtain and I wouldn't sit by the curtain, and mob Bender got really mad about that, and so we got the heck out of there. And then another guy named William Pickering said, yeah, I didn't want to sit by that curtain because it was dirty and gross, and I took a different seat and they got in a big fight and Kate came at me with a knife. So I don't know why they just didn't come up behind them and brain them like the Maybe the felt the curtain offered some sort of cover. It just seems very like stubborn.

00:30:05
iHeart Intro: Oh, like they had to follow procedure or else the person.

00:30:08
Josh: Yeah, like allowed you have to sit there. I'm like, well, you can't murder a guy in another chair.

00:30:13
iHeart Intro: Well I don't. Yeah, I don't think it would have been as easy to come up behind him from the from the curtain, you know what I'm saying.

00:30:19
Josh: Maybe it sounds a little I mean, I guess they got away with it for a little while, so but I don't know, it sounds a little amateurish.

00:30:28
iHeart Intro: Sure, or they were such professionals they just stuck to the script and if the script deviated it, they didn't take chances. And there's there's actually a good suggestion of why they didn't take chances, because there were later discovered in the house bullet holes in the walls and in the door frames, and that was taken to be from people who had tried to fight back when they realized what was going on. But I guess they had ultimately been unsuccessful, because nobody escaped that house saying they had shot at everyone because they tried to brain them, you know.

00:30:58
Josh: Or maybe it was just supper.

00:31:00
iHeart Intro: I guess sol pistol suffer, You're right.

00:31:03
Josh: Who knows? So the story gets out becomes, you know, for the eighteen seventies, becomes a pretty big media storm whatever that looked like back then, and that people, you know, it became like a bit of a tourist stop. Like people. It sounds like people essentially showed up there and kind of looted the place. Over time, we're just kind of, you know, breaking up pieces of the cellar and breaking up the bed frame and kind of just taking whatever they wanted with them.

00:31:32
iHeart Intro: Yeah. And one of the reasons it became such a media frenzy is they were the first serial killers in America that America ever produced, at least as far as the media could tell. A decade later, Austin would have what's frequently referred to as the first serial killer in America with the Servant Girl Annihilator, which is pre uh.

00:31:52
Josh: I don't even know if I want to do a podcast on that.

00:31:55
iHeart Intro: No, I don't know that name alone. It's like, yeah, that's all right.

00:31:59
Josh: That stopped me called. I mean, this was ten years before Jack the Ripper even right exactly.

00:32:03
iHeart Intro: And HH Holmes, who's also often referred to as America's first serial killer, he wasn't until the eighteen thirties or eighteen nineties, so he was like a good twenty years on. So it was a big deal. So not only do we have America's first serial killer, we had America's first dark tourists show up at their house and take everything they possibly could as a memento. But one of the things that happened about this being such a huge media sensation is that, like the country was following this and everyone was basically looking for the Benders because don't forget, they'd vanished. No one knew which way they went. All they knew was that somewhere not too far off, they'd ridden their wagon to that train station, and the train ticket person had said, yeah, those four people definitely bought tickets, but I can't tell you where. Yeah, And they said, they said, you can tell us, so I'm a doctor. Right.

00:32:58
Josh: They did arrest twelve men. This sounds a little bit like, hey, we've got to kind of do something. So they arrest these guys who they alleged maybe were involved as far as receiving stolen goods, because they never really found a super clear motive. I mean, it seemed like a lot of them may have had like traveling money, or like the guy who had the two hundred and fifty bucks, which was a lot of money at the time, but it was never like one hundred percent established, like their motive was just to rob people. But they implicated these twelve guys as guys who may have helped them move stolen items and money and stuff like that. And apparently one of the guys was a member of a vigilanti committee who tried to get on to help lead the investigation with Colonel Yorke, but was denied and rejected, and I think that kind of hurt his feelings. And I think what it came down to was these guys, they were known as the regulators, these vigilanties. They were throat cutters. They would cut people's throat instead of like bringing them back to face trial. And then they just sort of tied it to these people because of the throat cutting.

00:34:05
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and a lot of pretty innocent a lot of well a lot of innocent people died as a result. So these people were bad dudes. But I saw that it was more than just the throat cutting, that there was a way that they would particularly leave bodies like you. They would put the right hand against the right breast and the left hand down like just by their side.

00:34:25
Josh: Like a pledge of allegiance.

00:34:26
iHeart Intro: Almost, but you're you're like as if you don't know which side of your chest to put your hand and you got it wrong, kind of like that. And apparently they found a lot of the bodies in the orchard at the Bender's place posed like this basically almost like this was this is the sign, like this is what this gang did. So I don't think they were like in the gang, but it's possible that gang of vigilantes were fencing this stuff for them, and that they were at least tangentially related.

00:34:56
Josh: You know, sure, it's possible. Sure, when it comes down to who these people really were, we're not exactly sure. There's been a lot of modern investigation about who they were, and they think that Ma was a woman named Almira Meek and was from upstate New York near the Adirondack Mountains, so not German at all. There were some pretty sketchy accounts, not super well researched, that said she had been married before and that her husbands had all met violent deaths from head wounds. So, you know, I don't know if that's just the internet running with something, or if that's true.

00:35:38
iHeart Intro: Apparently, out of all of the four, the Ma and Kate seemed to have actually been related, although I don't know how. I didn't see how did.

00:35:48
Josh: You like how they were related?

00:35:52
iHeart Intro: No? No, no, like they were supposed to be mother and daughter. But how did how did that ever get turned up? Like? Where was that? How was that ever defined?

00:36:00
Josh: I think just people doing like modern research on lineage and stuff like that. Okay, because they think they turned up her original name too, that Ma was married to a man named Griffith, and that Kate was really Eliza Griffith.

00:36:13
iHeart Intro: Okay.

00:36:14
Josh: John Senior apparently was John Flickinger and was either from Germany or the Netherlands. And then John Junior apparently israel name was the alias that he was using that I said to put up in in John Gerhart.

00:36:29
iHeart Intro: And now you can take that pin out and break in half and throw it away.

00:36:33
Josh: Yeah. So if he was using his real name as an alias, then I'm not sure what was going on with John Jr.

00:36:40
iHeart Intro: No, No, he's a Jettro type, don't forget. So there were people who are like, oh, we've seen the benders. Who saw the benders here, they went this way, they went that away for years and years and years. It was like like people would would report on their whereabouts, and it's unclear to this day whether people did or didn't know where they went. I saw there was one kind of article I guess from the time that was basically like, yeah, everybody knows where they are and there's just nothing anyone can do. They made it to another state and everybody just kind of leaves everybody else alone out there. Other people have always reported like, no, they have no idea where they went. They just kind of vanished in the thin air. And then there were reports that were usually incorrect, that they'd either been captured or that they'd been killed, or there was one report that Pod died by suicide in Lake Michigan in eighteen eighty four.

00:37:36
Josh: Right Another one said John Junior and Kate went to New Mexico like sort of Texas New Mexico border and John died of a stroke. Some people said that vigilantes got them and they burned Kate alive and shot and killed the other ones and buried him in the prairies, but no one ever claimed the substantial reward, you know, close to seventy grand today, So it seems like none of these stories were probably true, or maybe who knows, maybe one of them was. It's just no way to know.

00:38:11
iHeart Intro: So Laura Ingalls Wilder actually had a family story that I read that her daughter basically said, hey, you should weave this into our family story. So it's almost certainly not true. That she and her family, on their way to homestead passed by the Bender's tavern, but they didn't have enough money to go in for food or to stay there, but they settled in a close enough area that after the Benders were found out her father, there was a knock on her family's door and her father was summoned outside with his gun and he didn't come back till morning. But that anytime you ever asked him about the Benders, he would say, they'll never be found again. Right again, this isn't true. And one of the other things that really undermines the Vigilanti theories again, seventy thousand and today's dollars was offered as a reward. Somebody from that group of Vigilanes would have stepped up and taken it, or even if they didn't, how could a group of vigilanes keep that secret for all that time? That it's still to this day, never came out because that would be something to boast about that you were among the group of vigilanes that caught and killed the bloody benders, you know. Sure, So I think the vigilane thing is get.

00:39:23
Josh: A book deal at the very least for sure these days. I think it's the kind of thing where a lot of Kansas Citianites know about it. You know, they celebrated Bender Days for a while. They had a replica at Cherry Vale at one point of the Bendor House. More recently, in fact, just a couple of years ago, a gentleman named Bob Miller, who was a financial advisor from Independence and a historian and who knows maybe a bit of a murder junkie, bought the land and basically said, like, Hey, the people that own this land never did anything with it. They never searched for the location of the murder sites or the house, and I want to do that. I want to like have like professional expert investigations done on the property. I don't know if he plans to put up like a Lizzie boardenhouse or something, but he wants to get to the bottom of what he can, at.

00:40:22
iHeart Intro: Least right Yeah, he said he's going to try to get with UK or K state. I don't remember which one to do, like ground penetrating surveys, But I don't know what his endgame is either. But it's pretty neat that he bought it, And one of the reasons why he's feeling good about finding something is the family that he bought it from owned the land for like the last sixty five previous years, and they showed zero interest whatsoever in finding the actual site, and they just turned it all into crop land. So there's a good chance that there's something like the foundation, maybe even that gastro seller the well that the one guy was found in remnants of the orchard. Who knows, there could be plenty of stuff left there. I don't know if they're gonna I believe they exhumed all of the bodies that they found, but that's not to say that they found everybody.

00:41:08
Josh: You know, Yeah, absolutely. There was a movie made in twenty sixteen called Bender that does not look great. Did you see the trailer?

00:41:19
iHeart Intro: I know, I didn't. I just saw. Livia quoted a user from IMDb that said it had some of the worst acting I've ever seen.

00:41:26
Josh: What was the trailer like uh not, I mean, it didn't look great. I read some other reviews that said it was okay, but it wasn't like U super murdery or super scary, so it kind of fell too much toward like historical drama.

00:41:44
iHeart Intro: They talked a lot about like raising in harvesting grain.

00:41:48
Josh: Maybe I don't know, but there was a thing that in Red Dead Redemption two that is funny because I kind of forgot about this. I played that game a couple of years ago, and there's a pig farm where your character shows up and there's a creepy old lady and a creepy old man and they're like trying to get you to stay for dinner. And apparently it's modeled after this, and you don't really know, and you know, when you're in those games, you don't know quite what to do, Like I feel like I should leave. It's kind of like real life. But they offer you libations, and you need libations. So if you just I don't all right, If you want to play this game and you haven't, it's pretty old, don't listen to this part. But if you don't care, like most people, don't drink the drink because as soon as you drink the drink, the screen goes woozy, and you wake up the next day, and I'm not sure that good things happened overnight.

00:42:44
iHeart Intro: Okay, but you're not dead.

00:42:46
Josh: Huh, you're not dead.

00:42:48
iHeart Intro: That's not very bendery, No, it's not.

00:42:51
Josh: I think they were inspired by the Vendors a little bit, but I don't know supposedly.

00:42:55
iHeart Intro: Also, I've never read American Gods, the Neil game and book. Have you? Have you read any of his stuff?

00:43:01
Josh: Never have.

00:43:01
iHeart Intro: I've read some of his short stories and they're amazing, so I'm surprised I've never read his novels. But in American Gods, one of the characters is a Slavic god named Zunborg, so that I'm going with. And every time the Benders killed somebody, he gained strength from their sacrifice, which is a pretty neat little take on the whole thing. You know, because we're so like we have the blinders on here on Earth, we don't even realize this murder family is actually contributing to the well being of a Slavic god.

00:43:31
Josh: I thought you were going to say, whenever they killed someone, they would yell Zunberg.

00:43:36
iHeart Intro: Well they did that. Too, but that was never captured in the articles from the time, Chuck, which, by the way, if you're like I need to know more about the bloody Benders, and I will not have it filtered through history. I need the original stuff. There's a website called Genealogytrails dot com and if you search that and Bender Family and your favorite search engine, it will bring up the crime related news articles from the time about the Bender family. And it's awesome because it has a bunch of other details. But also it's got like that old timey nineteenth century you know, crime reporting too write It's just worth reading, for sure.

00:44:11
Josh: It's always fun.

00:44:12
iHeart Intro: You got anything else about the Benders?

00:44:14
Josh: Nothing else?

00:44:15
iHeart Intro: Well, that said about the Benders for now everybody. And since Chuck said nothing else, that means it's time for a listener. Man.

00:44:25
Josh: Hey, guys, stumbled across you in the summer of twenty twenty when I was employed as a USPS Rural Carrier associate, not a rural juror. I heard it.

00:44:38
iHeart Intro: Wait wait, now, I need to know what was that. I can't remember what that's.

00:44:41
Josh: From thirty Rock.

00:44:44
iHeart Intro: I still can't place it, but I'll think about it and I'll say Eureka later.

00:44:47
Josh: Okay, well, what's funny is after we talked a little bit about thirty Rock on our Sitcoms episode and Emily went out of town for a week and I barreled through season one of thirty Rock while she was gone, and it was so good.

00:45:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, just really do it again.

00:45:04
Josh: What a show god. Alec Baldwin Yeah, and Tracy Morgan Yeah.

00:45:09
iHeart Intro: And don't forget Liz Lemon.

00:45:10
Josh: She was great. But uh oh boy, Baldwin and Tracy Morgan just slavey on the show. I mean, everyone on that show was really funny.

00:45:17
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Tracy Morgan's best quote was somebody offered him cash who's and he said, I'm glad you said that, because I thought it was a bowl of baby penises.

00:45:28
Josh: His other a good one that I got was you're talking about how they go together, like peanut butter, and he said, or like chicken and the chicken container.

00:45:39
iHeart Intro: That's pretty good. So.

00:45:41
Josh: Rural Juror though, was the movie that Jane Krakowski was in, and the joke is she goes Rure Duror and like, no one knows what the title of the movie. He is, but it had gone so long they couldn't really ask her, uh, what the name of the movie was.

00:45:56
iHeart Intro: I don't.

00:45:57
Josh: I mean, I'm gonna keep watching it. She's so funny too, however, okay, all right, back to the email. I have heard a podcasts before, but never gave it much thought until a friend insisted started to listen to some and they got to the point of stuff you should Know, where I'd talk to some much about y'all. My husband finally came and said, who the Hecker Josh and Chuck, and when you're going to introduce me to your new friends? But now the show is our go to for family road trips.

00:46:22
iHeart Intro: Awesome.

00:46:23
Josh: One neat thing I wanted to write about, though, was my last dental appointment in February. I decided to bring along earbuds so I could listen to y'all while getting some feelings done. I asked the dentist and the assistant if it would be okay to listen to the podcast while they work, and the dentist said it was okay, but asked me what I was going to listen to first. I told her it was stuff you should Know and how much I enjoyed it. And I was listening to the Chowchilla Bus kidnapping episode. My dentist lit up and told me how awesome that episode was. Her assistant had never heard of the show, but the dentist was happily talking about your show so much that my entire visit I didn't get to listen to the episode because I was half chatting to my dentist about stuff. You should know.

00:47:06
iHeart Intro: That's awesome.

00:47:07
Josh: Thank you for saving me while I was delivering people's mail, and for keeping company during my commutes with love from the Land of ten Thousand Lakes. That is Tanya Vanderpool from Texas. Ten thousand Lakes, Texas has like two lakes.

00:47:24
iHeart Intro: What is that Minnesota? Minnesota?

00:47:28
Josh: Yeah, right, a thousand lakes.

00:47:30
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it's gotta be Michigan. No, Minnesota, Yeah, it's Minnesota for sure. She really didn't say, you're not toying with me.

00:47:39
Josh: I don't know. I mean, I'm saying I'm not toying with you, but I'm also on the verge of saying so many things that are wrong about lakes and states that I'm just stopping.

00:47:48
iHeart Intro: That's fine, that's fine, But can you imagine the audacity of just signing off with the Land of ten Thousand Lakes and not putting in parentheses. What state you're talking about?

00:47:59
Josh: I mean, I like my email's Chuck of the Peach State.

00:48:03
iHeart Intro: Okay, well that is pretty audacious. Chuck, it's violently unusual.

00:48:08
Josh: What was the person's name again, Minnesota?

00:48:14
iHeart Intro: You're in fine form today, aren't you. You're being playful.

00:48:17
Josh: I'm kidding. It was Tanya Vanderpool.

00:48:19
iHeart Intro: Okay, thanks a lot, Tanya. We appreciate that, and we're glad we can keep you company and that we made your dentist's appointment so special. If you want to get in touch with us like Tanya did and tell us about your dental visits, why not, You can send it in an email to Stuff podcast at iHeartRadio dot com.
