00:00:01
iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:11
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, just cracking us up. And this is stuff you should know.

00:00:20
iHeart Intro: That's right. Kind of a rare detailed war battle episode.

00:00:25
Josh: Yeah, we don't do a lot of war stuff.

00:00:28
iHeart Intro: Yeah, a little bit here and there.

00:00:30
Josh: A little here there. Yeah, but usually it's like some crazy commando story like you're right, you know, and usually where the Nazis are getting beat up because we love that narrative.

00:00:39
iHeart Intro: Yeah, we usually don't like, say, hey, let's dive into some specific battles of the Crimean War.

00:00:45
Josh: Right, But for all of you fans of the Crimean War who didn't look at the title, you're like, oh, I know what this one's about. Of course, it's about the Charge of the Light Brigade. And if you were an English student, sorry and English student and you studied poetry, you're probably familiar with the poem The Charge of the Light Brigade by Alfred Kama Lord Tennyson. I think you're supposed to say the comm out lab from what I understand, Yeah, like the colon, but that was a real deal that really happened, and it's a really complicated, complex story that's also extremely fascinating and totally nuts at the end.

00:01:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, So I guess we should probably set up a little bit about just what the Crimean War was.

00:01:32
Josh: Yeah.

00:01:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah, So the Crimean War was over the course of a few years from eighteen fifty three to fifty six. It was in Europe, fought between Russia and Britain, France, and Turkey, which was part of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey was that is, and it was known for a lot of things. There were some you know, interesting people that came out of this ended up being super famous, and a lot of lives lost, but notably, most of the half a million lives lost, like maybe as many as seventy five percent died from disease and things like that instead of on the battlefield.

00:02:09
Josh: Yeah, which is terrible. That was a reason that two now famous women showed up to help. One was Florence Nightingale, who was very well known as the Lady with the Lamp. She showed up and started using like evidence based treatments and apparently the mortality rate at these horrible field hospitals went from forty one percent when she showed up down to two percent at the end of the war. It's pretty impressive. And then there's a less well known woman named Mary Secole who was born in Jamaica. She was mixed race, and she appealed to be sent to the Crimean Front, like Florence Nightingale, was was turned down. So she went herself and showed up and made huge, huge gains and saving lives there as well.

00:02:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and it was the first big war covered by the press. Notably, Tolstoy got to start there, you know, writing about the you know, dispatches from the front basically, right. It's also weirdly where the black lava comes from. That, you know, the what we in America might call a ski mask or a scary mask, or a scary mask or a cat burglar mask, it comes from here. So lots of sort of little weird things. And obviously, like you mentioned the Charge of the Light Brigade, the very famous poem. But the whole thing started over a religious argument basically in the Ottoman Empire, wherein for several years the French Catholics were battling it out with the Russian Orthodox Church over who controlled the holy sites the Christian holy sites within the Ottoman Empire, which really ticked off Zar Nicholas the First.

00:03:51
Josh: Yeah, so he also we should say the Ottoman Empire was very powerful for a while, but we're joining them at the twilight, maybe even the end of their empire, which I think broke up in World War One, and this is about sixty years before that. So the Ottoman Empire was not in a very good position to defend itself against our Nicholas the First, who's like, oh, yeah, well, I'm going to invade part of your Ottoman Empire, and I'm going to invade what's in modern day Romania, Moldavia and Wallachia, which is where Dracula is from. And he invaded, and again the Ottoman Empire, I think they were known as the sick man of Europe. There was not a lot they can do about it. So France and Britain came to their aid, and not for any necessarily altruistic reason, but because they were not happy with the idea of Russian expanding itself into Europe and in particular getting a foothold in the Mediterranean. And when they set up shop in Wallachia and Moldavia, they were on the Danube, which would take them straight to the Mediterranean. So France and Britain became concerned and they're like, well, back you up, Ottoman Empire.

00:05:01
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it's boy. The more things changed, the more they say the same.

00:05:05
Josh: Yeah, it's true. Man.

00:05:06
iHeart Intro: It's crazy when you see this stuff that happened back in the eighteen fifties and you can draw sort of a straight line to the things that happened today in Russian expansion. It's just really interesting stuff.

00:05:16
Josh: Yeah.

00:05:17
iHeart Intro: But all that to say is that what is now, like you said, modern day Romania. He now occupied France and Britain got their hackles up. They sent warships to the Black Sea in eighteen fifty three, declared war on Russian in eighteen fifty four, and the first big you know, this could have ended at all, The first big major defeat against that English and French alliance was at Odessa. They're in the Black Sea and Czar Nicholas withdrew basically that land he had occupied. He pulled back out in July of eighteen fifty four, and that could have been the end of it. But the Frenchies and the Brits said, you know what, now we want to punish them for their aggression. So we're going to go on the offensive. And that turned out to be a bit of a boondoggle.

00:06:06
Josh: It did. Nations do that kind of thing though, when, especially when they soundly defeat an expansionist nation, they often want to make an example of be like, don't try that again. This is not like completely out of left field, but yeah, the way it turned out was not great. And they chose to invade Russia by landing on the Crimean Peninsula. And they chose Crimea for a couple of reasons. One it's where Russia's naval ships were stationed that they would use to take over the Mediterranean if they could get a foothold there. And then two, they couldn't make it to mainland Russia because Germany was neutral at the time. They were the Austro Prussian I guess Kingdom. They're like, you can't send your troops through here to get to Russia. They're like, okay, we'll go attack Crimea. And then there was one other thing about Crimea, chuck. It offered a way to attack navally, which is what the Brits favored, and it also offered, at the same time a way to attack on land, which is what the French preferred, and so surf and turf exactly. It was the surf and turf strategy. And yeah, the Crimean Peninsula served all of those purposes.

00:07:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, which was mainland Ukraine by the way. So I guess the first battle, or oh, not the first battle. I guess this would be the second battle we're talking about, and the one that really sets up the story of the Charge of the Light Brigade is the siege of You know, in California, there's a town called Sebastopol with a B.

00:07:37
Josh: Yeah, my aunt lives there in Sebastopol.

00:07:40
iHeart Intro: H It's quite nice. It is lovely wooded northern California. Yes, I've been there myself.

00:07:47
Josh: Okay, but this is with a V.

00:07:49
iHeart Intro: And I don't know if it's probably not pronounced Sebastopol. It's probably Sebastopole, would be my guess.

00:07:54
Josh: Oh you know what, I've never heard anybody say it like that, but I'll bet you're right. I'll bet a bunch of Ukrainians just stood up and went.

00:08:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I wonder if there was any connection there too. I was going to look that up.

00:08:06
Josh: Surely there's got to be a heck of a coincidence.

00:08:09
iHeart Intro: I agree.

00:08:10
Josh: Somebody just put a bunch of letters together. They're like Sebastopol also.

00:08:15
iHeart Intro: The name of a good solo album by j Ferrar of Uncle Tuplo and Sunbolt.

00:08:19
Josh: Is Sebastopol nice with a B or a V with a b Okay, wait, did you say B or V because they rhyme.

00:08:27
iHeart Intro: B is in boy. Do we need to get back to the topic at hand, V as in boy? All right, it's September eighteen fifty four. We've got a little over sixty thousand troops total from this alliance, thirty thousand from the French, about twenty six thousand British troops and about forty five hundred Turks. They land on the coast of Crimea and start to hike inland for the Turf section thirty miles in and that port city of Sebastpol is where they're headed.

00:09:04
Josh: Yeah, so that's I think that's where the Russians had their there that navy that they would invade the Mediterranean with, and the Russian commander was again named Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menschikov.

00:09:16
iHeart Intro: Great name. Russians have great names.

00:09:18
Josh: Right, there was I think an initial skirmish after they landed at Kalameda Bay, but it didn't really count as the first battle. The first battle was the Battle of the Alma River, and that's where Menschikov decided like, okay, this is where we're going to start to take on this alliance force. And they It was a pretty serious battle. I think both sides lost many thousands of men, but the Brits and the French were not turned back. The Russians retreated instead.

00:09:48
iHeart Intro: That's right, And this is when a really interesting decision comes about. They were worried that there were more Russian armies coming in to that, you know, port city to help defend their navy, guess, and so they said, all right, here's what we're going to do. We're going to do the old hook and ladder and we're going to take a wide path around the city so we can attack from the south. What they didn't know was that at that time it was very poorly defended there. So if they would have if they would have just kept charging forward, it probably would have been over pretty quickly. But since they took the long way around, which they thought was a decent strategy, that gave the Russians the chance to refortify basically and stock up with men and supplies.

00:10:30
Josh: Yeah, and they couldn't have known that the city wasn't very well defended, but everybody had fled and apparently they sunk a bunch of ships in the harbor to keep the British navy from being able to land there.

00:10:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, but in part of war trying to know that stuff.

00:10:47
Josh: Yes, and ironically you would use the light Brigade for that kind of stuff, to scout and spy and report back.

00:10:56
iHeart Intro: Okay. So when you said they couldn't have known, what you really meant was they did no because they didn't do it good.

00:11:02
Josh: That's yes, Yes, Okay, you're right. So for the siege of Sevestopol, not just the Russians set up and refortified the city. The British basically regrouped and they settled at a port town called Balaklava, and it's about ten miles south of Sevastopol. And like you said, that's where the head gear comes from, or the name of it, because it actually doesn't just come from that town, it comes from this actual battle that happened there. So there's a road between Balaklava and Sevastopol, and they are because they're connected. Both sides need that for supplies, right, Yeah, So it's a really strategically important road. And before the Brits could try to take the road or secure it, the Russians decided to and they made a really risky move. They took some of their troops who were battling because by this time the Brits and the French were now laying siege to Sevastopol and the Russians were fighting them off. And the Russians took some of their troops and moved them around the Siegers and put them squarely between the Alliance forces sieging Sevastopol and the Alliance forces at Balaklava on the road to try to take the road. It was a risky move, but it was also what they had to do to kind of cut the Brits off, the sieging Brits off from supplies ten miles south at Balaklava.

00:12:31
iHeart Intro: That's right. So they attack these artillery positions of the Allieds on the hills outside of Balaklava. It turned into a pretty chaotic battle scene there, and the Russians did pretty good at first. They had a lot of cavalry. They had a pretty substantial infantry there and they captured these gun positions, these Turkish and British gun positions on that hilltop and this is a place called Cosway Heights. They tried next to take another town called Catechuoy, and that was basically the last the last stop before you got to Balaklava. But this is where the Scots come in. The legendary ninety third Sutherland Highlanders wearing kilts with swords and rifles underwear. Yeah, I mean that's the most you know, intimidating part of all of this.

00:13:25
Josh: Sure.

00:13:26
iHeart Intro: They were led by Major General Sir Colin Campbell, and he had a pretty good idea to defeat these guys and it worked.

00:13:33
Josh: Yeah. Normally the Highlanders would form a square of four rows, right, and you're able to defend your flank a lot easier. There's less men exposed in steag Campbell said we're going to form two lines, and they were like this is mind blowing. So there were more men exposed, but they were able to shoot further across, right.

00:13:52
iHeart Intro: Yeah, just bullets basically.

00:13:55
Josh: Yeah, exactly. And it turned out that the the Highlanders were successful in attacking the Russian cavalry. I'm sorry. The Highlanders were standing the ground to defend Katakhoi, and it was the Russian cavalry that was rushing at them. The Highlanders fired on them. There was a volley of of musket or bullets, I guess, and the Russians were like, oh no, and they turned left. And when they turned left, they exposed their flank, and the Highlanders fired again and really just messed the Russian cavalry up and just caused disarray and they had to retreat. So it was a really good stand, so much so that like these guys, like you said, they're legendary now in part because of this battle. And I guess I should probably say, I think i'm am I saying cavalry cavalry.

00:14:43
iHeart Intro: I think you're probably accidentally saying cavalry, which I do all the time too. But that's where Jesus was crucified, right.

00:14:49
Josh: Right, So cavalry is the horseback troops.

00:14:54
iHeart Intro: They should really have named those things two completely different sounding yes, exactly, very confusing. And the only reason I even know is because there's a lot of old hymns, church hymns that I sang that that you sing about cavalry.

00:15:08
Josh: Oh yeah, I know all about that.

00:15:10
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Did you sing hymns.

00:15:13
Josh: Not about cavalry? The Catholics don't pay attention to that for some reason.

00:15:18
Chuck: You know.

00:15:18
iHeart Intro: I just didn't know how much Catholics sang in church.

00:15:21
Josh: Oh dude, I don't even know if you can call it singing unless it's kind of like a Reformists seventies hippie church. It's chanting, okay, and it scares the Jesus out of non Catholics who like, go with a friend to a Catholic mass. It freaks people out.

00:15:39
iHeart Intro: I got you because in Baptist churches it was just the big, bombastic sort of you know, hymnal songs. Sure, sure, yeah, maybe maybe more fun, but I don't know than chanting. Yeah, but I never chanted.

00:15:55
Josh: Well, you used to try it sometime.

00:15:56
iHeart Intro: All right, I'll give it a shot. Where do we leave that The Scott's the Highlanders won And did you did you say that that's where we got the term the thin red line.

00:16:06
Josh: No, No, I didn't mention that.

00:16:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah. So you know, we talked about this being one of the first major wars where there was journalism going on, and those a guy named William Howard Russell.

00:16:17
Josh: Was he Irish, I think, yeah, he was an Irish correspondent.

00:16:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, so he was riding from the front lines and in the Times he described the line of men that you know, those two lines of men and their brick red coats. Is the a thin red streak tipped with steel and that eventually morphed into the Thin Red Line, which is another weird sort of thing that came out of this war.

00:16:39
Josh: Yeah, and another really hardcore war movie, too, Good One or no, I'm thinking of Big Red One.

00:16:46
iHeart Intro: No, no, no, The Thin Red Line was Terrence Mallock. They're both the war movies.

00:16:50
Josh: Okay, but I was thinking of the is it Big Red One?

00:16:53
Chuck: Yeah?

00:16:54
iHeart Intro: That was that was good too. Mark Hamill and the guy from Revenge of the Nerds.

00:16:57
Josh: Yeah, I think Mark Hamill gets his testicles own off by a grenade.

00:17:02
iHeart Intro: Somebody does. I think? I said before that was the first rated movie I saw on at theater, And yeah, that was it. Mark Hamill's testicles.

00:17:10
Josh: I believe it was. But I could just be making that part up.

00:17:13
iHeart Intro: I gotcha.

00:17:14
Josh: Hey, So one more thing before we go to break, because I can sense that coming on. This is the this is the first war as far as I know where. Some soldiers' wives traveled with them to the front and basically like set up a household there. It was a very bizarre setup, and they were very unhappy there because it was not a fun place to be. Yeah, but they were there to support their husbands. A lot of them were.

00:17:41
iHeart Intro: Wow, man crime me and work who knew? Yeah, all right, well we'll be right back right.

00:17:46
Chuck: Yes, all right, softly jaw.

00:18:10
Josh: Soft, all right. So I feel like we've kind of been dancing around this whole light brigade thing, and for a long time, until I started researching this for this episode, I just assumed light as in like a bright light or something like that.

00:18:29
iHeart Intro: Oh interesting, Okay, it makes way.

00:18:31
Josh: More sense now that what you're talking about is a light brigade.

00:18:35
iHeart Intro: Right, like weight weight wise sort of, yeah.

00:18:38
Josh: Rather than as opposed to a heavy brigade, both of which are part of the cavalry that the Brits and the French used at the time. Yeah.

00:18:48
iHeart Intro: And when I said weight wise, I meant, you know, lighter horses, faster horses, presumably lighter men on those horses. I imagine it was just a bunch of people that were fleet to poot and horses that were fleet of hoof. Their job if you were a light brigade was to ride very quickly across the battlefield, to move places with great speed, sometimes to deliver battle orders with great speed. The heavy brigade is exactly what you would think. Bigger horses, bigger men, close combat, breaking through enemy lines, kind of kicking button, taking names.

00:19:23
Josh: Yeah, and so like when the heavy brigade broke up the enemy line is like the enemy was retreating, you'd send in the light brigade, who would chase the enemy down and slash them with their swords and stuff.

00:19:33
iHeart Intro: Right, yeah, they probably had better hair in the light brigades.

00:19:36
Josh: They probably did, you.

00:19:38
iHeart Intro: Know, like the handsome like all right, now all the rough stuff's done, get us in here a fleet.

00:19:44
Josh: Horses with their habsburg chins.

00:19:47
iHeart Intro: Oh totally.

00:19:48
Josh: So there was in addition to the charge of the light brigade at this So we're at the Battle of Balaklava still, this is where all of this happens. Right, Remember that the Highlanders already turned back the Russian caval once. Now that heavy brigade is actually sent in. Their charge of the heavy heavy brigade came before the charge of the light Brigade, and I think it was pretty effective when they when they hit up the Russians. I think there were eight hundred horsemen in the heavy brigade running into three thousand Russians in the Russian line.

00:20:25
iHeart Intro: Yeah, but it's the heavy brigade, so they did a lot of damage the Russian cavalry. Now it's in my head. They kind of scrambled to get out of there. And here's where we get to a point where there's a sort of a fateful, confusing order that brings us to the actual Light Brigade story. And we're going to introduce some people here, none of whom seem to be very competent at warring. So basically people like you and I would have been.

00:20:58
Josh: Yeah, imagine if we were rich and said I want to be a lieutenant. I'm going to pay to be a lieutenant in the Army of command soldiers.

00:21:07
iHeart Intro: That was the thing.

00:21:08
Josh: That's exactly what these men had done. With the exception of Lord Raglan, he had battle experience. He had fought Napoleon at Waterloo. He lost an arm in that battle, so he was a war hero. But he was twenty five when that happened, and by this time he was sixty five, a little dotty maybe he apparently remember there was a French English alliance that was battling the Russians. But when he would refer to the French, say strategically they were talking about what the French were doing, he'd refer to them as the enemy. That was very confusing. And this battle, the Battle of Balaklava, was the first time that he had ever led, like commanded men in battle. Up to that point, he'd been subordinate. This was the first time he was the one calling the shots for the battle, so he had the most experience, and this was the first time he was.

00:22:01
iHeart Intro: Doing yeah, for sure. So he gets up on this high about a six hundred foot high ridge, so he's got a great view of the battlefield. The guys down there don't have any kind of view at all. So the orders are going to be getting maybe a little bit confusing because they can't really see what's going on, like Raglan can. He's also pretty far away, so it takes twenty minutes to get even with the light Horse brigade, Yeah, or the light Runner who will meet in a minute too. Who hates everybody that's involved here as it turns out it takes him about twenty minutes to get there and deliver an order, and you know, presumably a little bit of time to sort of suss that out, and then another twenty minutes to come back. So it's probably like forty minutes to an hour for this whole exchange of information to take place. And what Raglin is trying to do is trying to stop the enemy from taking away these heavy guns that they had captured at that Causeway Heights battle, and so he sends the following order. Lord Ragland wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front, follow the enemy and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troup horse artillery may accompany French cavalry as on your left immediate. Okay, a little vague, that's that's the message. A little bit vague.

00:23:22
Josh: Yeah, So that's problem one. It's vague. Problem two is, like you said, Ragland's up six hundred feet with a bird's eye view of everything going on, and the two men who received this order, the Earl of Luken George Bingham, and the Earl of Cardigan, James Brudenell, they're down in one of the valleys, so they can't see these captured guns that Ragland's talking about. And when this man who you said hated everybody, showed up, Captain Lewis Nolan, they're like, wait, what's going on? What are you talking about? And before we get into that, we should probably talk a little bit about Bingham and bruden because we kind of disparaged them a little bit, and I think we should explain why.

00:24:04
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean you mentioned being able to pay for a position. That's what both of these guys did. They paid for this position of leading these men. They were both wealthy gentlemen. I believe Brudenelle, the Earl of Cardigan, was described at one point as brave, handsome, bad tempered, and brainless. And these guys were brothers in law who hated each other's guts. So Cardigan was a subordinate to Lucan and didn't like being under his command. And like you said, this guy Nolan didn't like either one of them. He said, and these are quotes he said, we call Lucan the cautious ass and Lord Cardigan the dangerous ass. And Lord Cardigan has as much brains as his boot. So no respect seemingly is happening for these dudes down there leading these charges.

00:24:51
Josh: No one other thing that balaklava hedgear came out of this battle. So did the Cardigan sweater.

00:24:59
iHeart Intro: Now don't know whether or not it is legit. I are eighteen to believe.

00:25:03
Josh: Totally get that. I totally get that. This is one of those things where it's like, no, I'm joking, this is true. It's named after James Brudenell, the Earl of Cardigan, I think the seventh Earl of Cardigan.

00:25:12
iHeart Intro: Because I almost looked that up, but I just ran out of time because we're recording early and I had a hunch, but I didn't get to it. So you're not pulling my my ski.

00:25:22
Josh: Rope, No, your rope trauma rope, my rope drama.

00:25:27
iHeart Intro: All right, Well, another little crimean warfact. I like that.

00:25:30
Josh: And one other thing about George Bingham, the Earl of Luken. He made his money by as a landlord for poor Irish tenant farmers. Yeah, and then would evict them and send them to the poorhouse when they couldn't pay rent. He was not a good guy at all, but that's how he became wealthy enough to buy his position as a commander of the brigade the cavalry.

00:25:50
iHeart Intro: I guess, right, all right, so no one delivers this order. He's, like, we said, a pretty fast rider on that horse. He gets there pretty quickly. We don't know. This is where things get a little confusing. We don't know if he had other motives because he didn't like these guys. He also was in the light brigade and he wanted to see some action and at that Battle of the Alma River didn't get any action. And I think he was even frustrated because Lucan had orders to dispatch the light brigade. It didn't take it. Like these guys wanted to see action, they wanted to be heroes on the battlefield. So he gets down there to deliver this message. They're looking around, going a light what guns are you talking about? And he basically just says over there, He points at the end of the valley and said, there, my lord, is your enemy. These there are your guns, which was not the correct direction to point.

00:26:44
Josh: No, he was pointing at a heavily fortified Russian gun position right there are apparently like thirty or forty cannons there. And what again Raglan was talking about were some poorly defended captured artillery guns elsewhere, right, I think they were on one of the sides. So when he pointed, he was pointing to the center of three heavily fortified Russian positions on a I think a ridge overlooking a valley, and basically said, Raglan is telling you to charge the lightpergade. This isn't even a job for a lightpergate, but you and the lightpergate are supposed to charge straight to those Russian guns in the middle of this horribly dangerous place for you guys to be. Let's go.

00:27:32
iHeart Intro: That's right. And we don't know why he did that. We don't know if he was confused. We didn't know if he was doing it on purpose because he hated these guys. We don't know if he was doing it on purpose because he wanted that action. We don't know all this stuff. Because the guy who got the message wrong was one of the first people killed during this charge, which is not funny. I'm not laughing, but it's just I mean, this was known as sort of a war folly by the end of it, even though as we'll see, it didn't turn out to be a complete loss.

00:28:02
Josh: No, I know, we haven't gotten to the Light Brigade, the actual charge yet, but should we take a break.

00:28:08
iHeart Intro: Now, Yeah, I think it fits the act structure.

00:28:12
Josh: Sorry everybody, we'll be right back.

00:28:32
Chuck: Stuffing jaw stoff you.

00:28:44
iHeart Intro: All right. So now we're finally at the light Brigade charge. It was not supposed to happen that way. Again, it was a misunderstood or misdelivered at least order and Lucan and Cardigan didn't know they had six hundred seventy cavalrymen in this light brigade. One of the most famous blunders in military history. They said basically, all right, let's do this thing, and they went charging through what was known as the Valley of Death.

00:29:14
Josh: Yeah, and there was no one there who was like, oh, okay, that's this is a good idea, let's do this. But they didn't question the orders. So when they entered this Valley of Death, that's why I think Tennyson called it later right, Yeah, they were again charging right for Russian cannon straight ahead, and then there were Russian artillery positions on either side, and they're running right through this and right when they start riding through the the this Valley of Death, they just start getting fired upon. They're fired upon from all three directions, although apparently not all at the same time, but still like this was a it was essentially a suicide mission that they'd just been sent on and it just went badly immediate.

00:30:01
iHeart Intro: Yeah, they were people that survived it, and they said that limbs were being shot off, heads were being shot off, Horses were running around without people on them, or with just bodies on them, without heads. There was so much smoke. Apparently one soldier said it was like riding into the mouth of a volcano. That the heavy brigade it was going so badly. The heavy brigade was supposed to follow. It was kind of reversed, I guess, and Lucan said, no, he pulled those orders back and pulled back the heavy brigade even.

00:30:32
Josh: He said, they have sacrificed the light brigade. That shall not have the heavy if I can help it. Yeah, So what's crazy about this is these six hundred and seventy five riders riding into three thousand ish Russians and their cannons. Most of them, the majority of them made it. They made it to these Russian lines and they broke them up. They actually at least the Russian artillery position they were charging toward in the center. Yeah, they captured that. They actually managed to force the Russian soldiers to retreat from that, and so they captured those guns. That's insane that that happened like this should have there should have been no one alive, and yet they actually fulfilled this nutsoe mission that should have never happened in the first place because it was a miscommunication.

00:31:26
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and they ended up getting all three of those positions because they went back into position. The light brigade took out one of those positions, which, by the way, I don't know if we made it clear, but one of those positions was the original order, which I guess they eventually got to, right, they just did it out of order. And then the other one was destroyed by a French light cavalry unit called the African Hunters or the how would you pronounce that? Very nice?

00:31:53
Josh: Thanks. It took three years of French in high school.

00:31:57
iHeart Intro: Hey, it's been paying off for eighteen years for us. So French from you, little German for me and everything else mispronounced.

00:32:05
Josh: Oh well, don't forget your Italian accent though. Well, sure we have the whole of Europe covered, yeah, most of it. So when the Lpergate charged through this Valley of death and broke up the Russian artilleries and the French broke up another one. I think there was actually one left still, they had to ride back and were being fired upon by that remaining one too, So they had to ride back from the valley to get to where they started back, you know, to safety again. And when they got back they found that of the six hundred and seventy members of the Lpergate who undertook this charge, one hundred and ten were killed, one hundred and sixty were wounded, three hundred and seventy five horses were killed, so six hundred and seventy of the members, more than half of them lost their horse. And apparently some of the men told Cardigan that they were ready to go again.

00:32:57
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I guess it was, uh, you know, they felt like they did good work, they wanted to do more.

00:33:03
Josh: I mean, I can't imagine if you thought you were going on a suicide mission and it actually works out and you made it back alive. I'm sure you were invigorated as probably under selling it.

00:33:13
iHeart Intro: Yeah, but guys like you and I would have said, how about we don't do that again.

00:33:17
Josh: We would have been like, wait, are you sure that's what he said, because this doesn't make any sense. Let's talk this through.

00:33:24
iHeart Intro: All right. So William Howard Russell is riding about this thing like we talked about. He is the one that ends up and he did some beautiful riding as far as that kind of stuff goes, But he isn't the one who ended up inspiring Tennyson's poem. Maybe i'll read this last line at least it's a pretty good example. Yeah, at the distance of twelve hundred yards, the whole line of the enemy belched forth from thirty iron mouths, a flood of smoke and flame, through which hissed the deadly balls. Their flight was marked by instant gaps in our ranks, by dead men and horses, by steeds flying wounded or riderless across the plane.

00:34:00
Josh: That's pretty good reporting.

00:34:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, pretty good stuff.

00:34:04
Josh: So I think you mentioned before that the charge of the light brigade is viewed as an enormous military blunder. It's still very much taught in schools as like what not to do. It's also I think it's also shorthand among military people as like for any senseless waste of soldiers' lives by higher up calling higher ups, calling bad shots. But it's also revered as an incredibly brave, courageous act. And that's what celebrated, not not the fact that they even were successful. That's not the most celebrated fact. It was that these men just basically put their nose down and did what they had to do. However you feel about that, that's essentially what the what the poem celebrates most of all.

00:34:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah, which was when he was Poet Laureate of England in eight fifty I think think it was about six weeks after that battle is when he published The Charge of the Light Brigade and the Examiner initially, yeah, should we read this last the second stanza.

00:35:11
Josh: Yeah, that's the most famous of all of them.

00:35:14
iHeart Intro: Why don't you take this one?

00:35:16
Josh: I think you should?

00:35:17
iHeart Intro: Okay, forward the light Brigade. Was there a man dismayed, not though the soldier knew someone had blundered theirs, not to make reply their's, not to reason why theirs, but to do and die into the valley of death rode the six hundred.

00:35:36
Josh: Yeah, and apparently Tennyson recorded himself reading this on a wax cylinder, And there's places on the internet, including Amazing Tube, I believe, where you can hear it. And it bears an uncanny resemblance to that remember that doll in the Doll's episode the Old Time he talking doll from the nineteenth century. It sounds a little bit like that. But even getting past that, he I don't think he does a very good job reading it. It's the worst reading I've heard of that ever.

00:36:09
iHeart Intro: So you're saying my reading is better than Tennyson's own.

00:36:11
Josh: I am it is.

00:36:13
iHeart Intro: Oh wow, yeah, so way to go, man, who I appreciate that. Maybe I should be Poet Laureate Reader of England.

00:36:19
Josh: I've been secretly lobbying for you to be named Poet Laureate of the US for years now.

00:36:26
iHeart Intro: My high school had a poet laureate. Who was it, Natasha Trethaway if I'm not mistaken. Wow, she was there when I was there. Pretty cool stuff.

00:36:35
Josh: It's impressive you remember that.

00:36:38
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think she might have been in my grade, So, yeah she was. Who knows, I might have had English class with her for all I know. So there was also from Tennyson, the charge of the heavy Brigade at ballack Lava. It was years after the war though, and this was and this is kind of where we end the story is British war veterans had a very hard time after this in a lot of cases, and there were many efforts to try and raise money and raise awareness for that that a lot of them went to poorhouses and weren't cared for. And this poem was written years later to try and raise money for these war veterans along with Kipling.

00:37:16
Josh: Right, Kipling wrote another one, the Last of the Light Brigade, that actually commemorates the charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaklava and Tennyson's writing of it, and Tennyson actually makes an appearance in this Kipling poem, but both of them were basically for the same reason to call attention to the fact that these Crimean war veterans had just been totally abandoned by their nations and were living in total poverty in a lot of cases. And what's really said is that a fundraising effort that Tennyson led thanks to his poem and his fame too, I mean, like he was a very famous person. Yeah, at this time, they were only able to collect twenty four pounds.

00:37:59
iHeart Intro: That can't can't have been too much even back then. No, there were a couple of movies. There was one from nineteen thirty six, The Charge of the Light Brigade with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Hablind.

00:38:10
Josh: And Olivia to Hablin had her breakthrough role in Airport seventy seven years later.

00:38:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's what she's known for. It was a love triangle movie about British British soldiers that takes place, you know, sort of around this fatal charge. And then another one from sixty eight, right.

00:38:29
Josh: Yeah, it's called The Charge of the Lightpergade. But this one is a satires, satirizing the British aristocracy, especially in the Victorian Age, essentially just hungering for war so they could get their own glory again, buying offices or ranks in the military. And it was John Gielgood as Lord Cardigan. And yeah, I haven't seen.

00:38:53
iHeart Intro: It, Vanessa Redgrave like, what a cast.

00:38:55
Josh: Yeah, it's quite quite a cast. Every time I see John Gielgood or hear his name, I replace his name with doctor feel Good the Motley Crue song. He's the one they called John, Sir John Gielgod. You have to add this, sir.

00:39:09
iHeart Intro: He's the one they call Sir John giel Good.

00:39:12
Josh: There it is. He's the one that makes it feel all right, that's right.

00:39:16
iHeart Intro: If you're watching Arthur, that.

00:39:17
Josh: Is was he in? That was he the butler?

00:39:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think he want to Oscar for that role for the butler.

00:39:26
Josh: Yeah, I mean, I mean, that's impressive.

00:39:28
iHeart Intro: He was great and this is one of my favorite movies growing up still is awesome.

00:39:33
Josh: Well, that's the charge of the lipergade everybody, that's right, Chuck said, that's right. So it's time for listener mail.

00:39:40
iHeart Intro: Hey guys, long story short, I've been listening for four plus years, and, as many others say, you to have no idea how much appreciation your fan base has for you writing this. I was scouring through old episodes. I came acrossing up where you two disagreed on the subject. I can't remember what it was, but you kept the animated conversation going for a few minutes. It was a subtle reminder that the two of you just like anybody else or friends and can totally have disagreements or different opinions. But let's have a little fun. Can you share an example of when you disagreed with the other but rather than voice it on the air, you kept it to yourself. Or are there any topics where you had a disagreement and you cut it out? That is warmly from Warner Finn ps, Mom and Dad. I'll go ahead and answer for my part in that. I don't think we've ever had a disagreement that we've like off cut out of the episode that I can think of.

00:40:32
Josh: No, we almost, Yeah, we leave those in. I can't think of one either.

00:40:36
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and I can't think of I mean, there's the famous you know, watering the lawns and things like that from past episodes. But I mean, I'm sure there's lots of little things I might disagree on it in the moment that I keep to myself that just aren't a big deal, and I don't bring them up because it's just not worth mentioning in a show episode.

00:40:56
Josh: Yeah, you want to keep the show going. Plus Also, I mean, you can only correct one another so often before you start seeming like a know it all or whatever, or it just is interruptive most of the time. It just doesn't matter. Like chassis. You remember you're saying chassis, right, and I didn't correct you, man, it just didn't matter, you know.

00:41:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, exactly, and uh yeah, I think that sums it up best. We uh and on just big stuff philosophically, we're pretty much aligned as humans and friends. So like, that's why there's never any big stuff is because we both kind of park our cars in the same garage.

00:41:31
Josh: It would be the most part you much different podcast if we if we didn't see eye to eye generally on the big stuff.

00:41:38
iHeart Intro: I think yeah, And I mean, I think most of the disagreements are like you didn't like that movie that kind of stuff, right, and who cares about that?

00:41:46
Josh: Yeah? Or you've never had pizza rolls.

00:41:51
iHeart Intro: Yeah, Like I don't like pickles and mustard, And even though you're determined to you, it's me. There's a pickle and a mustard.

00:41:57
Josh: I might like, Yeah, no, I finally accepted both. Okay, I've accepted it that you don't like pickles.

00:42:03
iHeart Intro: It's okay, Well that's recent because last week you tried to feed me a pickle mustard samwich.

00:42:07
Josh: It's just from yesterday. I really gave a lot of thought to it in the sauna. Okay, good, and yeah, I'm like, you just didn't like pickles.

00:42:15
iHeart Intro: I wonder what you were thinking about that day?

00:42:17
Josh: That was it?

00:42:18
Chuck: All right?

00:42:19
Josh: All right? Who was that from?

00:42:21
iHeart Intro: That was from Warner Fenn in Los Angeles. Oh, that's it.

00:42:26
Josh: You're gonna see something else, Thanks a lot, Warner.

00:42:29
iHeart Intro: I was, but I stopped myself.

00:42:31
Josh: See how that happened. Were you gonna correct me or something?

00:42:33
iHeart Intro: No, not at all. I'll tell you.

00:42:35
Josh: Okay, Thanks a lot Warner. That was a really great email. It reminds me of the kind of questions we get at the Q and A we do at our live shows, which we have coming up. I think we're probably in the middle of them right now when this comes out. That's right, or we're gonna be other places too, So you can find out where we're gonna be by going to Stuffishould Know dot com and clicking on the on tour button.
