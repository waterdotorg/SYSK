Josh: Brought to you by the all New Toyota Corolla. Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from how Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant and Jerry's over there. So this is stuff you should know the podcast. Jerry with her face tattoos, fipster Maory wanna be Mariya thoughts Maori Maori? Yeah, we just looked at the pronunciation. I was sure Chuck was right because he picked this article. But it looks like mayori. It seems like that should be an acceptable pronunciation as well. I know, and you know we have lots of quiet fans. They're in New Zealand. Hey, everybody, and so this is for you. And if you're not from New Zealand all the other ones, you shouldn't be listening to just this one. Uh, if you're not from New Zealand, then I think you'll enjoyed anyway, because um, indigenous tribes are interesting. Plus those of you outside New Zealand won't know how much stuff we got wrong. That's right. Yeah, So chuckers, yes, were you familiar with the Maori ahead of time? Did you know most of this stuff from this article. No, I had seen the movie Once We're Warriors, and that was my introduction to them. Is that right many years ago? Yeah, that was the one that won a bunch of Academy awards, right, or I'm thinking a Whale Rider, You're thinking a Whale Rider? But um, yeah, Once We're Warriors is not I feel good movie. Is it a documentary, No, it's a it's um just a regular narrative feature. But it's uh, it shows sort of the dark side of the modern Maori, with like propensities for violence and crime and alcoholism. So basically it's like, I guess anyone who hears the story in the US will be like this sounds familiar. An indigenous group pushed around and completely obliterated by uh Europeans. Yeah, and then later on perhaps suffering from alcoholism and and further marginalization, trying to hang onto a culture that is not well, it exists. But I don't want to spoil anything. Well, I think, okay, So my my, uh, the extent that I came to figure out my awareness of the Maori um culture, it's my familiarity with Mike Tyson's face tattoo and Um, the fact that there's such a thing as tribal tattoos and that those are mostly rooted in Maori uh tattooing. And in fact, the Maori they didn't necessarily come up with tattooing. They're directly descended from the people who did. But they had a specific kind of tattoo, a specific method of tattooing. I should say that kind of um gains them the status of the toughest tattoo people around, and that they used not needles but chisels to do their tattoos, which are called the tomoco. Yeah, tom moko two words I think so, No, I mean it's two words of moco is the face tattoo specifically, I think right. Um, there's another type of tattoo that's not quite as um spiritual as well, we'll find out, called kiri two hey and um that's kind of more like the tribal bands you see around people's arms and things like that. Yeah. Like, if you're a hipster with mocho face tattoos and you're from um, Michigan, then you're gonna be frowned upon by real Maori people because you shouldn't have a moco on your face. No, you should have the other one because that's not as sacred, right, you know what I'm saying. I know what you're saying. And the question is do the people who have these face tattoos know what you're saying. I don't know. I've seen these white dudes with it, and I'm just like, you know you're not Maori. Well I was. When I was looking up like Mike Tyson Maori face tattoo, Like, a whole slew of articles came up about how he was. His visa was canceled before a trip to New Zealand. It was like, and was it because he had faced tattoo? No criminal past? Which makes sense? Yeah? And I don't his. I don't think his is amoco. I think it's just a face tattoo. Okay, let's get into it, man, because there's much more to it than face statoos. Yeah. So the Maori are credited as being the first um settlers of New Zealand. The thing is, there's a lot of controversy around this. I should say in academic circles, it's um typically accepted, widely accepted, and that it's been proven that the Maori were the original settlers of New Zealand. Um, there are other circles that are like, no, there's there's there's evidence that they're not the Maori zone. Oral history says that there are people there before them. There's evidence here there. But for the most part, if you believe that in academic circles, you are considered fringe dweller. Right, So for the most part that the generally accepted ideas that the Maori settled New Zealand from Polynesia somewhere between uh twelve eighty and fourteen fifty. Yeah, and they came over on canoes, on ocean canoes that they still used today. And um, they supposedly came from a mythical land called Hawaiki. But um, these days scholars will say, what that probably is is a combo of some real places. Um, Tahiti, Samoa in the Cook Islands. Yeah, it's made of tomato exactly. But they got to New Zealand and they named it uh uh Otowa And there's a lot of pronunciations in here. We might not get exactly right by the way, I think that might be right. Actually, Oh to Rowa, I'm gonna say the a is silent. I don't think so it's capitalized even that means land of the long white cloud, right and in other words, it's the Maori name for New Zealand. Yeah. Um, And we should say that when the Maori arrived, they arrived as they didn't describe themselves or self describe as Maori until the Europeans came. Before then, it was just desparate tribes that were familiar with one another. But they settled. Uh. It's believed either in close together waves or like pretty much all at once heading out from Polynesia, arriving and saying okay, let's go to war. Pretty much. The name means ordinary or common. And they were and are tough people, right. And the reason Maori means ordinary or common is they're referring to themselves in comparison to white Europeans who, right, and their knickers in their fancy hats with feathers and the muskets. Yeah, so that's not very ordinary, especially compared to Maori. Um. And they had a name for them, uh pakeha. Yes, those are white Europeans who came colon settlers. Anybody who wasn't Maori ordinary? Very true? Um. And like we said, they were tough, they were very fierce. Um. When they battled one of the trophies that they would and you know a lot of tribes you'll see do this that we'll put the old head on the steak as a trophy. Very tough. Um. And then something else we'll get into in a minute is very important to them called mana, which is a power or prestige, and uh, there was a lot of fighting going on when the mana was challenged or disrupted basically sort of like, um, you insult me, so we're gonna go to go to war, right, But all of this was extremely structured. Um. The Maori wars were typically held in the fall after the harvest, right yeah football season. Yeah. Um, let's a really good analogy. Uh. They would use weapons um that were usually clubs. There were a short range battle clubs called kaika uh, and then there were clubs that had a cutting edge that were called patu. These are the most typical weapons used in these battles. And you would get brained and creamed and be up to heck. Yeah. But as far as loss of life goes compared to firearms, there was there were relatively few. Yeah. It sort of reminded me of the old gang fights back in the day, like when you would get together with your chains and your clubs and hit each other and fight. Yeah, and then you would walk away with your bruises and your scrapes and um, not a lot of loss of life, right, But the the intent was the same. It was the vanquished people to get control of their land, to make them move to more populated, less fertile areas. Um. And like you said, it was to gain mana or prestige for your tribe. Um. Everything changed once the Europeans came and brought firearms, as is the pretty by now familiar narrative for anybody who's listened to one of our cultural historical episodes. Yeah, it's pretty interesting that it follows about the same path all over the world. You know, the boomstick comes in, the white folks come in with the boomstick and the powder, the boom powder, and then things change, um. And things changed by the Maori gaining access to some of these guns. Um. And it says here you know, they would trade things like pigs and flax and potatoes. But I watched the documentary last night and six, as the documentarian said, was the big trading coinage basically what it was six? What is that s e x six? He kept saying it though, you know, in that Kiwi accent, which is one of my favorites, by the way. Um. And so they would trade when they ran out of other stuff to trade. You know, it was a big hot spot for Europeans, not even to settle necessarily, but to come by and do some trading and stop over. And they would stop over and they would sign their women up to like three week contracts and trade for one musket. And it was a very sexual culture. Like women and this was in the hundreds could take like multiple lovers and not be looked down upon. And they didn't have the hangups that europe did about sex. Yeah, I know, the HMS bounty was mutinied because the sailors wanted to go back to Polynesia. Well, dude, the Maori were down with it early on. They didn't have big hang ups, um hang ups. You could have sex before you were married and it wasn't a big deal. Um. So the sex trade by the eighteen thirties was the biggest uh money maker in New Zealand at the musket huh so chuck the when the muskets come along um eighteen oh seven is kind of a seminal year because this is the year when the first Maori tribe um got their hands on muskets and used them for battle. Yeah. The problem is they hadn't practiced quite so much, and so as they're trying to fire and reload and aim, they were vanquished by the ie they raided with using traditional clubs and get clubbed in the head while they're trying to load a musket. And I think that some of them started to swinging the musket like a big club, which is it makes sense, especially even out of frustration. And that actually started the musket wars. Yeah, because the leader of that tribe said, you know what, we these firearms. We shouldn't abandon him yet, so let's get some more and we'll trade whatever we need to for him, and let's practice this time, and hence the musket wars were born. Once they got good, they started tearing up the countryside in eighteen fifteen and just basically said we've got these guns, we're gonna kill you, take your land, enslave you, and maybe eat you. Yes, they mentioned that a lot of Polynesian tribes they they were accused of cannibalism. I don't know if it's true or not. Yeah, bears pointing out them, right. Um, but this first group that got the muskets definitely changed everything because now it was kind of like, um, when the Soviets and the Americans, when the Americans had the bomb. So if you were like, we have to have the bomb. Now you can't just have one country with the bomb. You couldn't have just one Maori tribe with firearms. Other groups were forced to adopt firearms as well, and hence the musket wars got pretty bloody. Yeah, but it became the great equalizer. About twenty Maori and New Zealander's died. But once everyone had guns, it's sort of calm things down in a weird way. Yeah. Well, it's like the mutual usured destruction exactly. So before we move on, I think it's a good time for a message break, all right, So let's continue. So chuck um. The eighteen thirties, Uh, two tribes that have been forced off their land by other must get using. Maoris um went south. I believe it was south of the Chatham Islands. Yeah. They wanted to basically find a better place to live where all this war wasn't going on. But they found the Moriory people and that's right, but what's one more war? Exactly because they were a peaceful people and they were like, well, you know, these people are here, let's figure out what to do with them. And they said kill them, kill them basically, Yeah, that's what they did. They killed them, thrust them into slavery, and then um basically took over Chatham Island and now it was a Maori island, right. So one genocide, that goot another genocide, that's right. So the Maori are like pretty well established by this time, but they're kind of hanging onto their cultural lives um, and everything kind of hinged on a rumor. I don't know if it was a factual rumor or not, but come eighteen thirty five there was a rumor that France was going to try to annex New Zealand. Yeah, and previous previous day, eighteen forty they were pretty welcoming of the Europeans, like they are of trading with them. They got along pretty well. Even this guy in the documentary that said six said that they were you know, they got pretty friendly and they said, you know, come here, route down will be trade partners and we all got along great. But like you said in thirty five, that's when France started, or at least there the Maori's point of view was France was trying to get their little French hooks in them, right and good. By this time, the Maori had a pretty good idea that they were in trouble. They were losing their numbers, which they think hit about a hundred thousand before contact with Europeans, um to not just the Musket Wars, but also disease introduced by Europeans and familiar thing um. So they they decided to allie themselves. In the face of this rumor that France um was gonna annex New Zealand, they decided to allie their lands to the British. And why not at the time, who else are you gonna go with? Yeah, they're like, we like your powdered wigs, Yeah you're read, Yeah, like your accent. We can nick that and change it around a bit and making our own. And so let's sign the Treaty of Watangi. Yes, and uh it was. It was a pretty good contract. At first, they thought, um it gave the Marory control over their own land, and yeah, so they think, um, until it turns out that the British really said, you know what, we're gonna take a lot of that land. We're gonna tax you and violate the treaty in that way, and um, this ancestral land that's been in your family forever, we're gonna we're gonna just take what we want basically and shuffle you to the side, just like American treaty was going to be broken. So that started the New Zealand Wars. And this guy in the documentary said, it's sort of again, sort of like here in America, they weren't really taught that so much in school, or they were taught a very sanitized version of the New Zealand Wars, when in fact it was thirty years of very bloody, fierce battling with the British soldiers in the British government, and um, dwindled down to really sad. So at this point, what you have is what would be called an evolutionary bottleneck. Basically, Um, you have a group of population that's in real danger of extinction. Um. And I guess what the Marie does say, Okay, all right, the British control New Zealand. We're not going away. We are fierce warriors. Have you seen these tattoos we got? Uh? And the British said again, we are in control of New Zealand. You just said it yourself. We won't wipe you out entirely because hey, it's almost the twentieth century and who does that, right, Um, But we are going to anglicize you. And first let's start by creating an alphabet. Which this struck me as weird, right, Marie culture had an oral tradition. They didn't have any written language. They had totems basically what amount to totems comparison, um, But they didn't have any kind of alphabet or written language. And so European missionaries said about creating one. Rather than teaching them just English, like oh, well, here's your written language, they went about creating a Maori written language, which is strange to me, you know, like there's this is the Maori experience. It's almost like a condensed version of what went on in in North America and in the United States. There's like one treaty. Um, there's some weird aspects to it, where like missionaries are not just trying to anglicize the groups, they're helping them preserve their culture simultaneously. UM. And I think that that was helped Maori culture survived by taking their royal traditions and writing them down. But that's not to say the Maori were helpless in preserving their own traditions because as we'll see that everyone's expected to know their own history and to be able to recite it. Yeah, for sure. Um. And that that came along in the seventies is when they really started to sort of gain more ground in re establishing their culture and claiming their culture as their own. Uh. Previous to that, they it really dwindled because they they they scattered. Basically they started to move to urban areas. Um. After World War Two there was a mass migration. Prior to the war lived in rural New Zealand and twenty years later lived in urban areas. So I mean that's when you moved the tribe from their native land. You take their land and they moved to the big city. It just the culture is just gonna go away. Well, it gets diluted, especially in the face of the government. Um. The official language of New Zealand was English. Yeah, they tried their best to stamp it out there. Yeah, there were government schools that weren't like they didn't teach anything about myer Maori culture. Yeah. Um so yeah, the the culture was the people were still there, but they were losing their culture. And then like you said again, uh, analogous to um, North America in the nineteen seventies saw a an awakening of pride in being a Maori, just like the aim the American Indian Movement was founded in the seventies UM and in the nineteen eighties. By that time about of the Maori were actually fluent speakers of their language, which was Terreo Maori was the name of the language. So it was a big win, it was, but the there was a lot of groundwork that was laid between the seventies and eighties, a lot of battles that were fought. In one UM, there's a the establishment of the Maori Party and political party. UM. They sued the government to have Treo Maori, the Maori language be officially recognized somehow, and in ninety five UM the British were forced to say, yes, this is a treasure that we were supposed to protect under the Treaty of what Tangy and we didn't, So now we're gonna make this one of three official languages in New Zealand. English, New Zealand Sign Language and uh Terrayo Maori are now the three official languages of New Zealand. Exactly in nineteen seventy five that was the designation of Maori Language Week and they opened the first bilingual school in ninety eight. So by the time five rolled around, they made it an official one of the official languages. Um, like we said about we're now speaking it and fluent in it, and um, you know, the British were like, well, we'll give you these small things, but what we don't want to give you back is your land. But they were forced to eventually with the what what Tangi Tribunal in nineteen it was It's not h I don't think it was um. I don't think they established laws. I think it was just like you fill an application out into a claim on some land and they'll decide whether or not to give it back to your family. And they did to a large degree, not all of it though. So was it like a European run tribunal that like um that indigenous people went and petitioned or was it was it made up of indigenous people, because I got the impression that they were like jealously guarded um Maori culture and we're like suing for repatriation of Maori artifacts from other museums. And well, yeah, that definitely happened because there were you know, Maori trinkets and um heads all over the world. And it's still ongoing today. Um, like all these reparations are still going on, like people are still getting back their land even here in the twenty one century. So the um the Maori culture kind of is vibrant, beaten down, hangs on by a thread and starts to revive. Right. That's right, that's good. That's where we're at. Okay, um, let's talk a little bit about their culture again. A lot of it was deluded and lost over time, but there's still like some very robust um fundamentals that are very much alive today. Yeah. They're very spiritual people, even though they were fierce warriors. Um and you know a lot of the white folks thought they were savages. Of course, sounds familiar, like the face tattoos were very much repressed but never went away exactly. Um. So they're very spiritual. They believe that um, their ancestors and other supernatural beings are always around. UM, their family and their ancestry is really really important. Their genealogy, which they called the uh waka papa waka papa. I went with wakapapa waka papa. UM, that's the genealogy of the ancestors. Um spiritual and mythological significance and basically your whole spiritual existence as a person is told through the wakapapa, and the face tattoos will tell that story. That's what that's what it means. That's why they're not hip on non Maori people getting these things. Yeah, you're insulting like their ancestry basically, and they're really protective of this stuff. I was reading um about Maori waka papa stories and how like if you're like a social services worker, like you're not necessarily told to ask these questions that would be considered part of somebody's wakapapa, Like they'll tell you if they trust you. Um. Yeah, and you don't just run around telling just anybody. There's actually some sort of UM. I believe there's a law where Maori will tell the their waka papa to government agencies. But these things have to be like explicitly protected, like now that they're being put out there on the internet and everything, they need to like your protection because these things are sacred. They belong to the individual because that's their history, and since there wasn't anything before like a written language, speaking it out loud is extremely sacred and protected. Yeah. Well, part of it too is there. Um. They're really big on learning and changing things that they did wrong, learning from past mistakes. So part of the waka papa is it's not just like some rosy history of their family. It's also the bad because if you understand your past, you can understand your future better. Right, And the point of it is to keep going as far back as you can and usually from from this article they and at about the time your ancestors arrived. Uh so we talked about mana a little bit, the honor in prestige. Um. There are three forms of mana in the culture. It's one is achieved by birth. So basically what the rank of your descendants and your ancestors um the mana given by other people um, which this article says they boiled down to two good deeds, like being recognized for what you've done to pat on the back. Yeah, here's your mana. Um, and then mana of the group, which is when outsiders visit and if they leave with a good you know, a review on Yelp for you right or trip Advisor. These guys are so welcoming, then that's mana of the group and it's very important to them, you know, they want to have a good uh leave a good impression. I guess, well, yeah, there's exactly. Um, you can also be affected by Correo corel. This one's tough, carrero ko r e er oh. Which is the spoken word, um, which is where you're you gain mana by house people speak of you personally. I guess yeah. I think it's kind of like mana of the group, but for an individual. Yeah, and you mentioned earlier how they had an oral history. Um that of course the white Christian missionaries poop pooed. They said, now you've got right stuff down, and they said, no, we're not just like telling stories here. We actually like historians are trained and uh, their memory is trained to remember everything about the history. So it wasn't just like, hey, let's just tell stories about our past. Like historians were revered and very important and and uh acknowledge for their like incredible memories. So coming up next, we gotta have a little message break, but we're going to talk about what I think is one of the coolest things, which is the hakka dance. That's something big. Huh yeah, well let's let's get back to it, all right, the hakkah dance. Have you seen this? I have? Um. I saw in Budapest, of all places, at a natural history museum there was a like basically a grass outfit and um, like there was video of a guy wearing this grass outfit doing a hackey dance by himself. Yeah, it was like ethnographical footage. See I've never seen it, um with a like a solo dancer. I've usually just seen it as a big group, like a whole tribe. And um, it's really cool, Like you should look it up on on the YouTube. H A k A um. Very in fact, they're doing it in the picture right there, very uh like intimidating. They would do it before battle, and it's kind of scary and like when they first get started, before they're even moving in unison, they're just like individually shouting out things and sticking out their tongue and their eyes are wide and crazy and it's just like it's it would have sent me running for the hills, right, Well, that's what I was intended to. Um. And the New Zealand national rugby team, the All Blacks, they do a hakka before every rugby game. Yeah, they still do it for They've done it for more than a hundred years, I think, starting in Yeah, and they got the name the All Blacks when they change uniforms to all black uniforms makes sense. And um again to intimidate and even watch the rugby team do it, and um, it's pretty cool. Yeah, Like I would like to try it out, but I think I would just people laugh at me. Let's let's if I wouldn't intimidate anyone with my hawka, especially if you like bulls dr eves and start your tongue out to that, wouldn't I wouldn't have the same effect. Nope, let's talk. Let's talk chuck. The two that is actually from the Polynesian word t a t a u ta tao I guess and um, which means to mark. Yeah, and they we need to do one on the whole tattoo thing. We will um and Like we said, the Maori aren't the first to come up with tattoos. You can trace back further in their Polynesian lineage, but they are the ones that use chisels, really sharp chisels, but chisels. Nonetheless, Yeah, I wonder how that works. It's like you hammer in I know how chisel works. But and then you rub the pigment. And so basically you take a very sharp chisel and ammer and you make a mark. And then after you've made your marks, you go through and rub a pigment, usually taken from a certain type of caterpillar. And then the since you're you've used the chisel instead of a needle, there's not only a tattoo, but there's also scarification along where you made that chisel mark. So the original Maori tomokos were like they were pretty severe looking. They looked even more like hardcore than a regular That's what I was gonna ask is how like how tight was it? You know? I think I have the feeling that like this was like considered an art form. Is all right? Well, I know, they, incidentally, um are the ones who introduced color tattoos. UM, even though most of the Moco have seen or black, So I don't know if they just don't use color that much. They like, I haven't seen any color money either, but you know a rainbow dolphin. And they're like, let's just go back to the moco. H Um. Men typically have the moco on their face. Um, but women also have the tattoos and um, they have them on the arms, the thighs, the abdomen, and the crotch. Apparently, well, men will have him on the face, buttocks, and thighs and it's detailed stuff like I'm sure you've seen it before, um, but if not, look it up right now, because it's not like Mike Dyson, right, well, I mean it's there. It's supposed to depict the waka papa, like each swirl and symbol has like a real meaning that has to do with the person's genealogy. That's right, it's pretty cool. Um. And then again we said that there's another kind of tattoo that's not quite as intricate that's called the um what is it called the kira tuohy? Yeah, yeah, which is just fun to say. And I think that won't offend and and I think the impression that I have is Maori culture from this resurgence of Maori pride in the seventies and the revival of the culture, and say like taking steps to save it, like they do very jealously protect and guard their culture, their cultural history, their personal lineage. Um. And so it is I mean maybe even compared to other indigenous tribes, Respecting Maori culture on its own terms is a good idea for sure. Uh. These days they make quite a comeback in population. Um. New Zealand as a whole has more than four million people in about fourteen percent or Maori, compared to a low of about forty five thousand and eighteen nineties. Yeah, it's about five sixty thou people. Um. But like I said, there are like many marginalized indigenous tribes all over the world, there are problems with alcoholism. Um. The Maori are as far as more likely to be drinkers than uh fifty six percent Pacific Islanders. And among those who consume alcohol, hazardous drinking occurs and thirty six percent of Mau. Um And crime too, in violence is still sort of part of the culture. Sadly, Um, I think I have some stats here from a criminologist. Uh, even though they only make up four percent of the population. I believe. Um, they make up about of people in prison and they you know, they throw that right back to the fact that they were marginalized and their culture was stamped out. And uh, young people are more likely to be violent. Young Maori are than than older ones now. But um yeah, apparently the losing your cultural identity really put a you know, hamper on your evolution, is it? People? I mean you can see that all over the world. Keen to you certainly can. Um So, let's Maori. If you want to know more? Do you have anything else right now? I got nothing else. If you want to know more about the Maori people, you can type in m A O R I in the search bar at house to horks dot com. We'll bring up this article. And since I said Maori, it's time Chuck for listener mail. I'm gonna call this email from a student at North Carolina Wilmington's. Hey, guys, he's an econ dude. My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over three years and are both members of the stuff you should know Army. In the early days of our relationship, I used to pay her in doll hairs for favors such just cooking dinner or getting out of bed to plug my phone in when I forgot, I do this too. I tell Emily, like, I'll give you six seventy five dollars to take out the trash, and I'll just make up. You know, we keep a running tap of what we owe each other. It's just fun. He's just doll hairs, uh, Being that a doll hair is not real currency, that's why he uses it. Um. I could bid the price up or down with ease, depending on her mood. The going rate for dinner was about twelve thousand dollar hairs and a BackRub was d h capital d h uh um. Of course she was quickly. She quickly figured out that she was not accruing the American dollars she thought she was, and wanted her doll hairs exchange for US currency to get myself out of this. I quickly got on eBay to purchase her six hundred thousand Zimbabwe dollars to fulfill up my financial debt obligation. Uh. Like you, I appreciated the novelty of owning paper currency from a country that's all hyperinflation on the scale the world has never seen. We both got a real laugh out of a joke, and I am out of debt now. We both now carry one hundred thousand dollars in our wallets every day so we don't feel like broke college kids. Um. Economic research is a great passion of mine, from observation to data collection and model building. I find happiness through math and statistics.
