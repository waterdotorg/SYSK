Josh: Hey, everybody, it's Josh and Chuck and we now present you with ten of our favorite episodes of all times, ones that we haven't released as select yet and um, just because we thought you might be sitting around board wanting to hear some more stuff. That's right, everyone, so be safe, be kind to one another, and learn a thing or two. Here we go, Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles, Chuck, Bryant, Audie. Uh high sugar dun dun. That's a I was thinking about the earlier at the Archie. So that was an Archie song. Oh sugar, honey, honey. D see you called Pete your girlfriend like a sugar or hunting or your wife or whatever, and it's those are all sweet things. Yeah, that all makes sense. Did you get your head? Yeah? I mean you wouldn't call you call your wife something bitter right like um, like Korean melon. I was trying to think of something bitter. I couldn't think of anything. Come here, my little Korean melon. I bet someone said that. Who I don't know someone Korean? No, and Korea they just call him Melons. That's true, man, this is the worst start ever. This is the worst ever. I knew we would achieve it. We've been building towards well. We top ourselves every episode. Really, that's right, um chuck. Yes, have you ever tasted sugar? I have. I'm trying to bring it back from the break. Yes, I have, I have to. Sugar is a big popular sweetener these days. It is uh and it's been around for a while. I don't know if you know this or not, but apparently they think sugar is indigenous to the island known as New Guinea in the South Pacific around Polynesia, and um that as long as five thousand to eight thousand years ago, the Polynesians were cultivating it and going like this is the jam, sweet and yummy and sweet energy, and it makes us fat. Remember that Simpsons where we're I guess Bart grows up to be like a paid taste tester, and like he drinks that soda and like turns into like this horrible, huge, disfigured thing, and he goes sweet and the guy with the clipboard goes pleasing taste some monsterism, you remember, I don't remember that. It was great was that the one where they was there all of their future selves. No, it was like just a momentary day dream and it goes back to like his normal self and he's like cool, like he can't wait to grow up to be a professional taste. You know, the table readingly set out on that should be coming out. I can't wait this year. Right, it was a good one. Yeah, it should be coming out. It's exciting. I'm excited. We can't say what it's about. No, I don't know if we can. We're just covering. We're gonna air on the side of caution because the last one we want us for the symptoms to be mad at us after all these years for real? Yeah, alright, So where are we? Sugar? So I guess Apparently island hopped from New Guinea across Polynesia, made its way up to Indonesia and then finally landed in India. And when it was in India, it really started to spread. Everything spread from India back then trade routes and thanks to the Crusades, it was brought to Western Europe. Well even before that, the Persians started conquering the land and they encountered sugar and brought that with them. That's right. And then you got Columbus, that jerk brought sugarcane itself to the Caribbean and said, you know, like some some roots samplings, and said, let's try and plant this stuff here. And it turned out it was a great place to plant sugarcane. It really was, because sugarcane is a tropical plant. Yeah, the cane, you can't grow it any just anywhere, but you can grow it in places like South America, the Caribbean, South Africa, southern United States, hot places, India, as we already mentioned. And it just kind of spread like wildfire across the world, especially once it came to what's known as the New World, like you said, via Columbus. Unfortunately, it also was and it became an agent of slavery. Yes, uh, it certainly did. It fueled the slave trade for quite a while. Um. And then by seventeen fifty there were a hundred and twenty sugar refineries in Britain. They called it white gold, and uh, it was up until that point it had been kind of a luxury. Well a little before that it beat it became a little more widespread. It was a complete luxury. Like literally it was for royalty pretty much. It was so rare and hard to come by. UM. Apparently the first enter, the first Seaborn International Sugar Exchange was between Venice and England in thirteen nineteen. I saw that Venice was the first place where they were like refining it really well, right, and the Venetians where that was a merchant city if there ever was one. So they were selling it and one of the places they sold, the first place they sold it to overseas was England, and it was in thirteen nineteen, and they sold fifty tons for what's the equivalent of about eleven million dollars today, and that's tons with an N N E. I'm sure so yes, and right now you could get that for about twenty thousand dollars. It was eleven million dollars back then, so it was very very expensive. But then two things happened that opened the sugar industry and made it available to the general public. Uh. The Reformation, which actually strangely led to a decrease in honey because monasteries were the major producers of honey. Monks kept bees, and the Reformation led to a closure of a lot of monasteries and UM. Secondly, sugar just became more available. Like those two things happened at the same time, and all of a sudden it was something that the average person could get their hands on, and it actually led to a huge increase in tea consumption. Oh yeah, because before then people drank tea. But once they started putting sugar in their tea, they're like, we love tea, And that's when it became like the the national drink of Great Britain. Man, I love a good English tea with a little cream and little sugar in it. Just delicious, you t guy? I like the herb eat kind more. No, I like it all. Man. I love green tea, I love English breakfast tea. You love black tea. I'll even do a little I'll chiye it up every now and then. I'm I'm into all of it. That's a wild sidewalk, uh. And from about eighteen fifteen there was a lot of warring going on in Europe and there were naval blockades by Britain that basically Europe needed that sugar fix and they were like, but you can't cut us off. We love sugar now. And so in seventeen forty seven they realized that the sugar beat, which is the other way you can get sugar, was a great way to do it, and that's how they get their sugar today. Still. And the beat is um looks like a beat that's not purple. It's a root and it grows up out of the ground. Looks like a little uh, just sort of whitish, light brown. Yeah, sort of like a turnip. But it's sweet. It is about seventeen percent of the sugar beet is uh can eventually become sugar, as opposed to only about ten in the cane, which I thought was unusual. Yeah, so you have these two plants that can be processed separately independently, and both will produce is sugar indistinguishable to the average person, pretty neat. And the reason why I chuck, The reason why that why it would be indistinguishable is because all plants have sugar. That's right. It's a carbohydrate, a simple carbohydrate, and um. Sugar is a part of photosynthesis. But you can't go out and get, you know, a blade of switch grass and get enough sugar out of it to make sugar, even though the sugar in it, it's only abundant enough in the beet in the cane to really produce sugar. Sugar exactly, but sugars is kind of this um. It's it's a molecule that powers the earth. Yeah, really like humans, plants, everything gets is powered by sugar. It's pretty neat. It is pretty neat. Uh. It is also as a you can be used it as a preservative. UM. It prevents bacteria from growing in jam um. Sometimes you can change the texture. They use it as like a food editive to make something look and feel different, not only just taste different. They're like, this doesn't put fuzzy little jackets on people's teeth when they eat it. Enough, So let's add some sugar. And our favorite use of sugar is to make booze. Accelerates fermentation. And my favorite uses of sugar are to make booze and to make Reese's Pieces. Okay, let's not leave that out. Yeah, it's a it's an important part of the production of alcohol and Reese's Pieces and Reese's Pieces, and it does make the world go round. Um. And the world actually produces quite a bit of sugar. So in this article from a few years ago, it says that um the world made about seventy eight million tons. That's seventy one metric tons of sugarcane annually. Is that accurate? Stild? You know, well, it's just sugarcane. But I know that sugarcane accounts for eighty percent of sugar production about and then sugar beats account for about um But in I think two thousand thirteen, the world produced a hundred and sixty five million metric tons of sugar. Okay, yeah, so I guess you'd have to be a mathematician to figure out that formula. But plus you probably have to have more info than weeds. This cave. The cane, sugar cane looks sort of like bamboo, the stock does. It's a tropical grass. To the top of it looks grassy, and it takes about a year or to grow. It takes about eighteen months from planting. But once it's planted, you know, you cut it back to the route and it will take another twelve months for that to grow back up to be harvested again. So what's the eighteen months thing? Then eight months is if you plan a brand new oh god jokes like from from seed, I guess grows and breaks. They call him cane brakes, which I always think is like one of the neater like Earth science terms cane brakes, cane brake. Uh, it is grown and not always um refined near where it's grown, but it is harvested and h and processed initially close to where it's grown, so it doesn't rot. Sort of like like when we did coffee. You know, you want to do most of that stuff near where it's grown, right, And there are some stuffs you have to take to harvest sugar at least even get into the to the raw state. But yeah, not every processing place refines it all the way to what we would call table. Yeah, sometimes it's sent to a refinery, so I guess we can cover that in broad strokes here. But it, I mean, it's pretty complicated. And yeah, I mean, if you're looking for the end all be all of how sugar is produced, then go watching our long video on YouTube. What was it? Remember how how um incredibly complex chocolate making is. Remember I love all these These are some of my favorite ones. Salt, sugar, coffee, commodities. Yeah, the commodity sweet. We gotta do tea we haven't done tea, okay, and wine we still haven't done wine yet. Yeah. That one that just bugs me. We've got a great offer from a nice guy. I don't have his name in my memory, but I have his email in a safeholder. Yeah, and he was like, you need some help with this stuff. I've got experts. We're ready to talk to you about wine. That could that should be a sweet That's a dense, dense topic. All right, So sugar beets, let's talk about that in the process. Um, usually they're gonna extract over the winter months between September and February. And as we said earlier, sugar beat is about seventeen percent sugar. Yeah, so not too bad bang for your buck wise, you know, I mean, considering the cane is only ten percent. Yeah, I mean you could pick it up and eat it and be like, this is pretty sweet. Oh yeah seven. I guess if you're in Russia you could. That's true. That's their esist pieces sugar beets UH in a stolen international incident. No things are tense right now, you know, Yeah, between US and UH and Russia. Yeah, it's like nineteen seventies seven again, we'll the kicking us out of the space station. Star Wars just came out. Uh. So, if you're gonna process sugar beet. You're gonna slice it and you're gonna put it in hot water and you're gonna boil it. And it's similar to sugarcane. They're gonna make a sugary juice. Then they're gonna filter it, purify it, concentrate it, isolate those sugars, and eventually you're gonna get sugar crystals developing because you send that syrupy juice through what's called a centrifuge, and that's going to separate the crystal from what is known as the mother liquor. Whatever is left which is one of my favorite terms. Now, when whatever is left over that's not crystal is mother liquor like byproducts in the original juice, And apparently that can be h extracted a few times, I would guess, so to get all the crystals out of it. Yeah, and I think sometimes they need to add a little sugar dust to spur that crystallization. Wow, it sounds like a magical process. There's mother liquor, there's sugar dust. And actually know that you bring up sugar dusts you know, do you remember down in Savannah and like two thousand seven eight, that sugar refinery that exploded. It was sugar that exploded. Dust in the air. Yeah, sugar. Dust is particular matter, and when it gets into the air, it can catch fire and explode. And it did. It blew that place sky high? Yeah. When was that? I wrote about it when I got here, So I would guess like two thousand seven or two thousand and eight. What was the article like, how can sugar explode? I think I remember seeing that. We should have touched on that. I guess I just did. But I mean, like you should go back and check out that now that you realize that it was just sugar. Yeah, that blew that place up. It it formed a crater. Basically, it just blew the whole refiner. Any flour could do that too, right, same principle. Yeah, any particulate matter I can do that. I think can that's nutty? Yeah? Um, alright, So sugarcane, it is a very similar process. They're gonna pulverize the stalk um, add water and lime and that's going to be your syrupy sweet juice and not lime like limestone. Yeah, not like squeeze limes into it. I had to double check. No, you're right, because it's tropical you know exactly. Uh, and they're also going to run that through this interfuge, and you're gonna get your mother liquor in your crystals, and that is also going to be washed and filtered and refined further until you get your sugary white goodness, you know. Evaporations going on. It's it's it's one of those things that sounds complicated, but it's actually pretty simple. It's the same as when you're like making a simple syrup at home. You're boiling sugar and water. It evaporates off, and you're gonna end up with something super sweet. So chuck their byproducts to this whole process. Essentially, molasses is chief among them. Yeah, I never knew that. Yeah, it's a byproduct that comes from boiling sugar, right, yeah, I mean it's it's basically the Yeah, it's it's it's the dark like that. That's what makes brown sugar dark, or sugar in the raw dark is molasses. Right. The molasses isn't extracted as much as it is with refined white sugar. Fine white sugar has zero molasses in it, like sugar in the raw has more and more. It's less refined um and then the greatest byproduct of molasses is of course rum. Yeah yeah, I put a little molasses in my when I make melin barbecue sauce. Oh yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's nice. Another byproduct is called gas, and that is um the pulp essentially of the cane. Are you making these words up? No? Those are rewards what mother looking in bagas? But gas we I think another process we studied. It's not it's not central just to sugar. It's just the pulpy fibrous matter leftover from this kind of process. I wonder what we talked about that and was it? Was it coffee? Now maybe maybe maybe? But the ba gas is used is a big gas because I think I remembers discussing whether it's a big gas or by gas. It's big gas. I listened to it today. Um yeah, we definitely cover that before. I'm starting to feel like an old man because when you when we have seven undertopics or so oh yeah, literally vaguely familiar, but yeah, I want to sound dumb, so you don't say anything, and they just spend the next week and going over this. I'm telling you, one day we're going to rerecord a show and not realize it, man, and we're going to hear about it. Well, what was it? It was crystal skulls. We never release that one, right, But remember I was like, I thought for sure we recorded this, no dreams, what it was. We went to record dreams and we just were it just wasn't there. Yeah. Uh so, but gas we definitely talked about. And the gas is a great byproduct because that can be used to power the sugar refinery. They actually burned that as fuel to create the steam used to power some of these machines. So that is one way that sugar production can be green. Um. However, mass production of anything like this isn't super green because they're transporting stuff over large distances and there's clear cutting of land. Well that's a big one with with sugar. Yeah, deforestation like in the Amazon, right, and yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah. So even though they're using things like the gas as a byproduct to help power why is that funny? Because I always hear by gas and my head okay anytime you say it. But it is not a looked upon as one of the more green products that is used and produced, you know, like they have to use baby lambs to really refine it to its whitest. Not true. Well, it uses their souls at least, I guess, if you want to get technical, the souls of baby lambs, and then they're just left to wander the earth for the rest of their natural lives, like not feeling anything. So there's a lot of types of sugar. There are. Um, when you think about sugar, especially here in the West, you think, oh, that really white, like really pretty powdery granular stuff, and that's called will sugar, and that's what's known as sucros. That's right, And sucros is glucose and fruit toast. Sucros also apparently occurs naturally. There's a lot of different types of sugar that you're gonna find in plants, uh, and from some animals too. Yeah. Yeah, So cow's milk contains lactose and gullactose, both of which are sugars um sucros. Again, that's typically table sugar, but I believe you can find that in plants, and that's glucose and fructose what you said, Yeah, and it's even one molecule glucose, one molecule fruit toast. Put them together, you've got sucros, fruit toast is commonly found in fruits. Yeah. Uh, it's also found in honey fruit tastes. And then, um, glucose. This is the one you commonly think of when you think the body and sugar, because glucose is what the body ones on. And we'll talk about that a little more in depth than a little bit. Yeah, and that's in honey and fruits and veggies. And then something called zylos, which I've never heard of, that's in wood and straw. It's pretty interesting. Yeah, there's a sugar alcohol called zilattle. Yeah, that's very sweet. Yeah. There's sugar alcohols and they supposedly um circumvent your blood sugar, your normal metabolic blood sugar process, so they taste sweet, but they don't have any impact on your blood sugar. And one of them is called zio Litle. Zio litle, and that's the name of the product. Yeah. There's this uh Danish or Swedish gum that's like the best sugar free gum you can possibly get your hands on. It's called Ziolidle. It's so good. Terrible name though it is, but it's named after the sugar, which apparently is based on I guess it's probably would sugar alcohol. Wow, yeah, it's pretty creative. I didn't. I'm just recounting here, so I know I know you did. You weren't complimenting me. Uh. Sugar comes in different granulations and from icing sugar, which is if you've ever heard of confection or sugar that you daintily sprinkle on top of your Um what's it called? What did you get at the fair? Your funnel cake? Those are so good? They are. I haven't had one year, so yeah, they're good. I never like I got. I don't indulge in that stuff. Man, what why is going on? Chuck? Well, you know, I'm I'm overweight and like it's there's just like you don't want to be the overweight guy walking up to the funnel cake stand, you know, Well that's why you sneak around the back, get someone else to go get it, and you eat in the alley. Cry. I've never done that. No, I avoid that stuff. Ice Cream is my big downfall. Oh it's your ice cream? What's your favorite? Um? Well, Ben and Jerry's sure like, but which one, Chubby Hubby? Oh it's a good one, ironically, Yeah, Um, I gotta tell you have you had Bluebell. Yeah, okay, Blue Bell is like the third best selling ice cream brand, like Country, but you can only get it in like seven states. That's how good it is. And um, they have a banana pudding flavor that is if you're in Nevada and you can't, the closest you can get it is in Mississippi. It's worth driving there for and it's like eight bucks for like a gallon or a half gallons, ridiculously expensive, but it is so good. All of their flavors are good, but their banana putting one is like it's just I'm about to cry. Yeah. There. Um, their radio commercials or have you heard those? The songs are horrible. Oh, it's the funniest stuff you've ever heard. The TV version of it is even worse. Yeah, it seems like a joke, Like are they serious or is this campy? Oh? They're serious. It's like an eighty five year old like braptist preachers in charge of like their it's it is. It's campy. It's so it's and they don't mean it. It is. For those of you who don't know the songs, it's literally like, you know, Mama's baking the apple pie and putting in the window sill and like the picket fences outside, and we're eating bluebell ice cream because it tastes like the good old days. It's really funny. It rhymes more than that, but that's just it. I'm sure it's on YouTube. Just type bluebell ice cream. Man. Yeah, it's good stuff. Um Man. That was a nice sidetrack. So then you got castor sugar, which is larger than powdered sugar but smaller than granulated sugar. Yeah, which I didn't know about until like a couple of months ago. I don't remember what recipe it was, but there was a recipe that you me was making that like called for castor sugar, and she was like what both of us were, Yeah, you apparently you can make it if like with the coffee grinder, you can grind your regular sugar. Yes, she came across that. I think you finally founder she ordered it online or something like that, but she making a merengue because they used a lot of meringues. Evidently I don't remember. Maybe I don't remember what did you need that for. I'll figure it out on my own time and let everybody know. In the next episode, how about that rather than all of us sitting here until I remember what the recipes and then I pick up the phone and collar and asked, right, that's good radio, my friend. Uh. Then you have your granulated sugar, and this is your table sugar. And then you've got preserving sugar, which looks sort of like sort of rock salty. It's chunkier or like sea salt. Course, sea salt sweeter than sea salt though, and that's used to preserve yes, much sweeter. Uh yeah, because that's another property of sugar is it's a preservative as well. Um, you can throw it into some jam if you want to make an extra sweet, but it will also keep the bacteria away at bay. That's right, which is why, like you said, simple syrup can last for so long. Yeah, you can just make that and put it on your bar at riom temperature. Right. Yeah, I can keep it in the fridge, but yeah, you keep it on hand, make it yourself. It's very easy. Plus also if you like toss some lavender in there, got lavender simple syrup which goes with anything with gin in it. Yeah, Oh it's so good. Um, you can put in some like all spice and some an a seed and stuff like that. Every lemon verbina, No, but I have made lemon like just from the the peel. Oh yeah, Lemon verbena is like just the green leaf. We grow a lot of that in the herb garden and if you smash it up, it smells so good, like I imagine it would be good muddled in a drink if I was into that. Are you not? You know that I'm not into the cocktails. I thought you were whiskey over ice. So you can jazz it up a little bit here there, No, not me, okay, Uh So I guess we should talk a little bit about high fruit toast corn syrup. We did a whole show on it, yeah, which you can go back and listen to. But it bears mentioning here because there's a lot of it gets a bad rap um and the evidence is sort of inconclusive right now. Yeah. Yeah, I think what we determined is it's not necessarily any worse feed than sugar, but it's in a lot more stuff and you may not know it. I don't remember what we concluded. What my understanding is at this point, and that was from two thousand nine. Um, there's a really great article on the New York Times called It's sugar toxic. It's very long, but it's very in depth, and it really goes into the um the evidence that's out there that it really is the highlights. Well, like you said, high fruit toast corn syrup isn't molecularly different very much from sucrose, which is sugar. Most high fruit toast corn syrup, or the stuff that's most widely used, is like fifty fruit toasted glucoast. So that five difference um in fruit toast shouldn't make much difference, but apparently it does. The other aspect of high frue toast corn syrup is that that extra fructoast are all that fruit toast that is processed in the liver. Any cell in your body can process glucose. When you eat something that has glucose in it, uh, your pancreas releases insulin, and insulin goes hey open up cells and the glucose goes in and it's converted. It's biochemical energy is converted to a t P and then you have this packet of energy that can be used by any cell. Any cell can do that, which means your entire body can metabolize glucose. Fruit toast has to be broken down into glucose, and that's done in the liver. The liver has some options to it chuck. When it's presented with fructast. It can use it for energy, it can convert it into fats in the blood stream, which are called triglycerides, or it can convert it into fat stores fat. That's if you have too much of it, right, Yeah, Now, with high fru toast corn syrup, apparently evidence shows that when it hits the liver, it's just automatically converted to fat, and that the speed with which it's metabolized also has an effect on how much or how frequently it's converted to fat. And with high fruit toast corn syrup, it's syrup, and syrup apparently hits the liver a lot faster than say, an equal amount of apples that you're getting fruit toast from, so it's being converted to fat like automatically. That's why they think that high fruit toast corn syrup is actually far worse from you than just regular fruit toast or even sucros table sugar. Right, while the obesity epidemic is sort of matched year to year with the introduction of high fruit toast corn syrup as far as increase um. So that makes sense. I read an article to Day that said that added sugars overall is the problem, whether it's high fructose corn syrup or regular added sugar. Well, that's added sugars in a product. That's the U s d a's line, and the U s d A doesn't want to upset the sugar industry or the Corn Refiners Association, So that's kind of become the predominant government line, like, yeah, everybody's eating too much sugar, that's the problem. Well, then there's a whole group of people out there who are saying, like, no, it's it's yeah, sure that's a problem, but this is a an even bigger problem with high fructose corn syrup. Yeah, that makes sense that it's different and it's affecting people differently, right, and it's not the same as sugar. Well, I think a lot of people think we're ingesting too much corn based products. Period. We need to do g MS at some point too. You know, yeah, everyone keeps calling for it. Some guys sent us a book, Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah. Did you read it? No, I haven't read it um. Apparently six of americans calories come from added sugars, which is just like totally empty calories. So again there's a there's a big there's an argument over those numbers. Yeah, no one really knows, but supposedly the numbers are very artificially low. UM and that the average American eats about nine pounds of sugar a year. Oh yeah, yeah wow, and the global average is something like UM sixty six pounds, but Israel eats something like a d forty five pounds per person per year. What what that's from sweets? Yeah, packaged foods Um. Are we done with HFCs then for now? Yeah, I go back and listen to the episode. It was a good one, one of my favorites. Yeah, it's been a while. I'm meant to re listen to that, but I didn't get a chance. Um, So sugar in the body we've been This also a hearkens back to our episode on taste it uh corresponds molecularly on your with your taste buds on the tongue because of the shape of the molecule. We talked about that the molecules are shaped to fit. You know, when sugar hits it, it matches up perfectly with that molecule and sends a message said, hey, there's something sweet as opposed to salty or bitter or sour or umami. Five? Right, this is four, and then names five, which I thought was I even changed it on my sheet. Um And they recommend something that I do not recommend, which is, if something tastes sweet in the wild, it's more likely to be safe to eat than something bitter. Sort of true. But you should never ever go and like in a survival scenario and just try and eat something even a little bit. Um. There's a test you can do which I won't get into, but it involves like rubbing on your skin first, waiting a certain amount of time. They may be touching it to your tongue, waiting a certain amount of time. But you should never just go like, I wonder if this is edible, let me taste it? Right, It's not a good idea good going even if it is sweet. You're a survivalist. I know some things. So you know. We said sugar is found in all plants, just to varying degrees. Um And plants create sugar is a byproduct of photosynthesis, and they use it for energy for growth. They also use it to they take sugars and turn them into more complex sugars to use for like um cellular structure like cellulose um. But they also use sugar in their nectar to tract bees and other things to help them pollinate. Yeah, and and propagate their species because it's sweet stuff. Yeah. I love it when I see the little bee getting in there getting a little something sweet. Yeah. I feel like they're getting a little treat, you know, that's right, And then they're vomiting it up and we eat it as honey. That's true. Uh, sugar is bad for your teeth. Everyone knows that. Um. Specifically, when you eat sugar, it's gonna form something called a glyco protein, that little sweater on your teeth. And bacteria love to eat that stuff and then they love to poop out lactic acid afterwards, unto your teeth. Yes, specifically, stripped a caucus mutans. That's the culprit for cavities. Really, we've said stripped a caucus before, and that's not a good word. No, But there's different kinds of strap okay, um, But when they poop out that lactic acid, that's what's on your enamel, that's what's gonna wear it on your teeth. So eating sugary stuff really is bad for your teeth. That's not like something your mom tells you. That's a lie. And the bacteria also provided or produces a biofilm around all of this stuff which traps it in there and traps in the lactic acid as well. So you're in trouble. Yeah you're dead, not dead, but you make it diabetes. Yeah, you can get diabetes UM from too much sugar and that that apparently is um. It's crazy that there's a real parallel between the six country study in the seven country study that we talked about. In the Paleo diet episode of fats, apparently there was a rival all along that said it's not fat, it's sugar. Like we're both after the same problem. But this guy went after fats, this other guy went after sugar. And now they're starting to think, like now that they're thinking it's not fats after all that contributed to like heart disease and obesity that they think is actually sugar. And the the way that it's sugar is through something called metabolic syndrome, to where if you eat too much sugar, your body becomes resistant to insulin. And remember insulin gets glucose out of the blood stream and into your cells and is converted to energy. Well, if your body starts sucking at doing that, then you have a lot more glucose in your blood stream, which means your pancreases producing more and more insulin. Insulin remember, triggers fat storage, so you have more and more insulin, you have more and more fat storage, You have obesity, you have heart disease, and they think that possibly the number one contributor to heart attacks is metabolic syndrome and not necessarily saturated fats. Right. Interesting, But as a result of this aside result is insulin, you develop your diabetes. Type two diabetes is the result of insulin resistance where you have to inject insulin into your body because your body is not producing enough any longer because it's overtaxed your pancreases. Yeah, we got a lot of great responses from the Paleo episode. It was a really interesting one. Yeah, and people saying, like, dudes, we know so little still about nutrition and things are changing so much with the things we eat and put in our body that it's hard to keep up, which is why it's so insulting when some industry that has a vested interest in so they got all figured out. Yeah, and don't worry about it, just keep eating it. You know that that's that's insulting. All right? Can sugar power your car? Yes? How I'll explain. There's a couple of ways. Um, So there's sugar based ethanol, which Brazil was basically running on for many years. I didn't realize that they're big into flex fuels and ethanol. They were basically energy independent in the first decade of the twenty one century because they said, we're tired of being dependent on foreign oil. Yeah, let's figure something out. And they did. They put all they Yeah, they started looking into sugarcane, making ethanol from sugarcane, and you know there's like corn based ethanol, which um, Chris Pallette and I talked about in the Grass Lena episode, remember that. And apparently ethanol made from sugarcane as eight hundred times more energy output, and so they were making ethanol in it. In two thousand eight of the fuel sold in Brazil was ethanol. That's awesome, made from sugarcane right there in the country. Well then gas prices lowered and um people started using gas again because they'll use whatever's cheapest. But Brazil, even though it's on its heels, the ethanol industry there is they proved it's a completely viable alternative fuel. Yeah. The problem though, again with UM refining more and more sugar for these purposes is the deforestation and worker wages. And I feel like anytime we've covered any commodity like this, there's some workers somewhere in the world getting screwed over, and sugar is definitely not any stranger in that process. Well. Also, it drives up food prices too, yeah, um, because if if there's two different huge sectors competing for the same commodity like there, it's going to drive the price of that commodity up. Yeah, that's true. So if you have energy and food right going after sugar prices, sugar goes up. Right. I wish people could have seen that demonstration. It really brings it home. Uh. And what else is the other I remember I think we talked about this too, Uh, sugar devouring microorganisms basically feeding on sugar and making energy in the process. Yeah, that's a like viable, viable way in the future, maybe to power things. Yeah, so there's a certain certain types of microbes are more sugar hungry than others. But yeah, when they're eating sugar, they managed to separate electrons and loosen loosen electrons, and as the electrons flow, as we mentioned in our electricity episode, the flow of electrons is electricity. So if you direct that flow across like some something that can use it, you create a current. And the cool thing about microbial fuel cells is when that electron makes it to the other side, it um combines to form water. So that's the byproduct like this, so it it truly is a very um environmentally friendly alternative fuel. Yeah, we did. We covered that at some point too. I remember, it's our world is getting smaller because we're explaining it. That's right. You got anything else? No, I don't think so, mother, liquor, BA gas, all these words I made up just for the show. You did good with the making up the words, man, Thanks. Yeah, I don't have anything else, chuck um. But if you want to learn more about sugar, I'm sure there's some words we left out of this article. You can type sugar into the search bar at how stuff works dot com. Um, and uh, since I said search parts time for a listener mail, I'm gonna call this refuting listener mail. We read a listener mail from a creationist not too long ago, man that got a certain response from some quarters. Yeah, so then a lot of people right and responding to that listener mail. So we might just continue this for the next year just reading rebuttals. H. Hey, guys, you received an email from a creation that's explaining that both creationists and scientists believe in natural selection, and that both groups believe in micro evolution but disagree on macro evolution. What the person did not mention is that macro and micro evolution describe the same process of natural selection, just on different timetables. Uh. Micro a short term, macros long term. It simply does not make sense that natural selection works on the short term, but it's somehow reversed on the long term. Natural selection introduces changes to a population subgroup as they adapt to their environment, but the changes are small the population subgroup can naturally breed with the original population. That is micro revolution. Once it changes are significant enough that the subgroup can no longer naturally and successfully breed with the parent population. The subgroup is considered a new species, that's a special event, that it's macro evolution. To believe in micro and not macro is to ignore how nature works. Say you put two separate populations of the same species put in very different environments. Each population would slowly adapt to its new environment and change over time micro evolution, each group will become better adapted to its new environment, and the differences between the two groups will only grow in time. However, if you don't believe in macro revolution, you don't believe in new species. So you have to believe that no matter how different each group becomes, nature does not work like this. Also, the previous writer claimed to be a creationist botanist, and that is like a doctor that does not believe in germ theory. I'm sure they might exist, but I would definitely take their expertise with a large dose of salt. Quite a rebuttal. Yeah, and I didn't have a name. I feel bad, so I'm just I'm gonna say thanks you, thanks Richard Dawkins. I appreciate that. So the evolutionists have rebutted, what say you creationists? Let us know, and everybody stopped tweeting and sending emails about how dare we put a creationists views on and listener mail? Yeah. Yeah, it's no way to go through life trying to silence your opponents. Yeah, your debate and engage. I was surprised there were a lot of people that said you shouldn't give equal time to this stuff because it's just not true. Yeah. Somebody said, Um, I thought discovery stood for something interesting. Yeah, well, hey, I think debate is healthy and they think you're not right either, So like you know, yep, debate is healthy. Chuck exactly. Um. If not, Bill and I wouldn't have done it, boom. If you want to contribute to the debate, we want to hear from you. You can tweet to us at s y s K podcast.
