Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles, Chuck Bryant and us. We were together and there's a couple of microphones in front of us. This is stuff, as you know, all that separates us to some cheap bone yeah, and metal in the table and some clean X and Y and this I keel lamp from the lamp. So there's actually a lot between us. It's come to think of it, this box of chalk. Yeah, what's that here for? I don't know. There's some really uninteresting things on this table, the playroom in here. Well, we screwed this one up already. Great, Um, nowhere to go but up. That's a great way to look at this, Chuck. Yeah, that's great. I'm not going to use it as a segway, but it's a really good positive way of looking at things. Okay you, um, Chuck, what do what does the cities of Boston, Massachusetts, Calgary, Canada? Boot where is it in Canada? Edmonton? Okay? Edmonton? Uh? And a little town called Palmer, Alaska have to do with one another. I love when you do this. Um, I have no idea. Actually, I mean they're all cities or towns in the northern hemisphere North America. Are you ready for the answer which destroys your guests? All three cities recently voted to remove or stop adding Florida to their water supply. Okay, do you know that? I did not, But we've covered that before. We have. We we got a little um overboard, possibly in our disdain for floride, did we Maybe? Who knows. I thought it was a good one. I still will stand by most of it because we're in our younger days. Yeah, are headier days. But um, so there's three towns that are starting to wake up because the well that it's not it's not really a conspiracy theory as much. It's more, um, apparently people are buying their fluoride. Cities are buying their fluoride from China, and the Chinese fluoride is subpar and it's starting to like gom up the city water works. So they're like, we either need to find a good supplier or else we need to stop adding flooride. And everybody said, you know what, let's stop adding fluoride. There's not even real evidence that it works to prove a tooth decay. Okay, so I'm with you. That's one major government conspiracy down dead, onto the next one. Right, we're gonna talk about camp trails. Yeah, we handle these occasionally. We have a video podcast. It's not our own, but our our fellows uh college here, uh stuff. They don't want you to know, right, they tackle these conspiracy things and it's a lot of fun. Matt and Ben, they know what they're doing. We try to avoid it because a lot of times I just don't want to be the guy that poopoo's everything and or the guy that is the conspiracy dude. But we're gonna tackle it today because people have asked for kim trails over and over. Yeah. Yeah, so, um, we're gonna talk about it and we're gonna handle it very well. Let's let's talk about this, so just to get everybody on the same page, a chem trail, depending on who you are, who you're talking to, um, is either a chem trail or a contrail. And let's talk about contrails first. That's what the f a A would call it. You know those streaks in the sky that follow a plane. Lovely ones outside my window today. That's great. They're essentially man made serious clouds, right. Yeah. What happens is when you are in a jet plane, your jet engine produced is very very hot. Um air is exhaust sure um. Also included in that very very hot air is water vapor. And if you are flying in an airplane very high up say thirty thou feet, the ambient temperature, atmospheric temperature is going to be about negative forty degrees, which is the same it's Celsie sanfair well remember celsie height. Yes, um. So when you have uh, there's also lower lower atmospheric pressure. And if you also have thrown in there saturated air, humid air, very humid, the vapor pressure, which is the pressure that gas exerts on its surrounding environment. When you have that all combined, you have what amounts to a man made cloud. A contrail. Yeah, condensation. Condensation, that's an even better way to put it. It's it's water droplets or a lot of times, but not always, as our author says, it turns into ice. It doesn't always turn into ice. Sometimes it's just water, but a lot of times it will crystallize into ice if it's cold enough. And that's what you're seeing contrails, condensation trails shortened to contrails. Um, So problem solved. They dissipate. Yeah, eventually it depends if you, um, if you're in drier areas, Um, it's going to dissipate more quickly. As Jay McGrath, who wrote this article points out, Um, if you've ever been out on like a very cold day and it was very humid and cold, your you can see your breath far longer. It takes far longer to dissipate then, Um, it does on a cold, dry day. That's right. That's because the air is less saturated and hence the vapor pressure is um higher on a dry day. That's right. And in this exhaust or contrail, if you will, you're gonna find carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, shot sulfate, and uh. Most scientists agree, if not all, I haven't talked to all of them yet, still got like three three people to go. Uh, they agreed that this extra cloud cover essentially can be bad for the environment. Yeah, there was a that's not debated very much right now. No, there's a study that was released that basically estimates that um it just in one year, the energy trapped by contrails um is about was about a third of all of the energy trapped in the history of aviation um from greenhouse gas emissions of planes. So like, these contrails are like apparently a really big problem as far as climate change goes in creating the greenhouse effect. Well, there's a lot more UH flights going on now than ever before, a lot more than there were twenty and thirty and forty years ago, obviously, Yes, so yeah, it's an issue. So that's what a contrail is, and they are ventially problematic. UM that mystery should be lying there dead. I mean, they're just not really a mystery. It's like you can explain it through science. Apparently the f A, A, NASA, other aviation agencies, Northrop Grumman probably UM has said, here is exactly what's going on. And whenever you lay something out and you do it in a very forthright UM way, a lot of times conspiracy theorists think you're lying, you're making something up. Sure, so a lot of conspiracy theories have cropped up, and basically most conspiracy theorists say, yes, I understand there's such thing as contrails. Stop trying to humiliate me. But have you noticed that contrails stick around way longer than they used to? That is, uh, we'll do a little before after with this, they say. They say that kim trails is let's go ahead and just let the cat out of the bag. They're calling these kim trails, and they're saying they're there doping the fuel, essentially lacing it with chemicals. Myrriad reasons that will go over here in a second, and these chemicals make it stick around longer, that's what they say. It's it's telltale evidence that there are chemicals, as you say, they're the planes exhausts are being doped with this stuff. Uh gosh, I wish I had this guy's name. M A atmospheric scientists that I've looked up earlier said this is one of the biggest claims that kim trailers, as he calls it, gets wrong. He says, Uh, contrails can persist for hours as well. They've done so since we've had jet planes. Um, if you look at old photographs from the sixties and seventies, you're gonna see contrails in the sky just like we see today there are a lot more of them now because there's a lot our flights. And he said, uh quote often when persistent contrails exist from feet, several long contrails uh increase in number and gradually will merge into an almost interlaced solid sheet. And he said, this happens, it's a contrail, and that can happen with a contrail and go ahead. A Kim Trailers would say, that's a sheet, purposeful sheet of chemicals being laced over the world in the atmosphere. And we all know why forty feet is the limit that that scientists cited. Yeah, we went over that to me. Yeah. Um, so here's I guess the crux of the of the problem. There's there is this thing that everybody agrees is there. We're all looking at it as it's there, But why is it there? And um, it's very tough to explain to a conspiracy theorist that what they believe is incorrect, especially when you can't take them and show them, you know, the plane that nobody's doping it. Yeah. Another guy I read said, you know, when we try to explain this to them, they say, you're just part of the conspiracy, which I mean kind of shuts down any intelligent conversation about it right there, but it opens up some fantastic speculation. So UM, if people if the government, usually it is the government that's tasked with UM or that's accused of doping plane exhausted UM. If the government we're doing that's why why would they possibly be doing this? And there's here's where we get to like the myriad reasons this is great. Yeah, they range, I mean there's a lot of reasons, but they range from UH, population control, essentially killing the sick and the elderly quicker with these mysterious flues. Right, and this this coincides with belief in the New World Order UM, where basically there there is a movement it's an alleged movement toward UM controlling the population more UM. Basically it's eugenics on a global scale. But apparently China is being left out. I went on this one chem trail UM conspiracy theorist I guess a chem trailer website, and the author was saying, like, there's no such you never see a chem trailer in China because the in w O is like grooming China to be like the premier country. So and just like this one sentence or two, this guy really laid a lot of stuff on the table. You have, like the nWo, the rise of China, and chem trails all in like one sentence. Was the Illuminati in there anywhere? I didn't search for it, but it's possible. Well that's one reason, okay, so population control, they're killing people off. Another reason is that we are experimenting with weather control for defense purposes. But this is we have done before. England has done this. We talked about cloud seating and it was Operation Cumulus. I can't remember which one we talked about it, and it was it was early Yeah, anyway, Yeah, we'll just go over it again. Operation Cumulus. It was a cloud seating operation by the Royal Air Force in the fifties UM where they were experimenting with making it rain so that they could you know, flood enemy forces whatever. If you can control the weather, there's all sorts of great things you can do with it. And it actually worked and it worked way way too well. And as we talked about, like a lot of people died from flash floods and whole villages were just washed away, and the Royal Air Force went back home, and then the Ministry Defense denied it until two thousand one, So it's possible. China does it. China did it before the Olympics. Uh yeah, with silver Eye died. Yeah did it work there? Yeah? You just shoot silver eyed died or dry I saw or something, and it creates um the conditions needed to make it rain, for a cloud to become pregnant with rain, and then that it goes away. I love that term pregnant with rain or pregnant with anything that's not a baby. You know what I'm saying. Okay, Uh. Others will say that it is uh aluminum being shot into the air to reflect the the harmful rays of the sun to combat global warming, which would be a good use quote unquote, I guess um. And there is such a thing as chaff. You know what chaff is c H A F F. Chaff is released from the underbelly of a plane. And that is in fact, little aluminum needles um released into the air. But it's used. It's been used since World War Two by US in the Germans and anyone with any kind of advanced defense program military program, am too confuse uh enemy radar, Like hey, look, this is an actual object up here that you're going to fire your missile at, So don't fire at me. So there's such a thing's chaff, but it's not released through the exhaust. It's dumped out like your spraying crops. Huh. Well. Plus, also, if we're using that for defense purposes anti missile defense, why would a commercial air aircraft be launching it? I guess dropping chaff, as they say in the biziness. Yeah, so you know that's what chaff is, and that's a real thing. Contrails are real things. So this all kind of gets mixed together though in a in a conspiracy like manner. Um, And you were saying like that, there's an idea that the government is well intentionedly um trying to combat global warming. I have a feeling that like this would be well publicized. Yeah they would tell that. I would think, so, like, hey, well yeah, but I think the conspiracy theorist said, then then they would have to admit all the dangers of global warming. Um touche. You know, there's there's a rebuttal for for everything. It's a great game of ping pong. There is another one that I came across too, that is my personal favorite. Another reason. Let's hear um that the government probably the larger New World Order. Somebody is um manipulating organ. Okay, Oregon. Are you familiar with Kate Bush's song cloud Busting? No? Oh you're not. No. I like Kate Bush though. It's great. It's like her most famous song and like I feel like a healed No don't. Her video for it star Donald Pleasants as the dad. It was directed by Terry Gilliam And you can tell man, it's cool. Yeah, just just look up the video for cloud Busting a YouTube. Good song even, but it's a ballad. It's about this guy named will how Mich who um was an Austrian psychoanalyst who moved to the US and the fifties, and he claimed to have discovered this stuff called organ, which is a life energy that everything has basically like q um right yeah um, And there's a packet of organ that surrounds the earth and protects it and gives it life. Okay. So he apparently fell him really really badly with the f d A. They considered him like a huckster and a fraud because he was he was selling organ generators that would basically or organ accumulators that would you know, heal cancer grow like plants or whatever, and he did to your bit in jail. And I looked this up and I'm pretty sure it's accurate. The f d A banned and destroyed his books. Really, I didn't know that I can do that. So it looked even further, and it turns out the FDA destroyed, banned, and destroyed another book on cooking with Stevia. I'm not kidding. I looked and found it in several places that this really happened to this guy in Texas who wrote a natural food cookbook. UM. So apparently the FDA can burn your books if they want to. But anyway, Wilhelm Reich was jailed, UM, and he died in prison in nine seven. UM. But the I've came across this chem trail theorist idea that um, chem trails changed the polarity of the organ that surrounds the earth and affects us. So you can make You can make your own cloud busting machine at home for about five bucks from parts you can get at home depot. Yeah. Pretty cool. Yeah. If you go to educate en yourself dot org, you can find a chem buster schematics. I'll do it. I got five bucks to burn and look up the look up that Kate Bush song the video loan is really cool. Yeah, it sounds like it when they put some real money into music videos back in the day. What else, Josh got any other reasons? Well, then let's talk a little bit about Uh. Well, the United States actually did address this, because a lot of times they'll just not even give any credence to these conspiracy theories. But there were there were so many inquiries to this. The NASA, E P A and f A A and in O a A issued a joint back sheet and two thousand that explained everything and said, you know, here's the deal, here's your back sheet. This is official, and this is our official stance. I think the Air Force did something similar. Didn't do anything to dissuade anyone. No, and I'm sure and it catch twenty two. The fact that they did uncharacteristically break the silence and come forward just added fuel to the fire. Yeah, or strengthen the conviction of conspiracy theorists. When didn't you say? I think so. One of the things that the conspiracy theorists will point to with Kim Trail or let's just keep calling them kim trailers, so much easier. UH. They will point to the grid like patterns as mysterious as as setting it up so it will eventually form a complete coverage, you know, from day to day, and UH air traffic dudes will say, you know what, that's because of the our aerospace, our airspace systems, North south and east west flight lanes. That's how we send planes. So they're gonna criss cross like that and it's gonna look like a grid. Seems to explain things away pretty well. There was also josh A the news you know, local news, like they'll get on the case of something like this and get really excited, especially when weatherman and are involved, because they'll get like, all of a sudden they get to do one of those investigative reports that they never get to do. So in Shreveport, Louisiana at k s l A News twelve, they did a test because this UH guy said, you know what, I've noticed these unusual clouds that that just continue to fall until they reached the ground, and I'm collecting this water and we should examine, you know, testas water. So they was like, sure, of course we should and they tested it and found uh high levels of barrier at six point eight parts per million, which is more than three times a toxic level, and they said, we're onto something here because that is a hallmark of uh KIM trail testing. And then they found out they actually misread the report and it was six point um sorry, sixty eight parts per billion. Oh, not six point eight per million, but sixty eight pervillion, and it was well within the range. They retracted their story. Other local stations around the country picked up on that and then kind of had to watch the offer their face afterwards, or they just never mentioned it again without a follow up exactly. UH colors A lot of times these things will have vibrant colors. And UH I saw a show on our own Discovery channel called Best Evidence, and one of their atmospheric researchers said, that's just it's coloration. You're gonna get it. And you're on the ground, you can't tell, like getting back to the grid, you can't tell from the ground what atmosphere these things are at. So it looks like a criss cross right over each other might bet apart. And you're looking at this from the ground, you're looking at the colors like is a rainbow some vaste conspiracy as well. Somebody's got a conspiracy theory on that one, the rainbow. I think Kim Trails proved that there's a conspiracy theory on absolutely everything. Uh, that's true. Um, but this show, it was actually pretty good. It was called best Evidence. You can watch it on the YouTube's or maybe Discovery dot com is it, I don't know. And they actually tested stuff. They tested jet emissions in a lab for aluminum and UH tested them with atomic absorption spectrometers, and they also tested it in the air um with a land spectrometer and they found no aluminum in in the fuel or exhaust. However, the conspiracy theorists will say, well, you didn't get the doped fuel. You just tested regular jet fuel and not the secret jet fuel that the US government. And it's not just US, Canada and and and Britain and other countries UH have made these claims as well. So it's semi worldwide, but not in China evidently, because there's so such thing as a contrailer a Kim trail in China. They're the NWOS favorite. And then the dentist cscentach thing. Yeah tell me about this. I haven't heard he And this is something that the KIM trailers will point to in the UH that there was a bill introduced by Dennis Casinich, a dude I happened to like, and uh, the Space Preservation Act HR two seven, and it actually specifically banned KIM trails. And they said, see they use the word kim trails is the government act. It turns out it was not a bill that he had written. It was written by UFO enthusiasts. And some of the other things included in there that they wanted banned were, uh, plasma weapons, psychotronic weapons, extra terrestrial weapons, and climate weapons. Psychotronic weapons are real? Are they? I believe so? Like remember the guy who went to Waco and like was saying he could like play this jumbled sound and it would drive everybody out of the house. And FBI said, well, what happens if it doesn't work? And he said, they'll probably just slid each other's throats weapons. No, but it's what he had. The technology he created was real. Okay. Apparently the story behind this is Cassina didn't read the bill fully before he endorsed it, and then afterward he read it and said, uh, jeez, here we go. He rewrote it. Uh, and then the bill died then dropped in two thousand two, even after it was rewritten to omit all of the uh plasma weapons. Yeah, the gobbledy cook that's crazy. Wow. I think that's a great piece of history. Well, yeah, I do remember we talked about how contrails, whether their contrails, chemtrails, whatever, they seem to have um a very pronounced effect. You came across something, um at September eleven two one climate study. Yeah, that was I remember. They did study something because it's a really rare thing to not have any planes for a few days. Exactly, for three days, all air traffic in the United States was grounded. Yeah, and there was for for the first time since the history of the invention of the plane. Yeah, that's what I mean by exactly three straight days where there were no planes in this guy. So UM, a couple of people scrambled to um study any effects that happened, and uh they found that there they there was a diurnal temperature change, right. Um, well, it's the temperature difference between day and night and a single day. Um. They they observed at one point eight degree change from the other days the other three days sorry um, from the three days leading up to the eleventh and the three days following the fourteen. So that's pretty substantial in thirty years they had ever recorded, so that the contrails are real and they do have an effect. We just need to get rid of air travel. My deal when it comes and I said I wasn't gonna do this in here I go. My deal when it comes to any like conspiracy that's this vast and widespread where the airline industry is in on it, and the dudes on the ground and that work for Delta are you know and on this it's just it's so has to be so vast that uh, there would be some kind of proof and there's no evidence that I never have not found any single person that's ever come out and say, you know what, I was a part of this program. Now I can't remember what that's called. Where like the absence of evidence is evidence itself, But yeah, in this case, I would say that that's pretty strong. And one of the other things that Kim trailers will say is or or people that don't believe it will say, is, well, why are they doing this out in full view, like where everyone can see it, and they go exactly, of course they're going to do it in front of pull of you because any won't suspect anything. Well, the irony is that, um, there are chemicals that can be added to the jets exhaust, but not to create chem trails, but to keep contrails from forming. Really, yeah, the original stealth bomber um had this extra option to make it stealth. Yes, that makes sense. They figured out, No, you can just fly at a different altitude, stay away from wet areas, and our pilots know what they're doing, so they don't even use it or they didn't use it. But there's your irony right there for the episode. Well, and then the one of the guys on the Discovery show said, you can't add aluminum to jet fuel, like the plane wouldn't run, Like it wouldn't be able to handle that. Why are why are these fish not running my outboard motor? Right? And finally for me at least, Uh, the Rise and the Kim Trail conspiracy, although it had been around for a little while, really gained steam they say in two thousand, sort of coinciding with the massive pickup of of Internet, and not just that this stuff change to the millennium. I think everybody was really paranoid in like the decade leading up to that. I think about one of the number one shows of that decade, X Files. I love that show. This lady on the on the Best Evident show sent all these pictures of different Kim trails to one of the atmospheric researchers and she said, to see here, how this has become a sudden burst of a cloud. And this one's uh, it had come from this Kim trail and now it's a burst of a cloud. And he went, now that's a cloud, and that's a Kim trail that it intersects it or doesn't. Maybe it's off byet, but it's like, that's just a cloud, and this is this and this is that. And he explained every single picture. He's like, think, weird things happen. He depending on how high you are and how human it is, and how the engine of the plane is running. He said, they're gonna look different, and it's just easily explained. Chuck, Josh, you should be very proud of yourself because you helped take a two page, six hundred seven word article and turn it into a thirty minute plus podcast. Much chaff, So there you go without much silver needles. Hey you were you were half of that. I was less than that. You did good. So that's cam trails. If you want to read this article, you can type in cam trails C H E M T R A I L S if you've got three and a half minutes to burn right in the search bar. How stuff works dot com And I said search bar. So it's time for listener mail, Josh, I'm gonna call this. Uh, I've got my poop card. I'm not afraid to use it. Oh, this is a good one. You remember this is from Tina. Hi. Guys just listened to how the digestive system works and loved it. I've been waiting to have a cool reason to write in once again one of those, but never felt like I had any kind of expertise until you mentioned Crohn's disease. I was diagnosed in two thousand eight had surgery to remove a section of my small intestine. I had never heard of the disease until the doc told me he had removed fourteen centimeters of my intestine that have been severely affected by it. I was glad you mentioned what we're going through, and I can answer a question he raised. I'm a member of the crones and Colitis Foundation of America and they did send me a card that says I can't wait and it's an all caps to which I guess it is on the card and it explains on the card that have a medical condition that requires immediate need of the restroom. I keep it my wallet and it's coming handy for all those emergencies. My boyfriend thinks it's hilarious. I do too, actually, but it makes me feel better having it around just in case. I'd love to hear you read a part of this on the podcast done. It would make me and my poor crones infested shortened intestines so happy. And yes, I am playing the sympathy card. And then it's Tina, I can't wait card and asleep at the card. So there's a card. Yeah it took you, Uh you did a portion? Was that fourteen centimeters of her? You know? Is it proportion? That's what she said. Yeah, what she asked, if we'd read a portion of it got you? It wasn't that good? Like, um, okay, well, if you have had a significant part of your body removed. We'd like to hear about it. Um, you can tweet it to us. If the part is a hundred and forty characters are less, that's s Y s K podcast. One word. That's our Twitter handle.
