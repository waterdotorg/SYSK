00:00:01
iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:11
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Ben's here again too. It's pretty much the new status quo, which I have to say I like a lot, and that makes the stuff you should Know.

00:00:24
iHeart Intro: Oh. I was about to say Jerry might get her feelings hurt, but you know she won't even hear that.

00:00:28
Josh: No, not a chance.

00:00:29
iHeart Intro: If she's not, you know, overseeing that episode. It's not like she goes, oh, I should listen in.

00:00:35
Josh: Yeah, I got to keep up with these guys. They're so hilarious. That's not a Jerry thing to think.

00:00:39
iHeart Intro: Yeah, especially when it's more alien stuff.

00:00:43
Josh: Yeah, we've done a lot of alien stuff and by god, every second of it's been amazing. And I don't think this is going to be any different.

00:00:51
iHeart Intro: No, it's been a while, though we haven't. I feel like we kind of had a little grouping of those, you know, ten years ago or something.

00:01:00
Josh: I think it was like last year, but we did.

00:01:02
iHeart Intro: Was it really?

00:01:02
Josh: No, it was probably like within the last two years. We did that two parter on Project blue Book.

00:01:07
iHeart Intro: Oh sure, I just remember years ago at Comic Con. Did we do an alien thing there.

00:01:11
Josh: We did one on UFOs. Yeah, yeah, for sure, that's.

00:01:15
iHeart Intro: That's a brave thing for us to do at Comic Con for sure.

00:01:19
Josh: A lot of experts there. Yeah, yeah, So yeah, today we're talking about something that definitely has a lot to do with aliens, a lot to do with UFOs, but also really has a lot to do with social psychology, in sociology and history as a strange moment in time where there was a you can almost call it a trend, And I want to say right from the outset, we are in no way, shape or for mocking anyone who believes that they were abducted. After researching this, I fully understand that people who who believe they were abducted by aliens are traumatized by that experienceience and show all the symptoms of a traumatic experience, and then on top of that had the indignity of not being believed by anybody and probably talk down to fairly frequently. So we're going to try not to talk down. So I'm not in calling it a trend. I'm not trying to diminish the experience of anybody who's ever who believes they were abducted, and that it had an impact on their lives. But there was a period in time from about the nineteen sixties and seventies through to the nineties where there were a lot of people running around claiming to have been abducted.

00:02:38
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it's interesting. It's fascinating because it dawned to me when I was researching this, like, I just I haven't heard one of these in a long time.

00:02:47
Josh: No, And I looked up and saw a bunch of different places that people attribute that to the advent of ubiquitous camera phones.

00:02:56
iHeart Intro: Uh, that's inconvenient.

00:02:58
Josh: Yeah, exactly. You can be like, nope, this is what you saw. So it dried up at almost the exact same time.

00:03:05
iHeart Intro: Okay, all right, that makes a lot of sense.

00:03:08
Josh: But before that there was like people have been seeing weird stuff in the sky and being like UFO for a while. But in our Project blue Book episode we found like the moment it really kicked off, and that was June twenty fourth, nineteen forty seven, and we talked it up to a guy named Kenneth Arnold who was a I think an amateur pilot or like a hobbyist who saw what came to be considered the first flying saucer.

00:03:35
iHeart Intro: Yeah. And the alarming thing about this was he clocked the speed at about sixteen hundred miles an hour, which is at the time, you know, easily three times faster than anything else could fly. And this is where the term saucer came from. He said, they flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water. And so that's kind of where that term came from. And this is you know, this is just after World War Two and it's not like any no one had ever claimed to have witnessed anything before this, but basically pre this date it was one hundred percent well maybe not hundred percent, who knows, but most people were saying like, oh, that's just you know, some enemy technology or something that we don't know about.

00:04:20
Josh: Yeah. So Kenneth Arnold kicked off what you characterize as like the modern UFO movement, I guess right.

00:04:28
iHeart Intro: Yeah, as in, there's an alien driving not a Russian.

00:04:32
Josh: Yes, yeah, good point.

00:04:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:04:33
Josh: And also the thing that really bolstered it within days of that, within two weeks, the Roswell Crash happened, which a lot of people say that's the advent of the idea that aliens are actually visiting us and that the government is covering it up right, So those two things. It was a one two punch in nineteen forty seven, in the summer of nineteen forty seven that really kind of just debuted aliens to the world. And one of the things is we'll see with abduction narratives or stories or claims, they usually have a very dark, bad thread to them. They're not a positive experience, and aliens have kind of gotten in large part like that kind of view by the public. If there are aliens out there, it's not entirely clear that they are benevolent or kind. But that's not how it was at the outset, was it.

00:05:29
iHeart Intro: Yeah, we can chalk that up to a dude named George Adomski. I guess Adamski, Yeah, he was. He immigrated from Poland and he founded a group called the Royal Order of Tibet in southern California in the thirties. He was a teacher of philosophy. He was, you know, he was kind of out there a little bit, and in nineteen fifty two he claimed that he met an alien named Orthan, which is I mean, it's got to be the inspiration from orson from work from work.

00:06:01
Josh: Right, probably because these were really popular books at the time.

00:06:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean it just sounds like you're saying morek calling Orthon with a lisp, yeah, or how I say it now with my tooth.

00:06:12
Josh: It's like Tyson calling Orthan.

00:06:15
iHeart Intro: But his narrative was a bit different. He was like, Hey, this alien Orthan was a beautiful man. He had a high forehead, he had hair which is, as you'll see, pretty unusual from the grays that follow, and a uniform on a brown uniform, and you know, was telepathic, could like speak to him basically through his brain and brought a message of peace, saying, hey, I'm from Venus and you guys should stop with the nuclear weapons.

00:06:45
Josh: Right. So this was like how people kind of viewed aliens visiting us at the time, Like this guy was writing these books like they were nonfiction and people were eating them up.

00:06:56
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:06:57
Josh: So there was this idea that aliens are kind of cool, they're more advanced than us, and they have our best interests in mind. And then that took a serious, like left turn just a few years later in the late fifties, when a farmer in Brazil named Antonio vs. Boas claimed that he had been taken aboard a spaceship and a damski later claimed that he had been on a spaceship too, But this was pretty new stuff that he had basically been abducted and forced to have sex with what he admitted was an attractive alien, but was a bit turned off by the fact that she barked during sex and then returned to his farm. And this was a this is a brand new this is new ground essentially that Boaz had started to trod.

00:07:47
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, I mean, this is I couldn't find an earlier one that mentioned any kind of you know, sexual assault going on, right, was this the first one from what I could tell? Yes, all right, so he was of course, went to a doctor, They examined him. They said, he's probably making this whole thing up. But there was a group a UFO, an early ufology group, that published this experience anyway, and in nineteen sixty five it ran in an international journal called Flying Salcer Review, which I get to copy of one of those, and all of a sudden, you know, people all over the world are hearing this story and this sort of you know was happening in you know, it was international, but it wasn't It didn't hit The American public quite liked this story of Betty and Barney Hill, which really really kicked things off here in the States.

00:08:44
Josh: Yeah, because his thing came out in the Journal in nineteen sixty five and the Hill the Hills had an experience in nineteen sixty one. They are widely seen as the first credible abductees. If you believe that kind of stuff, you probably are focused on Betty and Barney Hill. They were an interracial couple in nineteen sixty one in New Hampshire. Betty was a social worker and Barney was a postal officer, and they had taken a delayed honeymoon to Montreal and were on their way back when they noticed that they were basically being chased by a light in the sky. And when they grabbed their binoculars and stopped and got out of the car, they could actually see that it was essentially a flying saucer and that aliens were looking at them through the windows. And the next thing they know, it's five am. They're pulling into their house about three hours later than they had expected to, and Barney's shoes were scuffed and Betty's dress was torn and they didn't know what had happened, but they were genuinely bothered by the experience.

00:09:49
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and you know, we'll dive in a little bit more with them. But the reason that you mentioned that they were an interracial couple is because they were doing a lot of work for civil rights and stuff like that. So they all that to say, they had no reason to, in fact, every reason not to kind of come forward with this crazy story given their positions of doing like this, you know, great civil rights work, because you know, it would just all of a sudden people would call them kooks and probably cast doubt on, you know, the genuine good work they were doing. So they had no reason to make something like this up.

00:10:24
Josh: And everything to lose too.

00:10:26
iHeart Intro: Yeah, everything to lose. So they're trying to figure out and make sense of what had happened to them, because again, as you'll see with all these stories, whether or not this happened or not almost does it matter in some cases, because the trauma that's visited upon them afterward is very much real, just like any kind of potential false memory. So Betty starts researching, goes to the library and starts looking at books from the ni CAP which we've talked about before. Yeah, NIGHTCAP the National Investing Aations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon and that's you know, that was some retired military officers and you know UFO enthusiasts who had gotten together this you know, pretty early research group. And afterward they were, you know, they were suffering from PTSD, especially the husband he was he had pretty severe anxiety from this.

00:11:22
Josh: Yeah he did. Betty had trouble sleeping, Barney had a bunch of anxiety. They just they were affected by this experience and they had this missing time that they knew they couldn't account for, and they wanted to know what happened. So they were they were earnestly trying to look for somebody to help explain what had happened to them and why their lives were affected. First, they went to the military and followed official channels because this is when Project Blue Book was an actual thing, and like you were encouraged to report any UFO citing to the military because they were investigating it. And the military was like, you know, this is not an important story, sorry, guys, we can't help you. So they turned to their and apparently their church was like this is way out of our league. Yeah, maybe you saw God. And they're like, Noah, wasn't God. They're like, yes, sorry, we can't help you either. So they turned to psychiatry, and a psychiatrist named Benjamin Simon agreed to help them. And this is a time where you were there was a good chance you were going to be hypnotized if you were on a psychiatrist's couch. This is the early to mid nineteen sixties. And so they were hypnotized over a series of sessions, and all of a sudden, these these memories have been repressed, that covered that chunk of time where that they couldn't account for started to come forward.

00:12:39
iHeart Intro: That's right, which was abduction. Yeah, little great creatures. You know, this is the sort of the beginning of the stereotypical gray as we know them, gray, little skinny bodies, the big heads, the big oval eyes. They brought them on board the spaceship and did the you know, the usual kind of stuff, which is, let me probe you, let me sample you. Apparently they put a needle into Betty's stomach, which is what they assumed was like a pregnancy test. They were very entranced by Barney's dentures, and then they wiped their memories out. I guess men in black style, and that's where the lost time comes from. And these were like, these were real deal, super emotional hypnosis sessions with a very qualified psychiatrist. But even after all that, the psychiatrists Sigmon was like, I don't know, I think they have a shared delusion going on exactly.

00:13:37
Josh: Yeah, So he was like, you guys weren't abductive, but you both believe you were abducted and it's having an effect on you. He actually drilled down a little further and suggested that it was actually latent racial tensions that existed in their marriage that they were equipped to deal with and were purposely kind of subverting into these weird you know, alien face fans. But that really that's what it was. And they were like, no, dude, you're wrong, we were abducted. All of these memories are real. And he's like, have you heard of false memories? And the Hills were like, no, we haven't, and they just kept moving on. So the psychiatry couldn't help them either. And as they went further and further along trying to get answers, they kind of were pushed further and further out of the mainstream and toward the fringes, where they were welcomed with open arms.

00:14:23
iHeart Intro: Oh, of course, the story got published. In nineteen sixty five, a guy named John Lutriel from The Boston Traveler reported on this UPI picks it up, and then a guy named John G. Fuller made it into a book in nineteen sixty six called The Interrupted Journey Colan Two Lost Hours Aboard a Flying Saucer, which eventually became a TV movie in nineteen seventy five called The UFO Incident, which you can watch on YouTube if you want to see a relatively young and you know, pretty in great shape James Earl Jones movie. Did you watch it? I'd kind of scrub through it looking for the good stuff.

00:15:04
Josh: I didn't watch it this time. I watched it when I was younger, for sure.

00:15:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it like most of the movie, like eighty five percent of it, looks like it takes place in the psychiatrist's office, for sure. And I didn't see just scrubbing through any good alien stuff till kind of toward the end. I guess they were just wanted to wait to for the big reveal or whatever. But Stelle Parsons's plays the Wife and Barnard Hughes from Doc Hollywood. He was the old doctor in Doc Hollywood played Simon. And it was a big deal movie. And it was like, you know, it's a t moo movie at a time when TV movies were big. It's if you're around these days and you're not familiar with how things were back then, a big TV movie like this could be a sort of a national phenomenon.

00:15:53
Josh: Yeah, Because I mean, you had a very limited amount of choices of what to watch on any given night. So if there's a big TV movie, they promoted the heck out of it, and all the the whole country could be talking about it for the next couple of weeks. You'd be reading about it in the newspaper. It would be a big deal, right, So yeah, and this was a big deal too. You mentioned that there wasn't much alien stuff in there, and apparently Betty Hill was very disappointed that James Earl Jones and the producers had kind of taken this story that to her was a legitimate alien abduction story and used it to explore the themes of like interracial marriage, civil rights, being black in a largely white state Barney's general experience as being a black man in the in the sixties, and she was like, yeah, that probably has something to do with it, but really we need more aliens, right. It had a huge hard to argue with that exactly. And it had a huge effect too because it kicked off so everything we know about alien abductions, the whole narrative, the whole thread, all the claims that followed are based largely on Betty and Barney Hill's experience.

00:17:03
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and it should come as no surprise that after that movie airs, a lot more of these stories start to pop up. Very famous one just a couple of weeks later after the movie aired nineteen seventy five, is when the logger Travis Walton in Arizona was you know, beamed up into that spaceship became a movie Fire in the Sky in nineteen ninety three. He was gone for about a week, came back said that he was examined by what we would now call the Grays, a little short baldies. Yeah, and it just, you know, things really start to ramp up, almost in lockstep with stories ramping up, if that makes sense, Like we're kind of feeding each other.

00:17:46
Josh: Yeah. By the way, Travis Walton was roundly exposed as a hoaxter and so was everybody in his group. And they saw it attributed to his boss, the head of this logging company, wanting to get out of an unlucrative contract with the federal government, so they concocted this story.

00:18:05
iHeart Intro: It's a good way to do that.

00:18:06
Josh: Yeah, that is so seventies. You know that, that's how you would get out of a movie contract.

00:18:12
iHeart Intro: Uh, not a bad movie, though, Fire in the Guy was pretty good.

00:18:14
Josh: I never saw it.

00:18:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it's that bad. D B.

00:18:16
Josh: Sweeney, Yeah, was he on Saturday Night Live? Why do I think that?

00:18:21
iHeart Intro: Uh? You're thinking there was another swinge Julius Sweeney.

00:18:24
Josh: I know, but I thought dB sweet Sweeney was too. Maybe I'm conflating Julius Julius Sweeney and G. E. Smith and Saturday Night Live Band and coming up with dB.

00:18:36
iHeart Intro: SWEENEYH Maybe so G Smith was great?

00:18:40
Josh: Yeah? I saw G. Smith and the Sara Night Live Band backing up halland Oates at the first ever concert I ever saw.

00:18:47
iHeart Intro: Now, my friend I knew you went and saw Hall of Oates. I did not know that G. Smith was in the SNL band? Was the band?

00:18:53
Josh: Yes? And the I think it was the sect player who wore like the floor length mink coats, like the whole shebang. It was like the tick of Ala abandoned. That's who was touring with Hall.

00:19:01
iHeart Intro: And Oates, and Oates was like, can you tone it down? Can get rid of that coat?

00:19:06
Josh: It's competing with my hair and mustache.

00:19:10
iHeart Intro: All right, I think we should probably take a break. Yeah, yeah, all right, and we'll be right back and talk about more grays right after this. All right. So that was in the sixties and seventies, but basically from the fifties on through the seventies, there were all kinds of encounters and there were a lot of different kinds of aliens that people were reporting, ranging from a headless wing bat kind of thing in England to a pointy eared, glowing eyed creature in North Carolina. And this is when UFO research groups, who very much want people to believe that UFOs and aliens are real, I get the feeling behind the scenes are like, guys, we got to consolidate around to look here because all these weird aliens that people are reporting are not doing ourselves are any favors. Basically, so can we settle on the Grays and they did.

00:20:39
Josh: Yeah, and that somehow or another, that is exactly how it happened, and it ended up in mainstream pop culture being adopted like that, where Like, as the Grays became more and more widespread, it was like a positive feedback where more people portrayed aliens as the Grays because that's what aliens looked like, and it just kept spreading from there until the general streamlined understanding of what aliens looked like was the Grays over time. And I just want to point out that probably the greatest X Files episode of all time, Jose Chunks from Outer Space, turns this process on its head, where there are two gray aliens that turn out to be human actors in costumes who themselves have an actual legitimate alien encounter with an alien that looks like one of the just bizarre kind from the fifties. It's like has fur, it's a cyclops with a horn, and it has like a chicken legs, and that's like the actual alien. And I just think that's just as sharp as can be, that they took that thread and just twisted it around.

00:21:45
iHeart Intro: I don't remember that episode. I was not an X Files watcher at the time when it aired. Huh. I got into it in the uh. Although when did it stop, you know, like the early two thousands. Okay, well what I did it was syndicated while it was still going then, I guess because I started watching reruns and syndication in like ninety seven, and don't I don't even know if I kind of started at the beginning and watched it all the way through. But when I was living in New Jersey, I ended up watching a lot of X Files, so then enjoyed it quite a bit.

00:22:21
Josh: This is a standalone episode. You don't have to know anything that's going on to and joy. Yeah. Yeah, if you do know what's going on, it's even more enjoyable. But jose Chung is this science fiction author who has a book or something called from Outer Space, and he's played by Charles Nelson Riley. There's stories of the Men in Black showing up, and the Men in Black are played by Alex Trebek and Jesse the Body Ventura as themselves, but they're Men in Black. Oh yeah, it's an amazing episode. It's so great, So.

00:22:51
iHeart Intro: I definitely don't remember that one.

00:22:52
Josh: You need to go see it. It's really worth all right, it's worth your forty four minutes of your time.

00:22:58
iHeart Intro: Were you into X files from the beginning, like Live Run or whatever?

00:23:02
Josh: Pretty much?

00:23:03
iHeart Intro: Yeah?

00:23:03
Josh: Yeah when I watch it now, though I used to when originally I was like, God, get this stupid monster stuff out of let's get back to the alien right.

00:23:12
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:23:12
Josh: Now as a grown up, I'm like, that alien conspiracy thing is so played out. I really enjoy the Monster of the Week episode. Yeah more.

00:23:19
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think the mix of the two was kind of what made it so great.

00:23:22
Josh: Yeah, it was very smart, all right.

00:23:25
iHeart Intro: So the other thing we should mention about the Grays is that when Betty at one point they had her recreate a star map that the aliens who captured her had shown her, and when she described what she had seen, a lot of people said, it sounds a lot like Zeta Reticuli, which is a star system about thirty nine light years from Earth. And so you might hear them called Grays, but if you ever hear any anyone in the in the BIZ, I guess refer to the aliens as Zeta reticulans. That comes from that.

00:23:59
Josh: Yeah, Like we said, a lot of the just the basics of alien abduction stories were founded by the Hills, unaccounted for missing time, being abducted, being probed just yeah, exactly all that stuff originally with the Hills, but it formed the basis or foundation that other people that come just kind of slowly built on. And there was one person who contributed quite a bit, an artist from New York named Bud Hopkins, who said that he had a close encounter. I guess it would be the second kind where they just saw like a flying saucer over Cape cod But it was enough, it was enough of an experience that he kind of became, I don't know if obsessed as the right were, but deeply interested in the idea of UFOs and aliens. So he started kind of researching the whole thing and ended up writing a book in nineteen eighty one called I Got to Take a Deep Breath Missing Time. Colon documented stories of people kidnapp by UFOs and then returned with their memories or race.

00:25:05
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he didn't want to leave anything to chance as far as people misunderstanding what his book was about.

00:25:09
Josh: Yeah, Colan, does that make sense.

00:25:11
iHeart Intro: Right, Colan, I'm talking about aliens, baby. So that was a pretty big book and it established that pattern that we've been talking about of these abduction stories where you see the UFO and sometimes you don't remember anything and you just wake up in bed or whatever. Not accounting for the time there was a young woman in the book. It was the first time that anyone had claimed to have been abducted twice, a young woman named Virginia Horton when she was six, so I guess she was a little girl then and then at sixteen years old. And this also follows a pattern in the second one, she followed a deer into the woods and then woke up at home with a bloody nose and following an annial into the woods. As a story that pops up kind of quite a bit. You're talking about alien abduction.

00:26:05
Josh: Yes, exactly. So one of the other things that Bud Hopkins contributed was the idea that people were being repeatedly abducted. Some people were, and that he's like, probably what's going on is they're being impregnated and then you know, they give birth and then this hybrid alien human baby is born, and that's really what's going on.

00:26:28
iHeart Intro: Here, and that they take that baby daily.

00:26:30
Josh: Yeah, but I think he also suggested that this was for the benefit of the human race that this was that they were actually benevolent as brutal or I guess uncomfortable as their tactics may have seemed.

00:26:46
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. So things are really cooking at this point. Finally we get to a very very popular book. Those guy named Whitley's Streber, who was a writer already in this really helped, you know, the fact that he was already a writer and had like the backing of publishers get this book out there. But he was a horror and science fiction writer and an eighty seven published the book Communion, which had if you look up the cover of Communion, the illustration that was done by Ted Jacobs along with you know, Striber, because he was like, this is what I saw. You got to draw this that that is as stereotypical alien head as you could imagine on the cover of this very popular book.

00:27:29
Josh: Yeah, like if the Grays had kind of been percolating throughout pop culture, this is like where all that all those different threads got pulled into one alien image and then from that moment on, that's essentially what the Grays looked like that cover illustration. Because it was just such a widely read book and Streiber says and always has said, from what I can tell, he's never broken character. If this was a hoax, He's never ever even intimated that it was. He's He said that until he started realizing that he had been abducted, he had never really been much into aliens, had never done much research, so he was giving the impression that all of his accounts were fresh. He went into him fresh, like George Costanzo right, he didn't know what he was talking about when he was writing about this. This was a legitimate memory. And as he remembered more and more and more, he realized that this had been going on since childhood, and the entire chunks of his life were fabricated memories that had been implanted by the aliens that abducted him to cover up the memories of his actual abductions and what they were doing to him on their ships. And so in addition to that cover alien of the image of the Grays. One of the big things that Whitley Striver contributed to the whole I guess phenomenon is the idea of screen memories that now no longer was it just missing time. You might not be missing time, You might not even remember having been abducted, but you just knew you'd been abducted, and if you thought about it enough, or if you went and tried to get to the bottom of your repressed memories, those screen memories would fall away and the true memories of your abduction would bubble up to the surface.

00:29:16
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and it was a very, very big book. It became a movie in nineteen eighty nine, a Christopher Walkin movie. I'm pretty sure I saw it back then. I don't know if I saw it in the theater or not. It feels like a VHS movie to me, Yeah, for sure. But Walkin played him. If you look up the trailer on YouTube, it's a terrifying trailer. It's really unsettling. You should watch it. With the music and everything. They portray it as like a horror movie basically. But he is one that also Stryverer, that is, who never also claimed like officially that they were space alien. He was just like, hey, this happened to me. I'm not saying there's space aliens necessarily. He actually said they could come from another dimension, or maybe it could be something else. I know. In one of our UFO episodes, I talked about the fact that there are some people who think that the Grays are just humans from the future. Yeah, and that's what we eventually evolved to look like because our brains get bigger and bigger, so our heads bigger, and the actual outer ear is superfluous to the real hearing mechanism, So that's why they don't appear to have ears or noses. They just have ear holes and nose holes. And you know, as we go on, the eyes are supposedly getting bigger as we evolve, So that's you know, that's one theory.

00:30:42
Josh: Right or another one is that they're from another dimension, not necessarily from space. One of the other things that Striver contributed was the idea that you would be probed anally or sexually in some way, shape or form. Remember Boas the Brazilian farmer, was the one who contributed being sexually assaulted aboard a spaceship the UFO exactly, But apparently most scholars trace the anal probe trope to Whitley Striber. He said that there was a large object with a network of wires on the end that was inserted into his rectum. And what's interesting is that bears a strange resemblance to what Barney Hill claimed too. He said that he had been anally probed and that there was a needle with a network of wires or something along that line. He didn't use that exact phrase, but that it had been left out of the book by John G. Fuller, that detail had it was only it was only it only showed up in a nineteen sixty five Nightcap report, So it wasn't well known at the time. Although it's entirely possible that if Whitley Striver was a hoaxer, you can imagine as a writer, he would have done enough research to go back and read a nineteen sixty five report about the quintessential abduction experience.

00:32:03
iHeart Intro: Yeah, And as far as the anal probe goes, I've given this a lot of thought over the years, uh huh, and so like why that's always a thing, And the only thing I could come up with is that, you know, there are only so many holes. There are only so many areas of entry in your body, you know. Yeah, And there are reports of you know, nose probes and bleeding noses and stuff like that, And I think the the hidden quality, the hidden nature of the butthole might entice aliens to be like you know, there they see the nose, they see the ears, they see how the obvious ones, and then there's like ooh, there's a hidden one, right, like what treasure awaits us?

00:32:42
Josh: Yeah, that's universal, not just among humans but around the universe, Like what is in that butthole? Yeah, that's a great good stuff. I like that. Uh so, yeah, that's that's just kind of like a little like a lot of people chuck that up to Whitley Striber, which may or may not be Yeah, correct, but that is interesting. That was nineteen eighty nine that the movie community came out, what'd you say, nineteen eighty seven for the book that had a huge effect. The X Files, like we said, came along and took all this stuff. Like if you watch the X Files back then or now or whenever, all of this is just so familiar. Like Chris Carter apparently read up on the abduction phenomenon and just turned it into different plot lines, right, so yeah, pure goal. Yeah, and so that just spread it out into the pop culture even further. And then there was a guy named John Mack who was the head of Harvard's psychiatry department, who was far and away the most credentialed person to come out and say I'm pretty sure these people are telling the truth in some way, shape or form.

00:33:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, And everyone was like, sure, you want to come out with us?

00:33:52
Josh: Yeah, and he did very bravely. He was one of those people who railed against science just kind of having its own dogma, keeping its head in the sand about things that couldn't explain. He didn't like that very much, so that kind of fit with his vibe from what I can tell, But he kind of lent a little bit of legitimacy, especially if you were on the fringes. The fact that he was saying the stuff just gave you so much support. Right then.

00:34:17
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he had a book in ninety four about thirteen different abduction cases called Abduction colon Human Encounters with Alien Parentheses. Btw, I teach at Harvard.

00:34:29
Josh: Right, did I mention? Yeah? So I say we take another break and come back and talk about what scholars who don't buy the fact that these are actual alien abductions make of all this.

00:34:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it gets pretty interesting after this.

00:34:43
Josh: I think, Okay, Chuck, there's a couple of nuts and bolts things you should know about UFO subculture and it's so extensive, and it's been around for so long, and the people who are into it are so into it that just by glossing over it, we're probably gonna get stuff wrong, or we're just going to walk past some stuff. We're not experts, We've never claimed to be experts, and we're not experts of UFO subculture, So just want to caveat that. Probably should have said that at the outset of this episode. But in UFO subculture, from the research I've seen, there's a you can kind of divide people into two groups. One are contactees people who have met aliens, and the other is abductees, and those are people who have been taken by it millions. And if you'll remember back to our Project blue Book episode, there was an astronomer named Jay Allen Heinek who was a debunker of UFOs until he just became a true believer. He's the guy who came up with the close encounters classifications. Yeah, he left off with close encounters of the third kind contact. What abductees brought to that was close encounters of the fourth kind, where you were taken against your will into a spaceship. And among those two different groups there's two very different views of aliens between contact e's and abductees.

00:36:34
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, if you're a contactee, you're much more likely to relate a positive experience. Basically, I think a lot of the contactees I've read that they feel like they're like a feeling of being chosen, like in a good way. Abductees, it's kind of the other way around. There's all kinds of stories of probing, non consensual encounters, medical procedures going on. You know, all the stuff that you hear about shoving things in different holes of your body are not positive experiences for most abductees. And it's really interesting. I think that the contact ease can feel like chosen or touched. Where's the abductees feel violated?

00:37:20
Josh: It is super interesting. There's also kind of a subgroup of abductees. Those are the people who have no memory of being abducted, but they're sure that they were abducted. They probably have unaccounted time in their life that they can look back on and think like what happened there? They just get the sense that they're abducted too.

00:37:40
iHeart Intro: Right, So yeah, which is interesting.

00:37:43
Josh: It is super interesting. The thing is this is really really important. I saw this in a lot of different places with people who research UFO abductees. They say that there are definitely people who are hoaxters. Yeah, there are definitely people who have like serious mental illness and are actually delusional, but that by and large, on the whole, UFO abductees are sane, sincere, genuine people who truly believe that they were abducted by aliens and whose lives have been in a lot of cases wrecked by it because they display the symptoms of trauma. They have post traumatic stress disorder symptoms from being abducted. And so if you're like, well, you know, I don't really buy any of this as being alien in nature, Like how would you explain it? And so sociology and psychology have said about trying to explain it, neither ones really kind of rung the bell fully.

00:38:43
iHeart Intro: Yet, Yeah, for sure, there is there as plenty of research that's been done, even though they haven't you know, like you said, they haven't come to it like a great conclusion about it. But abductees their memories. The idea is like, if you're an abductee or you claim to be an abductee, then you're probably more prone to false memory, and there are some different tests they can do. One is called the Deese Rodiger McDermott task DRM, and that's where they give you a bunch of words that are sort of linked together, but there's a one word. They call it a lure word that's missing. So lyvia put together an example of snooze, blanket, snore or dream pillow bed. They don't use the word sleep in there, very key, but obviously that's the one word that's missing. And the people that are asked to sort of recount this and if they insert the missing word that there was never mentioned, like if they say sleep, then they're saying, all right, well, you're more susceptible to a false memory because we never said sleep.

00:39:54
Josh: So there, Yeah, that's exactly how they present it to yeh at the end of the study. It's very humiliating, but yeah, that's kind of one of the general premises that people who believe that they were abducted by UFOs and whose lives are really affected by it negatively just are more susceptible to generating false memories, and some research backs that up. There have been studies that show that they do report more critical lower words than other people. Who don't believe they were abducted. Other studies say, we tried the same thing and found no difference whatsoever between the two, but we did find differences in other psychological traits like disassociativity, like having like reality seems unreal to you, absorption, which is a predisposition to get deeply immersed in sensory or mystical experiences, the likelier to have paranormal beliefs, likelier to believe that they have psychic abilities, fantasy proneness, difficulty differentiating between fantasy and reality, and a tendency to hallucinate. And that so these people are like, no, it's not a proneeness to developing false memories. It's all these other traits that are basically they're luring these people into this kind of fantasy world that they're not distinguishing from reality, and that that essentially has become part of their life to them, they've adopted that as part of their life. Those seem to be the two dominant rival psychological explanations for this.

00:41:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and there's another sort of not sort of it sounds incredibly cruel. Test that was done, or a study rather when they got kids together either seven or eight year olds or eleven and twelve year olds, and they said, you were abducted by an alien when you were four years old. In fact, here's your mom and she's gonna reinforce this by telling you this happened. And here's a fake newspaper. Well they don't say fake, but here's a newspaper report that talks about these abductions being you know, pretty calm, and it's totally made up, of course. And then if these children go on to describe a lot more detail about the memory of being abducted when they were four years old, then their classified as having false memories. And I just I can't believe that they were allowed to get away with doing it.

00:42:17
Josh: Yeah, from what this one, I think a British Psychological Association or society article found that they could find two studies that tried to implant false subduction memories into kids. One was from nineteen eighty four and they actually ascribed abductions to basically suppressed or repressed memories of being born. And then this one from two thousand and nine with Oatgar and friends, right, and like, yeah, it's deeply unethical, and they debriefed the kids. They said, no, this is all just a study or whatever, so you don't walk around thinking like this actually really happened to you, but who knows if that really worked. But it raised a really important point, really as unethical as it was, showed how easy it is for false memories to be implanted, especially if you are being told that by someone in a position and of authority like your psychologists or therapists or psychiatrist. Right. Yeah, And there's a really big rift in the field of psychology and psychiatry between whether you whether traumatic memories can be repressed, and if so, that means they can probably be recovered through good therapy, or if you don't actually repress traumatic experiences, and that if you do try to recover memories, what you remember is going to be false memories that are accidentally implanted. So that whole premise that you have missing time, and that if you go see a therapist who's sympathetic and understands what you're going through, they will help you recover those memories. It strongly suggests that all those are our false memories, even though again they're causing real legitimate pain in these people's lives.

00:44:01
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And I know we talked about this and maybe Project Bluebrik Book, but some others as far as what else this could be why you're having these false memories, and sleep paralysis always seems to come up. We did an episode on this. About fifteen percent of the population experiences it. It's when you wake up in the middle of the night. You can't move, You might hear some buzzing sounds, you might see flashing lights. You almost always, it seems like, see pretty frightening shadowy figures in your room, maybe hovering above you or at the foot of your bed. So sleep paralysis could explain some of this, or theoretically it could. And then another one which is interesting as far as the hypothesis goes, is magnetic disturbances by plate tectonics that are causing hallucinations. And this is what's really interesting to me, distorted recollections of meta procedures while you're under anesthesia, like as you're going out. I think anyone who's ever done the twilight sleep thing for some you know or major you know surgery, When you're fully under that six or seven seconds where you're laying there with the bright light above you and people hovering over you, it gets weirder and weirder, and people think that this could be associated with that because a lot of the people who had reported abductions had undergone surgery recently.

00:45:32
Josh: Yeah, that's pretty pretty interesting as far as coincidences go. That's anesthesia awareness, and I think I think we did a whole episode on it. The idea that you can have memories if you're not under quite enough, and that if it's a medical procedure, yeah, you could remember that as aliens, you know, probing you or whatever.

00:45:52
iHeart Intro: Sure, Yeah, that's what it feels like.

00:45:54
Josh: Yeah, well guess so for sure, I just remember being like, man, I'm so wasted, reminding myself like, oh yeah, I'm allowed to be These people got me wasted, right. Sociology, for their part, has done some study too, and just kind of quickly what they've come up with is that if you are very religious, you're probably less likely to believe in aliens and even less likely to believe you were abducted by aliens. But if you are untrusting of the government, you're far likelier to no surprise, yeah, to believe that you were abducted by aliens.

00:46:32
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And also the fact that who is it Joseph O. Baker's a sociologist who studies this stuff a lot, and he's like, post Watergate, you saw a lot of this stuff happening, and that's you know, when a lot of people have had big distrust of the government. So it sort of there's a correlation there at least for sure.

00:46:51
Josh: And then I say we wrap it up on that study by Bud Hopkins, the artists who've gotten real deep into.

00:46:58
iHeart Intro: Abduction lore, Yeah, let's do.

00:47:01
Josh: It, Okay. So in the nineties Bud Hopkins worked with some academics and came up with like a legitimate random survey that sought to see how many of the population, like what percentage of the population believes they were abducted, And they came up with a like five like a questionnaire that got to the bottom of whether somebody felt like they had experienced five different aspects of abduction, right waking up paralyzed, with a sense of strange presence in the room, losing an hour or more of time that lost an accounted for a time. Feeling of flying could also correlate with witchcraft. Seeing strange lights in a room and then finding odd scars on your body and being like I have no idea where the scar came from.

00:47:44
iHeart Intro: Yeah, So they did that this in the early nineteen nineties. They did some they know, controlled the data or did some controlling for the data, and they found that two percent of the sample had four of those five related experien variance has happen to them, which is about three point seven million Americans. That number, I think at UFO ologists and you know, people who study this stuff say, now, you know that number is really really high. It's probably more like thousands, but three point seven million people experience at least for of those five things.

00:48:20
Josh: Yeah, a lot of people. So a lot of people use that in like articles and stuff on that, like, three point seven million is a big number. But yeah, I just want to point out they they had a really ingenious way of separating out the fibers from the outset. One of the questions was, you know, does the word trondant mean have special meaning for you? And about one percent of respondents said, yep, that really does you know what I'm talking about? And Trondon is a made up word that they used to catch fibers. And I think Trondon is like a really great band name too, especially because of the background it.

00:48:56
iHeart Intro: Has Yeah, Space Rocket, good one.

00:49:00
Josh: You got anything else? Yeah, Yeah, I mean, the whole thing's still ongoing. There's plenty of people out there who believe they were abducted, and psychology is still struggling to get to the bottom of it fully, So hopefully it will, so it can help all those people whose lives are affected by it negatively.

00:49:16
iHeart Intro: Yeah, And at the very least we've gotten some fun movie and TVs out of.

00:49:19
Josh: There for sure. If you want to know more about alien abductions, there's a lot to read out there, and you can do that. And in the meantime, we're just going to go ahead and have a listener mail.

00:49:31
iHeart Intro: Hey, guys, been listening since twenty thirteen. Since then, you've been with me through college graduation, brain surgery, a wedding, COVID at, my teaching career, IVYF and.

00:49:41
Josh: Our new baby Wowee.

00:49:44
iHeart Intro: Since Amber was born in last July, and catching up on missed episodes. In August twenty twenty three, I think you had a couple of EPs about language acquisition. This is so in my wheelhouse because I'm a middle high school Spanish teacher and it maybe think of this anecdote relating to language act posician frequently pepper Spanish into my daily vocabulary. And I also hate squirrels. This is right up your alley, Josh. I frequently refer to them in Spanish. One day last summer, I asked my husband, who is a gringo, what he thought the Spanish word for squirrel was. He hesitated and then guessed, bendejo. I'll let you look up at that word actually means, but it's definitely not squirrel. After listening to the Para Social Relationship episode, I got too embarrassed to tell you this anecdote anecdote right away after the language episodes, but I decided to send it anyway now. Currently listening to the twenty twenty three Halloween special and hope to be caught up by June. And that is from Becky Hill.

00:50:43
Josh: Thanks a lot, Becky, and congratulations to you and your husband on the birth of Amber. And from what I know about bendejo, like that's a pretty accurate.

00:50:52
iHeart Intro: Term for squirrel.

00:50:54
Josh: Yeah. Okay, if you want to be like Becky and get in touch with us and just share some great stuff about your life, we love to hear that.
