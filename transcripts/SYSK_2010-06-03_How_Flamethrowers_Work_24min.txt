Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff You Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant that makes this Stuff you Should Know, right, Chuck, Yeah, yeah, Jerry just I love it when like we get last second instructions. Yeah, and they don't make any sense. Just save it for the show, guys, right, or show that picture on the podcast the audio podcast. Oh goodness, how are you sir? I'm fine by all rights Friday, but it's actually Thursday, but it's almost Memorial Day. Yeah, and we're not Are you coming in tomorrow at all? No, I'm not comfortable saying either way. Well, it's all to be surprised. I don't want to get in trouble. Well I'm not. I'm still scared of the man. I know you're not. But you're all like, hey, look at me. I'm forty. I make my own decisions, not forty, So Chuck. You're George Carlin fan right, Yeah, the late George Carlin. Just the late alright. We always had the bummer, don't you. The late George Carlin could be like George Carlin. He's the greatest stand up comedian ever, the very the worm food George Carlin, Yeah, the dearly departed. Yes, I like him. I have an obscure stand up bit that I'll bet you haven't heard of that is the appropub of our topic today. So George Carlin um had a bit about flamethrowers. I never heard that one. He said that the very presence of flamethrowers, and I'm paraphrasing, the very presence of flamethrowers means that at some point sometime someone said to himself, you know, there's a bunch of people over there that I'd like to set on fire, but they're too far away from me to get the job done. I wish there was something that I could use to throw flames on them, And as a result, we now have the flamethrower, which is kind of crazy when you think about it that way. It is pretty interesting, it is, And when you start to really look into flamethrowers, you realize just how horrific the acts that humans inflict on other humans can be. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty awful stuff. Actually, Yeah, when you, I mean, actually all kinds of modern weapon. Rhenno. My brother in lawson the Marines, he told me about this. I think it's called a flachette, some sort of bomb that like explodes above people and sends thousands of like razor blades shooting out what. I think it's mainly used for clearing like jungle, but ya, jungle of enemy combatant exactly. To some sick I thought that up, we're like, what one step away from the alien weapons in District nine where people just blow up in an almost cartoonish fashion. Yeah, it's coming the atomizer or something they'll call it. Um. What's what's odd is that that person, that first person that George carlin Um envisions, actually lived a lot longer ago than you would think. I was shocked. I was well century BC, fifth century b C. Man right, it wasn't well, it was a flamethrower. It was very crude, vulgar, if you will, flamethrower. It was a long tube sort of like a blowgun, and they filled it with solid stuff like hot coal and sulfur and went, yeah, ideally you don't suck in. That would be bad. No. I was thinking that too, like you have to suck in the breath before you put the tube. Deer mouth or us, you're in big trouble. Oh that's the case with any blow blowgun, right, Sure, did you ever make those in your kid? No? I never did. That was too busy burning stuff. You could have done both apparently. So Yeah, they would shoot I guess um hot coal or sulfur out at their enemy combatant instead of a flame per se, which I guess ultimately it would bounce off of their arm and they'd be like, ah, that burns, and then they just tussle and leg wrestling, right, and shake hands afterwards and go eat a bore. That's that's how that went to Life CENTRYBC with Josh. But leave it to the Greeks, who were one of the brainiest, most um thieving cultures of all time. They probably got this idea from the Chemites. Frankly, but there's this stuff called um Greek fire, right, And actually I can't say that the Greeks came up with it. It's called Greek fire, but the Byzantines that what we know is turks um. We're uh, we're most notorious for using this stuff. Yeah, and that they think they're not sure because it was a long time ago. It was a mixture of liquid petrol and sulfur and like stuff like quicklime petrol British for gas. Yeah, and UM. They would pump it out actually from a reservoir through little narrow tubes and like anything that goes from a big reservoir type system to a small, thin one, it would create pressure to shoot it out and then some unlucky guy would be the lighter at the end of it, and that would be like a real flamethrower, like dozens of feet. Yeah, as we're gonna learn, anybody whose job it was to deal with any aspect of flame throwing UM was the unlucky guy. It's one of the more dangerous weapons you can use, UM, but it was very effective. Number one, since it's oil based, Uh, it could this this Greek fire could be used in naval battles because it would still burn even when it contacted the water. UM. And so the Byzantines mounted it on their ships. These flamethrowers UM on their ships and on the city walls around Constantinople and basically just repelled people out of fear as much as you know, burning them alive. Yeah, they were. Their enemies were really freaked out. I imagine when they first saw like fire shooting at them. Yes, freaked out and intrigue, especially in the case of the Chinese. See what the Byzantines had was a single action pump. You just did the foot pump with literally do you see that? Jerry them following your command, um. The the Byzantines had a single action bellows pump to where when you press down on the down stroke, it would push the liquid out. Right. Yes, you get like a burst of fire. And that's it right because on the upstroke nothing was happening except with the bellows were filling back up with air to press down compressed right. Um. The Chinese said, hey, that's that's really funny because we have a double action bellows to where you are compressing air um on the up stroke and the downstroke. So instead of your stupid little short bursts of Greek fire, we have one long burst that just cuts you in half. Lead to the Chinese get better the wheelbarrow, the kite, the hang glider, the flamethrower, gun pouter, and actually gunpowder um equaled the demise of flamethrowers for about a thousand years, right, Yeah, as soon as gunpowder came along, they were like, yeah, we're just chumps with fire. When we can actually shoot a gun, that's that's the way of the future. And it was. But so is the flamethrower as it turns out. Yeah, because it lay dormant for about a thousand years. And then in World War One, actually right before World War One, the Germans, a very warlike state at the time, were, um, they said, you know what, exactly can we and our arsenal that is just totally scary and wildly destructive. Yes, let's look back through the annals of of you know, historic weaponry and find something. And they look through and they said the flamethrower. Yeah. Richard Fielder is an engineer in nineteen o one. They credit him with inventing it, but he clearly was using old technology as the initial idea. At least. It's a clever design, though, isn't it. Yeah, because this from this original design. Um, there have been you know, some polishing moments for the flamethrower over the years, but from that, from that modern era that the design has remained relatively the same. Right, It's like a three tank design. Yeah, the flamin furfur because what it's called nice the Germans. That's what the German uh, and it was, um, well let's yeah, let's go ahead and explain how it works with thanks, all right. And this is the handheld flamethrower, which is the one that's I guess was most readily used in combat. Yeah, and it's the one you see like a guy's wearing these tanks on his back and he's got the rifle. It's just right. So you got two outer tanks and those are filled with the flammable fuel oil based petrol if you will, like Greek fire and um. Then there's a center, smaller tank which holds a compressed gas like butane and uh it was. It would feed the gas through a pressure right you later connected to the tubes and you can take it from here. Well, the this is why I think it's very clever. The bututane served a dual purpose. One that was compressed, so when you open the valve, it would push the liquid fuel out of the tanks into the tube and ultimately in the reservoir and the gun. The pressure regulator, right, that's what they would but switch on. There is another tube that came directly out of the third tank that held the compressed the gas like butuane, and this tube went directly to the ignition valve right right, so it served as the igniter later on. Right that it was because it was the bututane that was actually burning when you um. When you open the ignition valve, the bu tane flows to the end. This is with air the end of the rifle. UM and then there's like there's two triggers. There's the fuel released trigger, right, and then there's the ignition trigger. And the ignition trigger is basically you're operating a battery that operates a spark plug, sends a current, generates heat right nights the tane. Now you have that little blue flame on the end. Yeah, that's what you've seen in movies, like if you see them around. Yeah, exactly, you see the little like three inch flame coming out in the end, right, that's actually beautane burning. The fuel hasn't been released, the hell fire has not been opened yet or released yet. That's when you squeeze what's the fuel released trigger and then well, yeah, then that pulls back a little valve plug because you obviously want it plugged or else you're gonna have a big mess on your hands. You'll be on fire very quickly. So when you pull the fuel release trigger, it pulls the little valve plug back and then all the fuel supply suddenly rushes through to the tip of the gun where the flame is and boom, there you go. Yeah and um. In nineteen forty two, the Army Chemical Warfare Service, I think is what it was called. Um, they came up with a little something called napalm, which is ultimately a g asoline or petrol in the case of Chuck and our British friends, UM, a gasoline thickening agent. So with a slightly thickened gas you have a longer range, It carries further because it has more mass or girth or whatever. There's less there's less friction from the ground coming up right. Um and uh. It also can be concentrated more easily. Right right. So basically that was one of those real big polishing moments. It went from just gas which sprays, to thick gas which sticks and burns. It evaporates much less quickly, so it will burn forever and it's really difficult to put out, and if you get covered in it, you're entirely in trouble. Yes, you're out of luck. And they would mount these on well p t boats. For one, have you ever seen the videos of those things, like cruising down the river, shooting in napalm into the forest. Well, I see there's a picture of it in the article. I've never seen video of It's pretty wicked. Yeah, And they called them, they called them zippo flamethrowers, right, because the ignition um system failed so frequently. It's just like on a gas grill, they have to with a zippo d And that's the other unlucky dude. I guess he'd be like, don't get too close to it in his hand, right, And so flamethrowers, it wasn't just some guy you know where. It would be like a bunch of infantry guys and then some guy on the end happened to grab the flamethrower that morning when they went out, and it's just you know, they were part of a tactical strategy. Yeah. What would happened was rifleman would lay down cover fire. Let's say you come to the mouth of a cave and there's a bunch of enemy combatants in there, and they're shooting you and they have snipers and you're in big trouble. All your your rifleman lay down fire on this case, so those guys can't move. Cover fire right to allow your flamethrower man to get close. He was highly susceptible at this point because of what he's wearing on his back. Yes, all it takes is one good shot to one of those tanks and that guy's gone, or a bad shot, just a shot, yeah, if you come in contact with it with the bullet. Yes, um. But so the flamethrower guy gets close basically cooks everybody, burns everyone to death in that cave, right, that's his job. And then after that the munitions guys come in and explode the cave so it can never be used again. And that's sinora for cave dwellers. Yes. Uh, you know, speaking of a quick death, I've always heard when I was a kid, you know that. You know, if you were a flamethrower in war, your average lifespan is like thirty seconds in combat. Well, I always heard that, and I'd scoured the internets and I could not find anything to verify that, but um, that's what I always heard. I thought that was an interesting tidbit. I did read that most people who were flamethrower operators didn't survive. I would imagine it's pretty dangerous thing to be toting around. Yeah, and they also had assistant because the assistance would open and close the valves on the pack form. That was the whole job. It was always a two man team, so both of them would usually not make it. I would if I was the assistant, I would turn on his little valve and then run for cover and then run up and turn it off again. Right, And I'd probably pretty unpopular with the flamethrower guy probably, And then the flamethrower guy was well liked because if you can take out an entire gun nest of people, then you know everybody's going to applaud you and clap, and you know, probably not get too close though, because you're going to die eventually. Yeah, I'd rather be a sniper. I think that'd be like I played Call of Duty. I got a p S three now that I tell you that. No, it was given to me by my step step step dad, now father in law. You did tell me my stepfather in law, And so I got just a couple of games. I'm not like a huge gamer at all, Like I think a nintendol, like the first Nintendo was the last thing I actually owned. But um, I play Call of Duty now. I like a shooter games too. It's pretty fun. But you choose to be a sniper on that. Well, now there are just certain levels where you can be a sniper. Like you'll pick up a sniper gun if you want. And I always usually kind of just hang back and pick guys off, especially guys with flamethrowers. So here we go again to liberal peace nicks like us when it comes to like this war stuff, we just get all giddy. Well it is this one. For some reason, I was reading a passage about a flamethrower operator in World War Two who you know, um received the Medal of Honor for um invading a Japanese they think they're called pillbox. It was a little gun nest and burning them all and burning them all alive, and like the the guy wrote um that there were some muffled screams and then silence. It's like, you know, being burned alive. It's pretty much everybody's worst death, I would think. So it's up there. Well, we had worst way to die. That's right up there, and I think if I remember correctly, burning to death is consistently the number one, unlike informal polls. Right, imagine is pretty painful and it happened a lot in World War One to vietn M. Yeah, I imagined area. This is a horrible weapon. But you can find uh, civilian applications for can't you. Yeah. Well, before we move on to that, we also need to say that they were on tanks as well, so it wasn't just boats. They used them on tanks, and uh, the design was basically the same. You just had a lot more fuel and you had like piston rotary pumps to get a lot more length on your shot girth. And yeah, the backpack mounted ones had a range of about fifty yards, right, That's that's a long way though. Yeah, let's have a football field. You don't have to get that close. Sure. Yeah, I wonder if the first enemy that was like, he's got a flamethrower, but we're way too far away. They were within exactly. Uh yeah, civilian applications um, forced forced fire fighters forest firefighters? Is that how you say it? I don't know they actually use these when they do like the prescribed burning, like sometimes they'll burn well not just the firefighters, they do prescribe burns anyway. And then sometimes the firefighters do that, they'll like burn a section to cut it off right there. And that's what they do it with flamethrowers, which actually kind of made me want to go get a job with the forestry Service. She could burn things on purpose. Well, yeah, did you hear about this car thing in South Africa? Theft deterrent system that burned you know? Yeah, I don't think it's still around. This is like twelve years ago, and um, a South African man invented it was called the blaster and basically it would shoot a man high fireball that's what they called it. What at you if you tried to break into the car for a mere ran which is uh and this that was like six or fifty bucks, and um, it would squirt liquefied gas from a bottle in the trunk through two nozzles located on the front door. And the rub is you couldn't turn one on and turn one off, so if a guy was breaking into like the driver's side door, it would still shoot fire out as a passenger side to whomever might be walking by unluckily on that. So let's say, yeah, that's that's an invention that wasn't fully thought through. I would think so. But apparently he sold a bunch of him at the time and he said it's non lethal, but it would definitely blind a person, is what he said, and keep them from stealing your car. Yeah, because they can't see cars any longer. That's terrible. Yeah, way to go South Africa. Um. Lastly, Chuck. Fire breathers their form of They follow the basic principles of flamethrowing by drinking kerostene. There you go. If you want to learn about fire breathers, we have an article on them. If you want to learn more about flame throwers. And before you send us a listener mail, we are aware of flamethrower exhaust systems. We've both seen Greece before. Um, you can type any word you want to into the handy search bar how stuff works dot Com. It'll yield something interesting. I guarantee you that. Uh So, Chuck listening not quite okay, Well, we got to do our quick plugs. We're gonna do a little quicker this time though, because we take like ten minutes to do our New York plugs and everything New York. We're gonna be at the Knitting Factory in Brooklyn on June seven from five thirty to seven thirty. We're having a happy hour for stuf of you should know fans. Come with your elbows prepared to be rubbed. Stay Wednesday, June ninth for a trivia night to be determined not t b D my friend. We have a location at a time and is at the Bell House in Brooklyn, New York, and show up at about six thirty and trivia will start at seven. And this one is eighteen and older eighteen to get in twenty one to drink and uh. If you're showing up alone, that's fine to just join up with some people when you're there and form a team and make some new friends. Come to one or both yes, uh. And then lastly co ED and Kiva Man, Yeah, Coed Cooperative for Education who we went to Guatemala with. If you like their bag, which is a pretty cool bag, you can donate and easily five bucks with your little cell phone there. Uh, text the words stuff STUF to two zero to two two and um texting data rates may apply and it's gonna be added a little five dollar donations gonna added to your bill. Right when you text stuff, you'll get a reply text saying are you sure, and you just text back yes, and there you go. Five bucks to help out UM Guatemalan kids learn to read and Kiva Kiva, Kiva, Kiva. We haven't thrown much love to our Kiva team lately, but we should because you know, as everyone knows, we hit the hundred thousand dollar mark right, I like nothing in March, I believe March nineteenth, UM and since then, our moderators on our Kiva team, Glenn and Sonja Um threw down the gauntlet pretty much immediately and said, let's get to a quarter of a million dollars. Yeah, man, that'd I'm awesome. We are on track right now, by Glenn and Sonya's estimate, uh to hit the two thousand dollar mark around August. Well, actually, we want to hit a quarter of a million dollars around August. Is that the deal? Yeah, so we need to step it up a little bit. If you want to join the stuff you should know Kiva dot org team, you can go to www dot kiva dot org slash team Slash Stuff you should know and sign up and get a warm feeling in your heart when you donate. And remember this is micro lending, so the money actually comes back to it's repaid. Yeah, and if if you have a cold heart, you can actually even pull your money back out and get it back if you want. But it's more fun to read loan it totally. It really is, all right, So there you have it. Alright, So listener, mail my friend I'm gonna call this I love this dude. And his name is Guy and not as in hey guy, his real name is Guy. I got Guy from San Francisco, says, guys, just listen to the Art Theft podcast. And by the way, we do know about the Paris heist that just went down. Pretty cool, uh, very intriguing for future monetarians. And of neither here nor there. However, I have a little bit a little habit that I thought I might like to share that loosely pertains I have never stolen art knowingly. However, I do frequently and I'm subjected to I travel frequently, and I'm subjected to much distasteful art guilty of being a budget traveler. So there's the rub. But to amuse myself, I like to take the horrible art off the wall, take it out of the glass and frame, and add the ever so slightest detail. This guy is wonderful. He does this in Adele's a chicken in the corner by the barn, a seagull flying over the crest of a wave, a beer bottle and fishing pole by the babbling brook. I do it in every hotel, motel, hotel, hostel, bungalow, you name it. I will stay there and I will change into the art. They have art and hostels now, yeah, probably not. It makes me chuckle to think that maybe one day someone will be staring at an awful hotel painting and look closely and notice one of the gallant cowboys has a tin of skull by his left boot heel. So if you stay in cheap hotels, keep your eyes out people you may have stayed where a guy from San Francisco has stayed. Just don't turn on the black line. That's all I have to say. That's awesome. That is awesome. Man. I love to hear people doing cool stuff. Vandalism, Yeah, but it's it's vandalism with like an eye towards it's fundalism.
