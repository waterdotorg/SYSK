Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here too, in spirit, and that makes this Stuff you Should Know Chuck's Favorite Food edition. Yeah, my favorite food this is I don't blame you, Chuck, like I love fried chicken, but I love it even more after researching this, I've just got this whole must have attitude. And I think that that brings up an important point that we should lead with, which is, if you are vegan, you should probably skip this episode because you're not going to be vegan by the end of it. I'll tell you that much. Yeah. You know, people ask the favorite food question. You get that a lot in your life, and I guess I sort of went back and forth over the years with different things. But it's fried chicken. It is fried chicken. Okay, Well, then are you are I'm guessing something of an expert for Atlanta fried chicken, best fried chicken in Atlanta. Oh man, Sorry to put you on the spot. Do you want to come back to it at the end of the episode. Well, no, I was afraid you would ask me, what, like, what my favorite of all time? Was there something? Um, that's really hard because because there's so many kind of small variations, and I love fried chicken so much. I love so many different kinds that I don't know that I could say that I've ever had it, like put down my fork and me like, are my fingers really and said, this is hands down, like the best fried chicken I've ever had. I've said this is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had a lot, but I will say this, and it is a little controversial if you live in the South to take a grocery store allegiance like this. But Publix is known for their fried chicken. I don't like it. I like I like Croger's fried chicken better, much better. I've never had Kroger's fried chicken. But I don't like public Is fried chicken either. It's not good. It's too bready for me. And I don't know if it's my local Publics, but it always tastes like it's like the oil is old acrid. Yeah, man, it's just doesn't do it. I love Kroger's fried chicken. I'm a big fan of minimal breading. Let that chicken skin shine and uh, sort of a dry fry is more my my jam. I have had the experience of putting my fork down, actually my fingers down and saying like that was the best fried chicken I've ever had. It was, um remember that that restaurant indicator Watershed. Oh sure. So the head chef was Scott Peacock and he and his mentor Edna Lewis came up with this fried chicken recipe that they used to serve it at Watershed. It was I mean, I've never had anything even approaching it, and I've had really good fried chicken too, I would say second probably Colonnade over on chester Bridge really good, but this was it was just an entirely different level. And you can find the recipe online really easily, and it's pretty, it's pretty hashtag basic, but something about it all comes together and makes it just just astoundingly good. It's so good. Yeah, it's just so good, Chuck. I think Emily Sailors from Indigo Girls was co owner or owner of Watershed for a while, may still be. I don't know, No, she sold it, okay, I think yeah, And they moved and Scott Peacock moved on and everything it was it was like the Beatles for a second. I am also going to carry out this and shout out my grandmother Bryant Opeal. Bryant's fright chicken was really my favorite. I haven't had it, you know. She died at the age of a hundred and one, uh, about eight years ago, but she hadn't been cooking for a while either, So it's been since I was probably in my twenties since I had opals uh, and hers was And I'm a big fan of this preparation, not deep fried or pressure fried, but skillet fried, which is when you have a cast iron skillet and you're you know, you're flipping the chicken. You're letting it fry and flipping the chicken because it's not completely covered in oil. And she also used just whatever grease was in the big jar on her stovetop. She would just throw all the grease in there from everything she ever cooked, and it would harden or you know, uh, congeal into this lardie jar of goodness. So she would just kind of just slop whatever that was. Um, so it's probably some bacon grease in there, not probably most definitely country ham stuff. That was all kinds of of meaty congealed fat in there. Yeah it sounds good. Her stuff was so good. So um. Yeah, So we're talking fried chicken. We could just keep doing this if you want. I know, we should start food show maybe when we eventually retire. If we start a food show, we're naming it Opal Bryant's Fried Chicken, Okay, okay, or if we ever open a restaurant, that will be the name. So yeah, we'll do a food show sometime sometime. This will be one of those things where we can be like and our fried chicken episode that we did years back was really good too. This is gonna be like that kind of episode. So we're talking fried chicken, and it's one of those things where everyone associates the dish with the American South, and for good reason, that's kind of where it it caught its um. It was established in the way that we understand it today, which is from what I can tell bone in chicken pieces, breaded and fried in oil, and that is fried chicken. That's American Southern American fried chicken. That's what purists will tell you. Anything different is is not technically fried chicken. But the American South is kind of where it got its start, but it dates back even further further than that, and even weirder, it seems like it might have come from a specific place in Europe originally too. Yeah, Scotland, if you can believe that there are appearances, I mean, people would be being people have been eating chickens for a long time. Uh. You can find recipes in books from the eighteenth century for fried chicken. Uh. Those one in seventeen thirty six. There was one in seventeen forty seven where it's you know, clearly dipped in flour, fried in some kind of lard. But it seemed like the Scots are the ones who started frying it. And I looked up this up in a lot of places and kind of saw the same thing. Uh. You know, the Brits didn't really care that much about eating things that tasted good, so they would boil or bake their chicken. That baked chicken could be good, but boiled chicken can never be good. Uh. And the Scots said, no, we'll flay it, and so they started frying it up in lard. And we're really onto something, as it turned out. Yeah, And the reason why at least one food is Storian is. This is their theory. But the reason why it kind of has legs is that a lot of the Scots and Scott's Irish um colonists who came to the United States, um, they owned slaves, enslaved people, and they think that the Scots taught their slaves to cook this for them, and that's where the origination of um black American Southerners having this um like being the kind of the place where fried chicken originated. That's where they think that it probably came from Scotland. Yeah, And I mean, I think what we can say for sure is that's where it was perfected. Were these enslaved women, Uh they spiced it in such a way because Scotland and in the UK, like, they're not known for their for their they're doing much better now, but they weren't known for the most flavorful um spiced food. So it was even though they were frying chicken, it was it was known as a little more bland until they got to the American South and these women started spicing it right, and that's where it became this this really really scrumptious and delicious food that we know today brought over from Scotland, but perfected in the American South. Yeah, I think the theory, the other theory that was, you know, long held is that it was brought over by um West African slaves to America. Um, but I think people have done investigations around West Africa and there isn't a fried chicken dish that. Um. They would fry their chicken lightly over there, but then they would braise it for the rest of the time. And I think the Brits would do that too. Um, you know, it isn't the same, so they actually do think it kind of came from Scotland, but yes, perfected by um enslaved cook women in the American South. And there's mentions of it too, I think, dating back to the seventeenth cent so it is an all American dish for sure. Yeah, it was. Um, it was a dish that was a little more of a treat at the time, at least preceding the Civil War. Uh. It was very labor intensive to get these chickens and to pluck the chickens and prepare them and cut them up. And it wasn't like just like throwing a whole plucked chicken into a pot kind of thing. Uh. There was no air conditioning obviously, so like you know, laboring over a hot stove all day in hot grease. It was just a lot to undertake. So it was a little more of a of a fancy meal to have, um, like on the fourth of July maybe or a big like birthday celebration. And even though uh, these women, these enslaved women were perfecting this dish, Uh, they their family wasn't really allowed to eat it that much until they were able to raise their own chickens. Um. There were laws or I don't know about laws per se, but um and slay people weren't allowed to own cattle. They weren't allowed to own pigs, but chickens were sort of seen as not very significant enough to restrict at the time. So they let enslave people you know, own and raise chickens. Uh, some of which they would actually at the plantation buy from them to eat. Yeah. I think Monicello bought um their chickens from their enslaved people working there. Yeah, I think you're right. So, um, there was a up shot, or there was an upside of the black women that were cooking this under duress at the time, who learned to perfect this dish. Was that after um emancipation, when the Jim Crow South started, they were a lot of them were able to support themselves by selling fried chicken because they were the only ones who knew how to make it correctly. And so there were there There was a UM, a woman, American studies scholar named Psyche Williams Forsen, who wrote a book basically so this chicken made this house or this house was made by chicken. Yeah, was called Building Houses out of Chicken Legs. Col Black Women, Food and Power. Uh. And I do want to shout her out too, because she has a new book out this year that looks great. It seems like she really explores um sort of the diaspora and how that affected foods that Black people ended up eating sort of around the world, especially in America. Uh. And there's a new one called Eating While Black, Food, Shaming and Race in America that just came out this year. And I saw a couple of interviews whetherr She's just it's amazing stuff that she's writing right on. So one of the things UM that she explored where these um women called waiter carriers who would show up along the tracks at railroad stops, um, you know, and this was a time like when railroads had really just kind of started up, and you couldn't really get food anywhere on these cars. Dining cars hadn't been invented yet. So these um, the these black women who were called waiter carriers would show up with pies or coffee or fresh picked berries or fried chicken and would sell them like hand them to the customers on the train through the windows. I think they sold chicken breasts for like twenty five cents apiece and other like like drumsticks and thighs for I think five cents apiece something like that. And there's a specific town called Gordonsville, Virginia, which became known as the chicken fried chicken capital of the world. And apparently some people would go out of their way to stop in Gordonsville, Virginia on their train journey so that they could buy the fried chicken there. Yeah, it was. It was a regional hub in Gordonsville at the time. And they still have a pretty robust fried chicken festival, I think in October. I think we missed it this year, but I saw them refer to themselves as the chicken leg Center of the Universe, which is another fun name. But we should also point out while this great sort of entrepreneurial spirit was being weren't after emancipation, a lot of these women were also harassed and robbed and things like that. So you know, they were they were doing the best they could to make a living, but it's still wasn't as above board as it should have been. Of course, got so um they were eventually, um, I guess outlawed by proxy after America started developing like food safety laws. They're like, you can't do that anymore. We're gonna start regulating vendors. And then also dining cars came along and that really kind of did that. That was the death and all of it. Forget this amazing fried chicken being handed to you through a window for a quarter. Come et in the dining car. We're featuring British boiled checking for dinner tonight. It's probably right. So, um, you said something about how these women were robbed and exploited, and you know, there's a there's a through line through a lot of American history where um, a lot of black culture um gets kind of taken over by white culture, and that the transfer is lost to history or erased or blurred, or people just ignore it. So fried chicken is actually one of those um things. Because if you ask, like a lot of Americans on the street who invented fried chicken, I would guess a significant portion of them are going to identify Colonel Sanders as the person who did. And he definitely did not. He wasn't even the first fried chicken restaurant tour, but he was part of a tradition where while he wasn't stealing directly from the labor the intellectual proper you could say, of um, black women. Um, he definitely benefited from it big time. There were people who were just directly exploiting it. And there was a restaurant chain in Salt Lake City that was open in ve chuck. Yeah, this is one of you know, sort of the shameful parts of our racism in America. This is in the nineteen twenties. Uh, And it was you know, it was just a time when you had like straight up racist iconography on mainstream restaurant chains. Uh. And that was the case with the coon Chicken in had racist character caricatures on the logo. And it was in birth of a nation. You know, it was like if it makes an appearance in Birth of a Nation, that's like the ultimate stamp of racism, of this sort of stereotype of what this you know, this great food that was invented by these enslaved people was then turned on them and used against them as sort of a stereotype of of whatever they wanted to say what they thought black people were at the time, right, which was basically the goal was to debase and demean black people so that they wouldn't enjoy full citizenship, either politically, legally or culturally. And it was we talked about it in our Watermelon episode because I mean, like everybody loved watermelons and everybody loved fried chicken, but the way that the white society would point to it to kind of degrade black society was, well, we all love it, but Black people really love it. They're really crazy for watermelon, they're really crazy for fried chicken. They'll do anything for it. And it just had this kind of um, this this this purpose in this goal and successfully of of demeaning, they making them seem less of that even stuff that everybody enjoyed, they enjoyed it differently. They were different. They were less somehow, and you know that was apparently the fried chicken thing in particular was was first sourced in Birth of a Nation. Alright, so let's take a break and uh, let's talk about some of the more fun parts of fried chicken. How about that? Okay? And things stuck? Stuck. I don't know that you know it stuck. And it's a great name. That's the name of It's great with an X. Alright, so fried chicken. Well, let's talk about chicken in general. Um, it wasn't really the on the menu of every American who eats meat like it is today. Chicken was was a distant third to pork and beef for most of our history. Actually, um, there's some stats here the National Chicken Council. It's pretty fun. Uh. In nineteen sixty, Americans eight twenty eight pounds of chicken per capita, and just a few years ago, in twenty nineteen, that number was at ninety seven pounds, whereas red meat went from one three to one twelve. So you know, there there's been a big shift in um or a shift in the kinds of meats that Americans eat. Uh. And you know, chicken farming wasn't as big as beef and pig farming for a long long time. It's sort of a mom and pop thing, until they realized that people really loved chicken, and we can fortify them with antibiotics, and we can get those breasts unnaturally plump and get build these huge barns to raise them in, and basically like, hey, we can factory farm chickens just like we can cows and pigs. Yeah, So that that really boosted chicken consumption. And by the way, that nine pounds of chicken that Americans eight in two thousand nine, I think it equaled about eleven billion birds um. So the other thing that happened in addition to cheap, widely available chicken UM were new cooking techniques and the big cooking technique that really turned fried chicken from something that took like up to twenty minutes to cook correctly UM to something that you could sell as fast food where it was just using pressure cookers. So they would fry the chicken and a pressure cooker and still people still do it today, and the pressure would change, it would lower the boiling point of the oil, so the oil could get hotter and the chicken would cook faster. And if you did it right, if you bredded it right, if you use the right kind of breading, if you did you know, brine your chicken and all that first, then you could cook this stuff really fast and it would come out really good. Yeah. So now Colonel Sanders comes into the picture. Uh. You can't talk about fried chicken without talking about Harland Sanders. Uh. And he got a sort of a late start as far as his um chicken business goes. At the age of forty was when he started serving chicken in front of the service station he owned in Corbin, Kentucky. Then opened up a cafe, Sanders Cafe across the street, serving that skillet fried chicken that I love so much. And then uh nine, so I guess he was forty nine years old he finally develops this eleven secret eleven herbs and spice recipe cooking in the pressure cooker. Uh. The governor gave him his his his fake colonel ship. Uh he was he was not an army man. The current ship was bestowed upon him in an honorary fashion by the governor of Kentucky. And that's when he started dressing up like old Connell sandals and his white suit and his bolow tie and his little white goatee, and and a character was all of a sudden born. He became more than a man. I read a little bit about him. Apparently he had a he was known for two things, had a really really really really foul mouth, and was a bit handsy, shall we say. Yeah. They described him as a having a insatiable sexual appetite. And because it was you know, the nineteen thirties and forties, would kind of come into a room and just be like, hey, hey, who can I grab onto? Not kind of thing. Did not know that part? Yeah, that was? That was That's the legend. I have a Colonel Sanders story. Let's hear it. I was driving down the road one day south Troy, Atlanta, and I um was driving alongside a Buick and the buick had a Vanity license plate which ties into our license plate episode, by the way, and it said KFC C O L. And in the back uh the I don't I never know what that thing is called. But the back panel behind the back seat, between that and the window whatever that like the rear dashboard, I guess there was a Colonel Sanders bobble head and they pulled up closer and closer to the driver. I realized I was looking at the man who played Colonel Sanders throughout the eighties and nineties, and he, I swear to God, was wearing a white suit and a black string tie and he was driving down the road in the twenty one century in America. Yeah, I think it said Bolo ties that string tie. It's a little different. Okay, that's enough. But he was the t D actor. Yes, he was the the Yeah, Colonel Sanders was long dead by this time. This is the guy who played Colonel Sanders in all the ads for decades of I mean, I guess it was him, like, you know, run him off the road and interview him. But this is there's just no way it wasn't him. It was him. I could tell you by looking at him, and then you know the other kind of evidence. The vanity plaint in the bottle really kind of teared it for me. Uh My one favorite thing that they've done recently in the past few years is when they started casting all the different people to play Colonel Sanders. Oh that was great, wasn't Amy Sadie? She? I think she was. I know, I didn't see them all, but I thought that was a pretty pretty clever little twist. So, by the way, speaking of Amy Sadaris, this is gonna come out long after this, but do you know um Leslie Jordan's. Yeah, he just passed away yesterday. I'm super super gutted about this. Yeah, he was like just this great guy. If you knew him on Instagram, he was really fun and funny and all that. But like favorite Instagram accounts, some of the um some of the like interviews that I'm seeing of him now, and one of them was posted by Amy Sadaris where he's talking about how like he wanted to live a life of serve because you know, taking care of other people like brings you out of yourself. And he was just this great guy. Um And if you if you aren't familiar with him, go look up his Instagram account. And I didn't realize it at the time, but now I do that the world like really lost somebody special. So r I p um Leslie Jordan's. Yeah. I had seen him on like Will and Grace and other stuff like that, but his his Instagram account is where I just fell in love with the guy. Yeah, for sure, Hey, hunker downers. He was. He was great and I was very very sad to learn about that because I was just like I was watching him on Instagram like the day before, like hanging putin thing. Dave Hill, Well I saw that too, and uh. The other tribute is very good to read is making milayles Is. She's doesn't post on the Instagram much, but hers was very very sweet and sad. Yeah, alright, back to the colonel. Yeah, sure. He sold the brand in nine four for imagine a boatload of money, and it's a part of Young Brands, one of those humongous, uh nebulous sort of food corporations that owns lots of fast food restaurants. And it went from Kentucky Fried Chicken officially to KFC and apparently because the state of Kentucky said, you know that there's a lot of brands using our name, why don't we trademark the name Kentucky so we can make a little money off this, And so KFC said, we'll just go by KFC then yep, so um, which is hilarious that Kentucky did that. I wonder how much money they made from it. I don't know, or I wonder if all the brands just he said, all right, we're just k whatever. Right. It really harmed though, Kentucky black Powder must get ink, I think the hardest at any rate. Um, the I saw that when Colonel Sanders sold Kentucky Fried Chicken in sixty four, he immediately started trash talking it to open his own restaurant. They moved to block and from doing that, he sued them for like a hundred million dollars. They gave him like a million dollars and let him open the restaurant in exchange for him to stop talking trash about KFC from that point on. Yeah, he was quite a character. And also I mean like the fact that he was considered a possible running mate for George Wallace, the pro segregationist presidential candidate. The fact that he was kind of like, you know, a throwback to the Annabellum South with his ties and his accent and all that. A lot of people just presume he was racist. Um. And when Papa John's um had that scandal where Papa John himself like used that racial slur um, he he tried to say, like Colonel Sanders used to say that who cares? And apparently Colonel Sanders family came out swinging and we're like. They called Papa John a weasel and basically a scumbag and said like our grandfather, a great grandfather or whoever, like who did not use racial slurs. He attended black church sometimes like he was not He was many things, but he was not a racist. So you shut your mouth, Papa John, and Uh, I guess it worked. Uh. Popeyes came along to rival KFC is probably yeah, we're talking about friends kids arrival. Uh. Popeyes was founded in s Popeyes without an apostrophe. By the way, the joke was from founder Alvin Copeland, Sr. That he was so poor he couldn't afford the apostrophe, which is a great joke. But that was a Louisiana chain opened in nineteen seventy two as Chicken on the Run. Uh, people were like him. It was really not so great, so he spiced it up a little bit and went to a more New Orleans style chicken and changed to Popeye is named after the cartoon character No named after Popeye Doyle Gene Hackman's character in the French Connection. Fact of the podcast. That's the weirdest fact I could ever imagine. I mean that is a that is a trivia question right there for sure. Oh yeah, because you're setting people up because everyone's gonna say it's Popeyes because they're now using him as the logo like Popeye, that Gene Hackman and this little But you'd have to word it just so because you'd spook some people and be like, that's too easy a question. It's really here. You'd have to word it just right. So. But yeah, Copeland was He was a character as well. Um. I didn't read that he was handy or anything like that. Um, he raced speedboats. Uh, he loved spending money. He was a propertly get spender and he was not at all ashamed or embarrassed about it. Um. And one of the things he was well known for in New Orleans was his Christmas displays outside his home and they were so elaborate they drew so many people that like like sheriff's deputies had to direct traffic in the area around it because people would just park and stop and go look at him. So he was that kind of guy. And I mean there's a special place in the universe for people who spend, you know, freely on Christmas decorations. Outside of their house so much so that it attracts like local townsfolk who come in, like get the Christmas spirit from that kind of thing. I think those are special kind of people, agreed, I love it. Popeye's was eventually bought out again by one of these conglomerates called Restaurant Brands International. Really great creative name there. Uh. And you know there are KFCs all over the world. Um, there are KFC knockoffs all over the world. The SFC in Iran, Superstar Fried Chicken and PFC Perfect Fried Chicken in London, which I looked up to see how closely they were ripping them off. And the PFC the font is definitely the same font, but the logos and stuff look different. Okay, Colonel Sanders has like blonde hair right. Speaking speaking of Colonel sanders appearance, apparently KFC's most profitable nation is um China. Big. Yes, the people in China since have gone berserk for Kentucky Fried Chicken. Um. Again, it's more profitable in China than in the US. Um the offerings are a little bit different. Um, Like, there is fried chicken, but it's not the most popular menu item they have. You know, like regional dishes as well, and I think those are a little more popular. But one of the reasons um I saw floated for why uh Kentucky Fried Chickens so popular in China is that Colonel Sanders vaguely resembles Confucious and that there's like an affinity for him there. Oh wow, um it is double Uh. It's the biggest most popular fast food in China, double the size of McDonald's as far as a number of stores. And I think when they were first built in the eighties, it was a little bit of a luxurious thing where um, there was more room, the restaurants were really clean, and it was sort of contrasted with like street vendor food as a place where you can go and take your family that's a little nicer. Uh. And I did look up the menu items. You know, they sell kanji and egg tar. Uh. There's something called a dragon twister, which I really there's there's a cool article where this food writer went there and ate a bunch of stuff and wrote about it. But the dragon twister sort of looks like, uh, you know, when they'll take peeking duck and wrap it in like a thin pancake, almost like a roll with cucumber and spring onion and stuff. That's what the Dragon Twister is, except it's, um, it looks like a like a chicken uh not finger, Yeah, like a chicken finger. Right, it's a chicken finger wrapped in a chicken breast, That's what I'm guessing. No, it's that thin pancake, but it does have the sweet bean sauce and cucumber and spring onion. Look looks realiant I want one of those. If we have any listeners in China, please mail us at right, just drop ship it. And then also in Japan, KFC is huge, not as huge as it is in China, but it's become a national um Christmas tradition. Chaos the traditional Christmas dinner in Japan. Not I think you told me that before. I love that. Yeah, I think it was in a Christmas episode once. Yeah, that's good stuff. And then Korea, I believe they do not have well they do have KFC, but they took the KFC methods and turned it into something else, which is Korean fried chicken, which apparently, um, if you if you like fried chicken, you're going to like Korean fried chicken. And there's there's no reason you have to choose. You can like them both because they're so wildly different that there's no reason to choose. Just just love it all. Yeah, I mean they're not that different. It's it's it's still crunchy fried chicken, but in Korea they double fry it. Uh, So they fry it, well, they fry it once and then they fry it again, so it's gonna be once, not twice, but it's gonna be extra crunchy. Uh. And then they have a you know, they're known for this sticky spicy glaze that's on it. So like, Korean sticky fried chicken is really really great. I love it. It's one of my favorite preparations. Uh. A lot of people think that when American troops were stationed there after the into the Korean War, they may have introduced locals there and then they built on that on their own to to sort of make it their own. Which actually that might be true, because apparently prior to American occupation, they would steam their chicken. That's how they prepared it typically. Oh really, which is the opposite of crunchy. It really is boiled. Yeah, I don't know. I was wondering that too. Um, because I knew the steam part was coming back when we were talking about boiled chicken, and I wondered which is worse. I think boiled is still worse. Yeah, And like when your dog has an upset tummy, you give them boiled chicken. Oh, I hadn't thought about that. White ricking can be good if you're making like chicken salad. Yeah, all right, yeah, I just forgot. I forgot about that. I was just thinking of like throwing like whole chicken breasts and bones and everything in a pot and boiling it. Well, that sounds awful. Yeah, I mean, none of it is very appealing to me. After you've had fried chicken, that crispy brown goodness. Uh. That Korea is so good at they. I think in the ninety seven Asian financial crisis, a lot of people went into business for themselves, opened up their own little mom and pops chicken, uh and a beer and fried chicken is a very famous combo in South Korea. Great combo and America too. Yeah. And I think now there was a study UM in two thousand nineteen that found there were eighties seven thousand fried chicken restaurants in South Korea and that's three and a half times the number of Kentucky fried chickens in the entire world. That's that. Yeah. South Koreans love their fried chicken. But what's interesting is that, um another survey found that they don't actually consider it to be a Korean dish, even though they put such a spin on it that everyone outside of the world considers that particular kind of fried chicken Korean fried chicken. Apparently in Korea, they South Korea should say they don't. They don't consider that. No word on what North Korea thinks about it. Uh. There there there are some chains from Korea that are open now in America, one of which I haven't tried yet, but there is one in Atlanta, just have to drive a bit. There's one called bon Chon where I think it's in Fayetteville, which is things south of Atlanta. Somebody didn't do their market research first. Uh. And then there's one called Mom's Touch Chicken, which is just now arriving in America. Uh. And I think we should take our last break now. Yeah. Yeah, and we'll talk about some more variations on fried chicken, because why not? And things stuck stuck. I don't know that you know it's stuck and stuck. It's a great name. That's the name of it. It's a great name. Alright, stuck snet with in with an x so chuck when we go to Nashville. Let's just go ahead and say it. There's a really good chance we're going to do a show in Nashville this year. I was just next Nashville last weekend. Oh yeah, did you go to Prince's Barbecue Chicken Check? No, I went to the Stevie Nicks concert, but uh had a great time, And I was like, Nashville just needs to be on my list because it's it's drivable and like, it's a fun weekend and they've got Hot Chicken. We have a year too, but they it originated there. Yeah, hot chickens everywhere now. But yeah, there is a guy named Thornton Prince the Third who opened uh, Prince's Barbecue Chicken Check. I think they call it Prince's Hot Chicken Check now, I believe. But essentially every version of Hot Chicken that is out everywhere, from KFC to Dave's Hot Chicken to all the little like Hot Chicken operations that are just going crazy, and for good reason. Hot chicken is really really good. Um it all starred it in Hadley Park neighborhood of Nashville thanks to Thornton Prince the Third. Yeah, I don't love hot chicken. Um Oh, I love it, man. It's so greasy, nasty, it's so good. It is. One reason is because I don't, like I'm developing more of a tolerance for good heat here in my fifties, because I've generally avoided heat. But it depends on the kind of heat. Cayenne heat, which is the heat that is generally made to for the hot chicken is is one that kind of burns me more than is satisfying to me. Uh and and and it's trust me. It's fried chicken. Is one of the reasons I am so out of shape. But hot chicken is even worse because like they dunk it in in hot oil after they fried it and just sort of shake it out, so it is doubly bad for you. Yeah. The thing about researching this chuck is I was like, there's so much good fried chicken to eat that if you just selective, if you're just choosy and you just go to someplace like Princes where you just go to like like the best Korean fried chicken place in your town. Um, or you just you know, build a time machine and go back and eat some of Opal Bryant's fried chicken. Like you're not going to be able to eat it all that often. It will become a delicacy, which I think it should be treated as because it is really really bad for you if it's done right, and then if it's if it's done in any kind of way that's approaching healthy, it's not being done right and it's probably not that good. So yeah, it's really bad for you. But I think if you just treat anything in moderation like that, you can you can have it and enjoy it. That's my problem. What moderation for fried chicken? I know it problem. I treated as a regular just like this is just what you eat. I was. I was raised on fried chicken. I love it so much, but I do I do need to in in theory, you would, uh, you would enjoy it more and be like, hey, I haven't had having my fried chicken for the month and I'm really savorite and enjoy it. You don't even have to do like that. You could just be like I I want fried chicken but instead of like hopping on over to Kroger and getting it at the drop of a hat, if you make it so you have to drive to like a really good place, they have it less. Probably. I don't know how this ended up. This episode ended up in me giving you health advice because I'm not really the person you should be listening to about that. But here we are. Uh, yeah, I know, it is what it is. I'm working on it. It is what it is. Man. Poio campero is something we had in Guatemala. Uh and now they have those in the United States. There's one of Buford Highway and that is fried chicken with an adobo rub, which is delicious. Yeah. By the way, Chuck, two things. I was such a dummy that when we went to Guatemala with co ED, I thought, oh, the American chain has infiltrated Guatemala. There's poyo compero here. I didn't realize the opposite had happened, because it's been it was around in Guatemala starting in nine. And then secondly, I will also want to direct people to our ongoing co ED pledge drive to get to a million um. You can go to co Operative for education dot org slash s y s K and donate. How about that. I love it. I just saw the opportunity and I jumped on I pounced on it. Yeah. Take that twelve bucks that you would get for your third fried chicken meal of the week. Yeah, chuck, and donate it to Coe. Can we talk about really? Wait? Wait, do you really eat fried chicken three times a week? Well? It depends on what you're talking you know, I want to live your life, man. I mean, if you're talking about just like you know, if your chicken fingers here and there, are you talking about like a full like fried chicken and fried chicken meal? Yeah, no, that's not three times a week, but shooting chicken fingers No, no, no, that's not the same thing. All right, yeah fried chicken is No, that's not the same thing. Yeah, it's the bone that makes it unhealthy, right exactly. Eureka. Uh, we should talk about chicken and waffles because that is a great food combination. When I lived in l. A. Roscoe's was a place that I would love to go and take people from out of town who hadn't had chicken and waffles. Yet it's become kind of a sort of a trendy brunch thing. But it's been around for longer than I thought. Right, Yeah, it's been around since at least the thirties, with Well Supper Club in Harlem introducing a lot of the world to it. But I think it's gone back even further than that. But the question of whether it's Southern or not seems to be an issue. And if you ask um, a lot of Southerners will be like, no, this is not a Southern dish. But they think that black migrants from the South showing up in New York and l a were the ones that developed it. So it's still got a link to the South. It's just not necessarily a Southern dish. Um. Did you ever eat at Gladys Knight's House of Chicken and Waffles? No, because I was living away at the time when it was open, it was It was open till two thousand seventeen, Oh, in Atlanta. I thought it went away before that. No, it was open till then. I looked it up because I wanted to make sure I remember correctly. That wasn't there anymore, and that's not Unfortunately I missed out. Sorry Gladys Okay, it's amazing. She had such a great singing voice. When she spoke like that, well she was saving her voice for singing. Uh And jeez, I hate to go off track again, but since we mentioned her, I do need to mention that my favorite backing vocals of all time was the Pips on Midnight Train to Georgia. Really that if you just listen to the background singers in that song, just gorgeous, beautiful. Another thing you can do is go listen to David Lee Roth singing without the music. That's really something to listen to as well. Yeah, those are good. Or the or any music video without the music is always fun too, Yeah, especially when like you can hear their shoes squeaking and everything the sneaker squeak so um chuck. If you were alive and on social media in one there is basically no way you weren't aware of what's come to be known as the Chicken Sandwich Wars. Yeah, it was a big deal. Um. There's a gentleman named Truett Cathy who founded a restaurant called Chick fil A and claimed to be the first maker of the chicken sandwich in the nineteen sixties. We have, you know, literal proof that What he really meant to say was I'm the first white man to sell chicken sandwiches in a restaurant, because there had been chicken sandwiches going back to the nineteen thirties, um, in places like Topeka, Kansas. Uh. In Ebony magazine, they were uh, they were talking about the dish. Uh. So it's been around for a long time. Chakathy did not invent the chicken sandwich, and they need to stop saying that. But chick I don't think that. But Chick fil a is very famous for their chicken fried chicken sandwich with a butter bun with pickles, and so all of the all of the other fast food joints I think beginning with Popeye said wait a minute, like some of us are selling chicken sandwiches, but we should kind of just do what they're doing. And the chicken wars started. Chicken sandwich wars. Yeah. It somehow it started with like some subtweets and shade being thrown on social media and people clapping back, and between August of two thousand nineteen, when I believe Popeye's debuted their chicken sandwich in February, okay, less than two years eighteen national and regional chains debuted or upgraded their chicken sandwiches in just that short amount of time. And that's the reason why again is that's why it's become known as the Chicken sandwich Wars. And I was reading about it. I read one of the most corporate buzz speaky articles I've ever read in my life about the phenomenon of the Chicken sandwich wars, and this one executive they call them quick service restaurants now, not fast food restaurants. This one QSR executive explained that um Chicken has a longer innovation runway then things like burgers that basically burgers have been done to death. There's nothing more you can do with the burger they've been trying. But Chicken, it's wide open. But then this I think it was a hype beast article said at the end like, well, if the innovation runway so long, basically everybody's just coming out with their own version of the exact same sandwich, and are we really innovating at this point? And I think they ultimately said, well, if that's what the people want, give them what they want. Yeah. I I do agree though that I hate the longer runway corporate speak. But you can do a lot of things with the chicken breast, and it's usually breast that's being made for the sandwich. Good point. You know, you can have like a honey soy glaze, or you can have it like a saracha thing, or you can have it fully buffalo hot. Uh. You can throw some cheese and bacon on there. You can have lettuce and tomato like. There are a lot of I think, more variations on what you can do, so I would agree with that. Yeah. And speaking of hot, I'm meant to tell you Prince's menu includes a light mild, so not even mild light mild, so they've got something for you to chuck. Yeah. And speaking of hot, I also want to mention that cold fried chicken is even better. Yeah. It is really good. Yep, for sure, it travels well. Yeah. So the chicken wars are still pretty much going on. They're probably going to be going on for a long time. But I think it's turned into more of a cold boar than the hot war it was. Um, but Olivia helped us with this. I don't I don't know if you if we mentioned it or not, but um, we really can't finish this episode without talking a little bit about the science like why fried chicken is so good because if you stop and think about it, it is an incredibly simple dish. You just take some chicken, you dip it in some sort of flour based mixture. Um, you put it in hot oil, and then you eat it. That's really all there is to it. Yeah, it can be that simple. Uh. And that is a very simple like dry fry prep ration, the sort of the lighter the flower for me, the better. Um. But you can you can brine it overnight. That is a really really great way to make it super juicy. Um. I don't think he listens to the show, but I'm a big proponent and follower of Kenji Lopez Alt um great Instagram page and just seems like a good guy. And he's I think he's buddies with John Hodgman and Jesse Thorn and appears on their show. So shouting out Kenji Lopez Alt because he always breaks down food science in a way that's like really cool, like hey, here's why, like the reasons behind the fried chicken or the chocolate chip cookie, and here's what's actually happening and why I say to prepare or why people recommend you prepare things a certain way. Uh. And in this case, um Kenji Lopez Alt says, you know, you can add garla hot sauce, you can add dil, but really brining it is one of the big keys because you want to get that salt go in in like in a cellular way. Yeah. Remember our old friend homeostasis. So when you dip a bird or soak a bird in brine, which is at least one tablespoon per one cup of water, that's a basic salt brine. Um, the salt concentration outside of the bird's cells is higher than the concentration inside the bird cells. So the stuff outside migrates inside, and in doing so, it actually allows it to draw in more water. Because when you're frying chicken, it's actually and by the way, I remember our super Stuff Guide to the Economy and that one economist is like chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that every time I say chicken ever since then, I always think of him. But um, when you fry chicken, it's a it's a very dehydrating process because you're cooking it in oil that's really efficient at transferring the heat and So when you add um that much more water that ability a whole water, you you lose a bunch, but you still retain a bunch, which makes for juicy, juicy chicken. Yeah. And it also like helps break down the proteins and the muscles and breaking down those fibers is gonna make it more tender. Uh. It's all just gonna make it more delicious. Uh. That's why you brian your turkey before Thanksgiving. Uh. Since we're shouting out books, uh, Jake Kenji Lopez Al Has written quite a few, but had one out this year UM called The Walk Recipes and Techniques, where he just basically sings the praises of the walk and it's like you can do so many things in a walk, and it's not just about making a stir fry. So check out The Walk, Good Good book town on yourself, and also check out UM the this He was interviewed UM in an article in inverse Um talking about the science of fried chicken, and the author does a really good job of um tracing their own journey and trying fried chicken and gives a lot of great tips because it's a really as simple as it is, it's a very intricate process that you can screw up really fast if you let your oil get too hot, if you let the chicken brown too long, if you use the wrong kind of seasonings. There's you want to do some research first before you try it. But if you do it just right, it comes out like chuck will be knocking on your door if you do it right. Yeah, that authors Eric Decker. So you can also look at Eric Decker's recipes. Uh, you've got to use the right kind of oil. Different people have different things to say about oils, but you want to have a high smoke point. Um. So you know, everything from beef and duck fat to peanut oil to saffler safflower oil is recommended. And just experiment with it, get in there and trying to skill it deep prying. Really, I mean, it's all gonna be messy, it's all gonna stink your kitchen up. It's it's just a it's a lot to undertake. But um, that's why I don't really make it at home that much anymore. But it's good stuff. I love it. There's a couple of things you could invest in just real quick that are fairly cheap. One is a um grease splattering cover. Yeah, yeah, one of those. Take a little screen. It works really well, doesn't it's just cleaning it his gross. And then the other thing is a candy thermometer. You can get them for very cheap, and you want to basically get the oil to a very specific temperature when you're frying, and keep it at that temperature as much as possible. Yeah, Okay, that's it, and then go forth and make fried chicken. How about that? Yeah, just don't bred it too much. There you go. Wise words from Chuck. Uh. And since I said that, everybody, of course, it's time for a listener mail. Hey guys, long time listener, first time writer in, or want to chime in and let you know how much your show means to me. I'm a nineties kid turned dad, and I always find your shows delivery well cared for, as well as your constant vigilance to remain as unbiased as possible when presenting a topic. I have a young son I always try to set a good example for as well as encouraging exploration of the world around him, and I find Chuck's candidness about the ups and downs of raising his daughter particular really helpful. In my day to day anyway, Guys, I'm a city planner for a city in Florida and it's a public sector government employee in the heart of the sub South. Consistently find myself greeting my teeth, dealing with every flavor of quote Florida mand and listening to your show always revised my sanity. After a tough day at work as an urban planner, I found that your show is about urban planning. Central Park the World's Fair have been my favorite. Go Too is a new more recent shows on license plates in vasectomies helped spur my to do list of both renewing my registration and uh, you know the other thing too. Last thing. Very happy to hear that you guys are getting back on the road. Any chance for a Central Florida show in the future. Thanks for everything you do. Still trying to get my wife on in on the Worst Kept Secret and podcasting, but one day I'll get to her. Cheers. That is from Mike l and uh Mike. In addition to talking about Nashville, I think we're probably gonna I want to try another Orlando show this year, right, Yeah, why not? Let's do it. Orlando is a great town. Yeah, so I think we're we're gonna try and make one of our little swings hometown show in Atlanta and Orlando for Josh and then Nashville because it's close and we've never been there. Nashville for Princes. Yeah, well exactly was that, Mike? It was mike L. Mike L. Okay, thanks a lot, Mike. That was a great email. Thank you for that, and we're glad we can help you keep your sanity.
