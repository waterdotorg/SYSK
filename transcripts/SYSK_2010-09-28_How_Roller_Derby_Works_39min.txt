Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. This is Josh Clark. Charles W. Bryant is clearing his nose out across from me. I was laughing up boogers because you were singing Dolly Parton before we went on air. Yeah, I was. I Love Dolly. I'm hoping that was never recorded by Jerry secretly surreptitiously. We had a little out takes in a while. It's been a while, Jared get on that we haven't said anything funny in a really long time. I think that's the problem. Hey, Chuck, Hey dude, did you know that we are smack dab in the middle of roller derby playoff season? Yeah? Oh you did? Did you know that prior to nine? In this more now? But I would say we're smack dab in the middle of a roller derby revolution. Yeah. Yeah, We're smack dab in the in the middle of a roller derby playoffs season that is situated within a larger roller derby revolution. Can we agree to that one? Okay? Yeah? You're absolutely right. Um, roller derby it's kind of everywhere. If you are not into it, I'm sure you've at least seen some cool posters or stickers on cars supporting roller derby leagues all of a sudden. Um, and if you notice that there really weren't any prior to two thousand one, you're a pretty sharp person, I would say. So. Um, we have our own roller derby league here in Atlanta. The Atlanta roller Girls have been I have not. I've seen him on cable access though, is that your Tuesday night just watching? I know, I actually don't remember where I would have seen him because I don't even have cable access or cable or anything. Right now, we need to go. We need to make a point to go. It's like right down from my house. It's on Ponds right, Yeah, the europe shriner Um Temple. Yeah, oddly, all right, we'll go Kauds, you know, Saturday, September twenty, which is probably before this will come out. Um, that's the that's the next playoff. I bet if we took Jerry, she'd know like a third of the people there, you know, the Yeah, so Chuck. The Atlanta roller Girls are one of UM sanctioned leagues. Yeah, because when did Tracy write this article, Like maybe two thousand six. Yeah, I think that the the w f t d A, the Woman's Flat Track Derby Association, has been around since two thousand four. She did not acknowledge that in this so it was probably two thousand three. Okay, So since two thousand three h Tracy cited there's about thirty leagues. Now there's ninety eight sanctioned and another forty three that are apprentice leagues. They're up and coming. Yeah, right, so there's a boatload of roller derby going on around this country. I was looking on the UM Flat Track Derby Association site and they have like the you know, links to all the different teams pages, so they have the logos of each one, and I found the best one, which one my favorite was the Dutch land Rollers out of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. They have like an Irish woman with the head kerchief on with a black eye Amish or Irish amishka. Did I say Irish? Yeah? She might have been Irish too. Did I say Irish? He did? Stinks because I really meant Amish. That's right? So is that their whole get up they all wear amish gear. I don't know, I just saw the logo. They probably do because they go with the themes generally. Yeah, but that's that's for later, right, So Chuck, let's talk about this. Let's talk about roller derby and by let's talk about it. Let's talk about its history. Yeah, from what I can tell, Josh, Um, in the mid nineteen thirties, there was a sports promoter named Leo Seltzo. Sounds very like sports promoter from the thirties, dedn'ty. Yeah, we need a roller derby c and that's basically what he said. But initially it was um, you know, they used to have all these endurance competitions back in the day, like the dance fons and all those silly things you did before television. His was initially a roller skating endurance competition. It was called the Transcontinental Roller Derby. Yeah it was. And the idea was to do fifty seven thousand laps, which is about the distance across the US. It's about three thousand miles. It's a long way to scape. But they all kind of realized this kind of stinks and it's not very fun. It does. Plus, skaters were skating about eleven and a half hours a day. Yeah, it's not fun, right, And I'm sure there's a pretty sizeable cash processes during the depression, so you could make people like wrestle bears and tutus and all sorts of crazy stuff to you know, feed their family. Um, so I'm sure that's why people skated eleven and a half hours a day for these things. Um. The problem wasn't that it was is too much for human constitution. It was that it was boring. It's just people going around the track again and again and again, and then ultimately it's like, Wow, they just skated across the US. But in the meantime it's boring. And there was a sports writer, a very famous sportswriter named Damon Runyon, who in nineteen thirty seven came to sell term. Was like, look, dude, this is a good idea. But the coolest part is when people run into each other. Why don't you make something like that really emphasizes that. And apparently Selter was like, I don't know, it seems kind of rough, and we'll give it a shot. And all of a sudden, the next thing you know, you have like nineteen thirties ladies just beating the tar out of each other. And have you seen footage of it? It's pretty awesome, it is. I mean back in the thirties too, I think of everyone is so genteel and everything. No, it was just as rough and tumble as it is. And he only had the endurance version for a couple of years. I think before he was like, you know, you may be onto something, right and and from that point on that's roller Derby, yes, Josh. And it grew, uh, you know, it was very popular during the forties and fifties and uh, clearly if you remember, like Happy Days, I think there was a roller Derby Unhappy Days. At what point didn't Pinky Tesscadera participate. I don't know. I was wondering that earlier. See it seems like she'd be too cool for that, but she would like beat up the girls after the match. Maybe that's pretty bad. I don't know. Well, we'll have to look that up. Leather tuscan Arra wouldn't or was that her sister? There? Two of them was Leather nickname I don't know that off, but they they It did grow in popularity up until about the seventies. I think a lot of things declined in the seventies because of this stinking economy in the gas crisis, and so people weren't going out and spending money on things like roller Derby anymore or skateboards. Skateboarding. It went. It had an opposite effect, that didn't it. Yeah, it boomed, I think because that awesome documentary, The dog Lords of Dogtown. Is that a doc Well, there was a documentary and then a feature film based on the documentary. But the documentary is better. But yeah, swims, they couldn't have. People couldn't afford to like fill up their pools to the polls right out. They skated skateboards in the pools, and that Stacy Perelta was one of those who would go on to phone how Pelta Skateboards a skateboard company of all time? Who would sponsor the greatest group of skaters of all time? The Bones Brigade. Yeah, yeah, but that has nothing to do with roller Derby except for the wheels. Well, it does actually have something to do with roller Derby in this case. That the dock is always better than the feature film. You just hang onto that one. Sure, put that on your back pocket. Well, it's interesting though, and that roller Derby did decline in the seventies, but that's when it was actually probably most visible because they had those televised I remember when I was a kid. Oh yeah, they televised it on like a year old kids with five and nights seventy five And um, I sent you the link earlier and we watched a little bit of his clips. If you YouTube like nineteen seventies roller Derby, you can see some of this stuff, you can, and you can hear the commentators. Um. When when they tried to revive it in the seventies after its decline, Uh, there was kind of an artificial revival where roller Derbut toured the country in civic centers and small towns like an exhibition, right, But there was like different there are different teams, but like the the announcers were the same, and the announcers used a lot of colorful language, Like there was one womansoyn. There was a woman who was like I think they cited or waited about two hundred pounds. She's like a big blocker, um, and she the announcer said that she was roughly the size of the state of Rhode Island. And it was just kind of like even on the YouTube club, the person who posted it said, I apologize for the announcer saying that one of the skaters is the size of Rhode Island. It was anything went back there in the seventies pretty much. But um, even that didn't didn't keep er Derby into the eighties. Like that kind of um fantastic misogyny and the kind of um world wrestling look and feel that it had to it. Yeah, they took it sort of over the edge to where they would like fake hit each other and stuff like that. Right, Um, but that that that didn't that didn't keep it alive. Right, And we should say also that that revival is significant and that it foreshadows the century revival because it was all women prior to that in their forties, the fifties and the sixties win Like during the heyday of roller Derby, it was co ed. Yeah, well not co ed on the same team they would have like them. The teams were co ed. I think periods were not co ed. Oh see, I thought it was women competed in the same night as men, but only against each other. I think teams were originally co ed, which is which uh has grown from the the first roller Derby where they were twenty five teams of one man and one woman, and then that carried on. So I think the teams are coed, but different periods it would be the male team or the women's gotcha, I think, but the men kind of went away for the most part, and now the modern revival is all ladies. Right in Austin, Texas in two thousand and one, a group of women got together and basically single handedly revived roller Derby into this really huge incarnation that we're seeing now right. Well, yeah, and like we said in two thousand and four, just a few years later, the Women's Flat Track Derby Association was formed and they pretty much run the show. And we should mention that, you know, flat track means that well, it's clearly not a roller rank at the Shriner's Auditorium in Atlanta, but a lot of them use roller ranks. And uh, instead of the curved bowls, the banked, Yeah, the bank bowls that they used to use, but they still have those in some places. And I get the impression that flat track and banked kind of go head to head. Well, yeah, the one lady they interviewed some women trace she did for this article, and she said that they'll they'll debate that, of course, but it's really all in the spirit of the sport. They're still like sisters. And there's a I should say, there's a documentary about that UM formation in two thousand one in Austin called Hell on Wheels. Huh, And that's that's where I saw footage of UM, the old timey nineteen thirties roller derby people just beating the cramp out of each other. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. But then there's a feature film based on that. Yeah, that Chuck. I don't know if you remember, but on the way back from Guatemala, you were watching it, and I was watching you watch it and like every once and I will just be like, yeah, Ellen, Paige Andrew Barrymore in the same movie It's that's a rough one. Drew Barrymore directed that, I believe, and produced it and basically paid for it. Yeah. It was called Whippet and it was said in Austin and um oh, I hesitate to say I didn't like it very much because you never know Drew Barrymore as a listener. But I thought about that too. It was good, true. I think it put it on the map Fox Show. Definitely, it brought it into the mainstream. How about that? Yes? Okay, and Jimmy Fallon was just terrific as the announcer, and isn't he always Future Man was the coach Class Act. So that was whip it. Let's talk about the spirit of roller Derby, Chuck. Okay, Um it is fishnet stockings and two twos and knee socks and black eyes, big elbows. Um, all kinds of costumes, awesome names. Oh yeah, right, so just in this article alone, Atlanta roller girls. Um, Susan b Agony, that's my favorite. It's pretty good. Um, let's see who else is there, Chuck, While I saw Jackie Daniels, which is kind of good. Some of them play off the tough like liquor bottle thing like our friend. Well, we should also say to our friend Debbie freak Girl. Freak Girl dot com is her blog and she's a freelance writer. She did not write this, but she is new to Roller Derby and I post some questions for her and we'll get to those throughout. But her name Tobe. We can't have her doing voice whatever it would be cool. Her name is Molotov cupcake and she makes she's really good cupcake baker. So she's incorporating her love of liquor and explosives and cupcakes into one. And I should also mention too, my favorite name of all time. This is from a listener about a year ago, wrote in and her name was sudden Beth. I thought, just sometimes the simplicity of a name like that, Sudden Beth. There was in the um Helen Wheels doc one of the original roller girls was um Betty Ragette. I like that one too. Yeah, yeah, apparently beyond According to Molotov, cop Cupcake is uh the worst biggest blocker you've ever heard of. Yes, history of big girl, and she is uh like size. That's one of the cool things about roller Derby that Debbie points out and that the league points out, is that physique does not matter you you have a skill set you can bring whether you are a two and fifty pound blocker or you're like Juno and you can just zip through people real fast. Page I know, Okay, sorry, you look stupefied. No, I know, but it's you know, that's part of the fun of it all. It's picking out your name and and designing your uniform and your look as a team. The one from New York is they have one that's really cool. They're all have like a checker cab theme, so they have like checkered hose on and like a yellow cab skirts and shirts like bowling shirts. It's cool. I think that the one the common theme. Uh. If not, it's not physique like you said, It's basically just cheer, guts and and an ability to stand up to torture, including self torture, right, which is um, pretty much the basis of training. Yeah. Like Debbie was telling you in in that little mini interview you conduct did with her that, Um, she had to do plank positions, squats, push ups, what else? Um, well all of this is in skates, by the way. Well I was going to add that at the end that's like the sucker. Okay, you can't put the kicker in the middle. She did. They cover basic she said, it was boot camp on wheels and squats and all sorts of like physical training, all on skates. There you go. Which, Um, she's in the new in the on the New Jersey Hell Razors with a Z team and they practiced two hours twice a week, and she's been training for four and a half months and just finished her basic skills tests, right, And so when you're when you're training, like she was just talking about basically um calisthenics, but there's like training as well, like you throw yourself on the ground to learn how to roll and get up really quick. Because it's not just getting up, like you're getting up with four wheels on each foot and people zipping by you. That you have to learn how to jump over people. That's a tough one. I have ever tried to jump in skates? And have you ever done any disco boogie in or anything? Like I was an ice skater? Okay, role bouncing? No, all right, did you see that movie? I saw parts of it. Yeah, it looked pretty cool. They still do that in New York. Some in the seventies like Disgust skating and do everything in New York. Now that's off New York. Um. You also have to skate at high speeds, Chuck, I understand. Yes, there's a actually bullet in this Tracy Wilson article it says skate at high speeds. There's also one that says you need to stretch out beforehand. Yeah, that's a big one too, um. And you have to start and stop in skates, it's what Yeah, but I think to be fair, I think that means like you need to start and stop on a dime precision, high speed skating, dodging, jumping, balance control, all on four wheels, eight wheels, just alright to check. That's the training part and apparently it's not. Um. There's a a very um delineated process to it, and you keep the newer people away from the more experienced people according to Debbie fresh Meat. And then you actually have to pass a test to be calm, like in a sanctioned UM flat track derby association UM participant you know, yeah, like you, I guess you can't actually participating about until you're cleared by them, right, yeah, because it's dangerous. You know, they don't want you out there getting hurt. Um, although people do get hurt all the time, clearly, Uh should we talk about that and now we'll talk about that later. Well, let's talk about how to play. Yeah, Like, because even after reading this and understanding the rules, unless you really I think it's probably one of those ones where unless you're there or you're very familiar with the two teams, so you know who's who. It's tough to it just looks like a muddle of like elbows and fists and stuff. And in the More movie they handle that kind of clumsily just by having a segment where they explain the rules. Do that? That's like, did Ellen Page to explain the rules? Because that's what she did an Inception two. Remember like every every like thirty minute, she'd stop and look at the camera and be like, okay, everybody, it's refresher. She didn't explain the rules. I think Jimmy Fallon did. But it's necessary in a movie like that because when you look at a roller derby match, if you don't know what's going on, you might just think it's mayhem out there because it looks like mayhem. But there's actually, uh, not just rules, but there's also strategy to this as well, which makes it even more awesome. Right, let's hear it, Josh, Okay, Well, Chuck. First of all, let's talk about the different kinds of players on the team. You have two teams, and to these teams are going to play about five players each. Right, um about is a series of shorter races two minutes tops, but they can be shorter than that. They're called jams. Jams. Right. So you have a jammer and this person is delineated by a star on her helmet, right, the jammer. Uh, there's a jammer on each team, and the jammer is the only person on these teams who can actually score a point, right, right, So here's the deal. You've got a jammer on each team. You have three blockers on each team, and the blockers don't have anything on their helmets. And then you have pivots on each team. So if you're looking at the starting line going back, you have the two pivots have stripes on their helmets. Yes, thank you, Chuck. And the pivots act is kind of like the you know, like a catcher in Major League Baseball is kind of managing what's going on on the field, same thing. Uh. Tracy also compared the pivots to like NASCAR NASCAR pace cars. Yeah, they set the pace of the of the game base but they're also like calling moves out to the rest of the team. There they actually plays. Okay, thank you right, um, So, Chuck, going from the front back is the pivots, the blockers, and then the jammers and the pivots and the blockers all take off when the ref um blows his whistle the first time, and then after about twenty ft actually after exactly the ref blows his whistle again, and then the jammers take off, right, So their whole point is to sneak through the crowd and get ahead of them and come all the way back around, lap them and go through again. Yeah. I get the idea that the jammer is clearly the speediest and and probably most skilled skater and probably the most velt slinkiest person who can just kind of like get through. I would think so, yeah, but I would think you'd have to be extremely um skilled because you're you're probably having to jump the most. Like, your whole job is to go forward as fast as possible. There's many trying to keep you from going forward, right, So you get a point for every player as long as everything is above the boards an inbound and we'll get to some of the the um the rules and penalties in a second. But um, for every player the jammer passes after the first lap. Yeah, the first lap, there's no points, right, No, but that establishes the lead jammer and we'll get to why that's important in a second, but for every every opposing player the jammer passes that their team gets a point. Right, So the lead jammer is the one who comes out of the pack first through the first lap, no points are scored, but the lead jammer has the ability to actually stop the jam when you act that out right by and by putting her hands on her hips or touching her helmet and touching her hips a couple of times I've seen as well, and that means the jam is over and there's a break in between, and then you start another jam, which is a part of the overall about Is that right? That's right? And we were wondering, I wonder if Debi emailed me back, why you would call a jam before the period is over, the two minute period, And we both surmise that it's probably a strategy thing if you feel like like they're calling out the points. I believe if you're up on points, you can just go ahead and call the jam and you've won that jam. Right, You're you're locking the other team out of a comeback from that jam, right. I think that's probably why they would do it. Why else would they do it? So that's pretty much like a standard jam. Yeah, that's how it's scored. And there's actually there's a cool um flash animation on our site. Did you check it out? Now? I watched a YouTube thing in the article. It's um. You can just click and you make all these little people that you're seeing from overhead go around and yeah, it's pretty nat. It's fun. It gets the point across very well. So Josh, there are some other rules, uh, specific rules, um, because it's not just a free for all, like you can't trip and stuff like that. So we'll read a few of these. Off. You have to be in bound. You can't go out of bounds to pass an opponent in order to score your point. UM, like you set, I believe you can pass the jam or responsibility over to your pivot. Is that right? You can match Apparently there's something on the helmet that you can I guess the star comes off, um, and you can pass it during the match, but the lead jammer status doesn't transfer. Oh, so you can't call the match or the jam. Sorry, it's more complex. In college football, UM, you do not receive additional points if you fall all to the back of the pack and then pass the same player. So you can't ZiT by everybody, then hang back and do it all over again. Once you pass that player, that's your point for that player, right, you have to come all the way around again and lap them, right, And if you actually lap the other jammer, that's more points. That's called the grand slam. That's called money in the bank, my friend. That's the big daddy move of all time. Okay, and I imagine that's pretty hard. I would say a jammer probably has to go down for that to happen. Yeah, or your jammer just has to stink. Yeah, it could be a poor, poor jammer. So what what's the deal with the blocking, because obviously you're not just skating through each other. Your purpose as a blocker is to keep them from going by you. Okay, So I think the rules are the rules slightly very a little bit here there league the League. I get the impression, but some of the very common ones are you can't block with your armfully extended. Definitely, no clothes line. Yeah, that's stuff you've seen in the movies when they hook up together and clothesline. That's just that's not that's not right. Or they might do that to timid hand. You can I think you can hold hands, but neither person's arm can be um fully extended. Okay, um, you can't throw. You can throw elbows, but you can't throw elbows above the shoulder. Generally you can't throw block um actually blow mid thigh was at mid thy Now you can't fall on purpose in front of somebody, as awesome as that move is, especially to fall and the person jumps over you, because it's like burn. Uh And what happens if you break these rules? As you go to a penalty box just called the sinbin the sinbin, so like an ice hockey, you can spend like thirty seconds to a minute in there, which is you know, that's like half a jam. Or you can if you commit a major you can be completely uh like removed from the scene, like fighting, removed from the scene. The police come like you the you know, any kind of ding or I think deliberate falling is a major infraction unless the person jumps over and goes not true, or if you foul a skater while they're down, or if you give the referee too much guff, I think they can throw you out. Dramatic and subordination Yeah, um, I know the roller girl's um sin been is a waiting pool and at least Circuit two thousand four, I just say, right, there's a there's a picture of m one of the roller girls in a in a waiting pool, and there's like a wheel of fortune that you spend to find out what your penalty is. I got a few more things here from Debbie. Okay, Chuck. She said that she had not been on roller skates since she was fifteen. Yeah, because that's a big deal. I don't think roller skating is like riding a bike necessarily. Uh No, it's like riding roller skates. And she is she's about my age now, which I'm not gonna say how old Debbie is because I just want to be nice. So um. She said that there are there are women that have never been on skates before though in her training. And I asked her about the bonding aspect of it, because I think Debbie did it because she was looking for something fun to do and an activity, a physical activity to you know, help her keep in shape and stuff like that and stuff. Well, she said it's the hardest thing she's ever had to do physically, but she said the bonding has been the most surprising and best part about it, she said that after feeling sort of awkward initially as being the new girl, she's all of a sudden has eighteen new girlfriends and they're real supportive of each other. I think, she said, one of the girls is in a band and they'll go and see her play. And I'm sure some of these uh ladies probably eat her cupcakes. You know, I'm sure too, So it's a it's a good you know, uh, it's a good supportive scene there. And I think part of it has to do with the fact that men aren't allowed and so it's uh women feel empowered to have a sport to call their own that's rough and tumble. And her niece even remarked she thought it was cool that there's a sport that boys aren't allowed to play. Yeah, it's very cute. And and another factor that Debbie likes, and I know that most of the women probably like, is that, you know, you it's fun. You get to dress up. She says, she gets to wear cute skirts and knee high socks and then go beat the crap onto somebody and then have a beer with her later on. So the sex and violence, I'll rolled into one. You gotta chuck. But I mean that's as American as it get. I think you just came up with the new slogan we should pitch that. Yeah. Uh, And there is tons of violence. There's a lot of injury, although from what I've seen of century roller derby compared to nineteen seventies roller derby, there's far far less violence, but I think it's um more frequently real. Um. Yeah, there's a lot of injury, a lot of soft tissue injury, contusions. One of the roller girls interviewed in this article broker tailbone twice. Have you ever fallen on your tailbone? You're just yeah, you've come nowhere near breaking it, but it's just like it's really jarring pain. It's awful breaking it twice. I can't so it happens. You couldn't catch me out there. Man, they're way tougher than I am. Yeah. What's the fish net injury? What's that called? Uh? It's called fish net burn. It's where you fall and slide while you're wearing fishnets and at least like the stippled burn on your on your leg. I got hit and I gotta tell you it's not nice. It's not nice. I got hit in the face with a baseball when I was a kid, and I had like the baseball stitches embedded in my face. I don't know why I felt they need to tell you that, but it's swoll shut dude. I got hit in the face and dropped to the ground and pick my head up and my eye was already swollen. Shut. It looked like an Amish woman. I did, chuck, Josh. I guess that's about it, right, Well, we we should say if you want to support UM, we are coming into playoff season. Oh wait, hold on, let's talk about that. These leagues are. There's like pretty much no paid professional rollers roller girls. They're all They pay for their own equipment, They pay dues for the league, right, um. And a lot of times these leagues are pretty much de facto charitable organizations. Yeah, it's awesome, like they donate to um local charities in the community. UM. And even better, there's some corporate sponsors like PBR is a big corporate sponsor, which means that they just funnel money right to charities for these groups. So if you go pay to see a roller derby, you're going to um be helping people. Probably they have raffles and stuff and they sell swag, and I think there's comic books. Yeah, they sell swag, they have the it's just um. So, like I said, we were approaching tournament season. The w f t d A has a championship tournament in November seven in Chicago, and uh first and second and third place teams from each region if four regions East, North Central, South Central, and West earn a spot at the championship, and there are Big five tournaments in September and November to determine who goes to the ultimate Championship. Yeah. So the roller Girls, the Atlanta roller Girls playoffs are going to be in Lincoln, Nebraska from October. I was about to say, is that the closest one, but looking at these, that may be the closest one. Yeah. And if you're in Sacramento from October one third, check out the West Region playoffs. Yes, the East Region is in White Plains, New York September. And for all use Skannis out there, I know we have a lot of scanty fans. September through twelfth in Green Bay, you can go to the North Central playoffs and you should probably build a time machine to do that. Ah. Yeah, so, Chuck, I hope you went. You want to talk about Roller Derby in cinema? Yeah, I mean, whipp it. What else is there? Is that Roquell Welch movie, Yeah, Kansas City Bomb, and that's a very famous one. There is also The Jammer, which is a stage play by Roland Jones. It's about a love story between two members of a classic co ed team. Okay uh. And then there's an Any documentary called roller Girls. Yeah, that was in That was a one one year deal in two thousand and six, I think.
