Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and um, he's got duct tape over some cardboard that he's wearing on his chest, which means that this stuff you should know the Lark podcast or all right, I'm just gonna say that like every five minutes. Well, and this will be a fun one larb. All right, I'm not gonna do that ever again. Yeah, I think we should just call this, um, Dungeons and Dragons follow up, UM, D and D two nerdier than you thought it could be. You know. Um, some people, as is written in the end of this article, believe that the in the introduction of Dungeon and Dragons was the that's the citation for the beginning of Larpe. Yeah, that makes sense. It's just like kind of one step further, you know, the people that really get into D and D and sort of role play at the table. That makes sense to me that that grew into let's just take this out to the park across the street, you know, or hang out in front of a movie theater when the New Star Wars is gonna premiere. Yeah, I guess that's LARPing in a way, isn't it. Well? Do you remember the wizard that came by for that Triumph, Yeah, when Triumph went to the Star Wars premiere. Yeah, I've seen that guy in New York, the wizard. If he's not a LARPer, I don't know what is. I think that's he's just a wizard. So we should we should probably tell people who don't know what LARPE is what larpe is. LARPE stands for live action role playing and, as you probably guess from context, UM is usually fantasy based, sometimes sci fi, sometimes goth But basically it is everything that a D and D game is or a role playing game is, but actually physically acted out by people who are dressed up as their characters, who are like going through physical motions. Um, it's real battles, right, and it is. It's because of that, because you're actually doing these things, it's considered much more immersive than just an average role playing game. Sure. Uh, and we should mention that throughout this. We're gonna be um. There was an interview conducted for this article. This is written by Tracy Wilson. UM. Stuff you missed in history class, and she interviewed someone named Lari zoel Kosky. I did say that, you say that, and she Larry, I guess is local. And I think she has even invented her own larpe game. So what she did is called King's Gate. Yeah, so Tracy interviewed her. So we're gonna be using bits and pieces from Lauri. Um, so we thank her in abstincia. Um okay, So yeah, I looked up King's Gate. It was purchased by Red Button Productions. She actually sold it, yeah, and they brought her on as the creative director. But um, I don't see, I don't, I don't, I don't see like that was in two thousands six. I believe I don't see her um her name anywhere in regards to that, And I don't see King's Gate. It's much more like archived now, so I think it's like kind of had its day or whatever. But hey, she still catched that check for two seventy. I mean, I imagine, like making money from creating a larp game is pretty unusual and rare. I might look into that, actually, because when I was reading this, I was thinking I could create a LARP game. I might not want to play it, Yeah, but I could totally create one. Have you seen some of like the like the rules and all that, and like how granular it gets. Yeah, I mean it's not something you rush into. In fact, I think Laurie said she spent about a year or a year and a half creating King's Gate and she even used existing rules. Yeah. Sure, what you can do if you're creating a game, you can lease rules from other game crews. We've gotten way. Let's let's yeah, need to back this larp truck up. So you mentioned that she creates this game like a larp is an actual game. It's basically like creating a new universe and saying the new universe is going to be at the state Park on these three days, and if you come, you either have to be a character that you've designed or that have been improved by me, the game designer, um, and you're you're going to follow the rules of this universe and things are going to happen within this universe and that will be our larp. Yeah. And like you said, the universe isn't something that you can you think, well, how hard could it be to sketch that out over the course of like a week, but it gets really grant new, like you said, and you've got to think of everything, like what does race mean in this world? Is there electricity? Can people read um? Or what what are the classes like in the difference between the classes? What kinds of weapons do they have? Um? Is their magic? Answer? Yes? Yeah, always magic, that's the answer. UM. And like you said, you can eat they. I guess they have existing rule systems out there that you can nick from, or you can make a combination of that in your own, or you can just make up all your own rules, right, which that has to be so involved, Yeah, because I think one thing you don't want to do is invite fifty nerds with foam rubber swords out to the park and have unanswered questions, right or a dissatisfying game, you know, like how could you not think of this? Like can they read or can't they read? Um? And a lot of it follows the same like rules that you'll find in like a a like a traditional role playing game like Dungeon and Dragons, Like there's armor classes, there's hit points, there's things that determine since the people who are, like you said, engaging in combat don't actually die, you have to keep up with a way of simulating their death right. And so there's there's rules, the intuitive rules that you can just kind of come up with just from playing Dungeons and Dragons and being aware of that kind of thing. They apply to this too, but I think it is a little more even more granular, because you have you have not just the rules, but you have the game itself. So there are three different uh types of not types of people, but different categories of character. I guess that you can participate. You can just like a D and D, you can be the game master um or because LARPA is a bigger, more immersive time and sense of thing. It's probably just not run by one person that you're probably you might have a plot committee and be on you know, like a group with a group of folks trying to like sus this out basically, right, Yeah, exactly, especially if players break off into smaller groups and you kind of know what's going on, like mutiny. Uh. There are non player characters in PCs UH, and that I wonder what the draw is for that. Those are people that actually aren't advancing in the game or playing to win. Tracy gave the example of like you might be the the innkeeper or the bartender in the pub that tells you, you know, don't go that way, that the dragon is that way, right, that's probably you're doing. That's like a LARPer who has a drinking problem and doesn't like to move around too muss, so they just sit in the tavern and wait for people to come by and make up stories about you know, bandits or whatever. I guess the answer is it's the same person who would want to or not the same person, but the same idea behind someone who doesn't mind playing the tree in the play, you know, as opposed to trying out for the lead role. Like we need our bit players and we need our stars. I think. Also, probably if you have a Larpe game, um, and so like an actual three day weekend at the park will be a game. Uh, and then those games might take place over some sort of um, consecutive order in the time that's in this Larpe world, um, and that will form a campaign. But if you have like a game like King's Gate that the lady who was interviewed for this created, right, um, you're you're gonna have kind of an organization of people who help you carry out this game in real life, and I imagine they probably play nonplayer characters. You think that's who I would think, does it? That makes sense? You know, they're almost they're almost like administrators of this right. They're not game masters per se, but they're like the game master's right hand people. They still like sit and break bread with the game master, which I think some people like being the inner circle. Maybe. All right, So then you have the player characters, and those are they can develop new skills, they can learn things, they're trying to win. They're actually a part of the story. I'm sorry. The NPCs are part of the story. The PCs are experiencing that story, right. So, like, if you are the game designer or the game master and you created this particular game or campaign that you're sending people out on, it's not just a free for all, like you, if you need to keep the narrative moving along, you will create like that bartender character, right, So that person is there and they're going to be there when these player characters come for the weekend um or there the bandits that the bartender warns everybody about, they're gonna be out there in the woods they're non player characters, but they're part of the game. So anybody who's not part of the designed game that is playing and has a foam sword, that's a player character. I think I would like to be like a wild card NPC, like the right hand man to the gamemaster. And if the game master was like, oh crap, I forgot like no one knows how to get to the eerie Cave, I need a need in an innkeeper, and I could just like get in the character all right, I'm an innkeeper. What do you need? What do you need from me? Innkeeper? Boom? What do they call that? Is that character acting? Yeah, i'd be I'd be a character actor. What if the gamemasters like, crap, we didn't get enough bolognay for all these people and they're gonna be upset come month's time. Can you go get some more? I can do that. I can be a bologna guy. Um. And you mentioned the game the game itself. UM. A game session can last a few hours, a few days, and that can or cannot be, or may or may not be part of a large your campaign. From what I saw, games typically last like three days over a weekend. I think the campaign thing is kind of cool though. Yeah, like you you you have your battles over a weekend and then you take that back and apply that to your risk board or you know, your whatever maps you've drawn up in the world, and like, all right, now we know that, uh, this territory is now owned by whoever the victor was. And what does that mean because now they're advancing towards this group or something. Right. Yeah, from the interaction of the players and the game both change. Like the players. A player might die, a player is going to probably gain some experience points or maybe some hit points or whatever, or a new weapon. Um the game itself. Like if you created like a central monster or something that needs to be killed, that monster may be killed. So in this world that you created, that monster no longer lives. So this this thing, it's it's um dynamic, it's not static. It Yeah, another to evolve. It's really cool. Have you seen Step Brothers? That movie? No I haven't. The Larpe features heavily in that. It's pretty funny and it doesn't know role models too. Oh yeah, Step Brothers d c Riley and Will Ferrell. Right, if I hadn't seen it, so I didn't know, no, no no, no, Yeah, role models, that's what I meant. Yeah, yeah, he gets his confidence at the end. Yeah, and apparently people get their confidence from larp in in some cases. Um yeah, I thought that movie was better then I thought it was gonna be. And apparently David Wayne, the director, said that that's his highest compliment for that movie is for he said, people come up to me often and say it was a lot better than about What's Gonna be. Yeah. The way it was marketed was really like dumb and low brow and it was just gonna be just a dunce of a movie. But it had like a lot of heart and thoughts to it, and there was a lot of conflict and it was funny too, like if you get a LARP game going with my At Walsh and Ken Jiong, you're you're on the right track. Comedy was in it, alright, So, um, Stepbrothers, what a dope. I'm sure people were like, no Strothers. The great thing is that they started their emails and then hopefully stop mid sentence. Yeah, Stepbrothers funny too. The Catalina wine mixer, Um, all right, so there are three like Catalina addressing no cat the island of Catalina, the coast of l a um. So there are three different types of games, three ways you can play the game. There's a battle game, and that's actually when dudes and ladies get out there. They're fully armored up in their cardboard and plastic and they someone gives a signal and they charge each other like it's you know, uh, what was the mel Gibson Braveheart and they you know, they beat each other about the head with foam swords. Yeah, and like there's there's restrictions on how to make what's what's called a boffer. It's a um it's a larpe weapon. And typically it's anything from like a sword to mace shield, um yeah, battle ax, bow and arrow. But there's there's standards for it. Like they usually start with, um, a piece of PVC or a piece of bamboo. It's heavily padded and wrapped in duct tape and then you know it's it's tricked out to like be to look like a sword or to look like a bone arrow or whatever, and um it it doesn't do any damage, but it looks cool, especially when you're like this is a pretense sword and it's mine and I built it and I'm gonna kill you with it. Yeah, what are them? What's that website? Tracy recommended it was. I went and checked it out. It was actually pretty good, so did I. It was called Leucrane's Guide to Boffer's l U k r Ai n Apostrophe s and it's you go, and it's got all the weapons there that you could ever imagine and how to make them, an advice and all that good stuf of um. All right, So that's the battle game and Dark Con is one of the most popular ones, and that is an award winning documentary as well. And I checked out the trailer for that just to see it. Did you see that They kind of echoed Braveheart, you know, in the way they shot it, but it's, you know, it is what it is. It's kind of funny. But they interviewed some people in there that you could tell, like this one lady was like, you know, I don't have control at work, I don't have control, and here I don't have control. They're like when I lark, I'm in control and that's what it gives me. And this other guy was like, you know, I became ended up becoming the man, I wanted to be through the fantasy of the character that I wanted to be. Yeah, I'm sure, like if you kill a few elves over the course of a weekend and come out of like a larpe game, like really on top, that has to translate to the rest of your life. Well, it's just like winning anything, whether I mean, I don't care what sport or competition, any kind of competition that you participate in and come out on top or just get something out of, it's gonna benefit you in your life. Yeah, it's just because society deems of support is being worthy of paying somebody tens of millions of dollars to be able to play it. It doesn't mean it's any more valuable or victory there is any more valuable than one elsewhere. Agreed, very open minded Josh. So then you have theatrical games. Um, this is mainly like sitting around in your house with storytelling with cards and dice and things that I thought to know, there's this whole world out there. Well it can be that though that but that's like, that's what it is like. If you sit around and do this in your house, people are gonna be like, this is what you invited us over for No, that's not true. There's all sorts of of theatrical games that people just play, like on a Friday night. Okay, the ones I found, we're all like really involved, really widespread and kind of cool. Look, well, it's all over the map. There's one called Fiasco that I actually want to buy and play. It's a movie larp, theatrical larp, and it's like very Coen Brothers ask like the movie plots and you act out these characters. And but that's the one where you sit around play with your friends. All Right, it sounds kind of cool. But so what's the other half. Well, the one I ran across, the the big um, the legendary one is called Vampire the Masquerade. Yeah, and there's like classes and tribes and races of different vampires. And then there's other ones. There's like ones based on mummies. There's one based on sin eaters. There's like demon ones. There's like just different um like whole worlds. Man, they've created entire worlds. They have whole histories and they're acting these things out and it's very much like a large except it's far more subtle. Literally the theater maybe in a theater. It'll be in a much larger place than like somebody's living room, um, maybe like a conference hall or something like that, with the lights turned down or something, and everybody's decked out as like vampires from like the Victorian eras, and it looks really cool. If you go read up on these things, like just just going from link to link, it just becomes more and more and more involved, and you like it's incredibly thought out. The rules are incredibly complex. The big difference between that and like combat um LARPing is that like if if say a vampire goes to attack another vampire, they'll usually roll for the outcome. They'll play like some sort of some variation of paper rock scissors or something like that. Um And And that's how it's more about the the story and intrigue and um and that kind of thing, rather than like running into battle against one another in the woods. I think if I I would sneak in my big boffer when they were like all right, Chuck, you know, do your rock, paper or scissors, and then I would pull out the big boffer and it just like a hush would follow over the right, like you can't bring a boffer right, especially because you would have fixed like a squeaky toy to the egg when the head to make a really goofy noise and they're like, you're not playing right, and I would just boff everybody like you all dead, all right? And the final is the role playing game. And I didn't really understand the difference, to be honest, I was gonna ask Tracy, so maybe you can explain it. Do you know the difference between this and like a battle game or is it sort of like theatrical combined with battle? Yes, that's exactly what Okay. Battle game is just running against one another and beating the tar out of each other. So there's no larger story going on. No, no, necessarily. I think if there's a larger story than you just created a role playing game. Okay, all right, I get it that I would want to play a role playing game. Then it's got everything. It's got the best of both worlds plus bologna um. And like we said, the rules are really the most important thing. Like I get a feeling that in all these games the rules are just sac or sancta. If you don't follow the rules, then people get upset, and then the whole thing just goes into chaos, you know. So let's talk about some of them, like combat rules. Well, like we said, um, you're simulating death or injury. Yeah, you're not actually inflicting this, So you have to be able to tell how, um how how I guess how many hit points? How much health a character has. When you're being hit with a sword, like in a certain area, typically you you're forced to call out how many points you just lost. So Tracy says, the combatants call out how much damage they inflict. That seems a little I would rather play a game where it's up to you, as the one that's hit with the foam arrow, to say, all right, that's three points I get hit in the chest with the foam arrow, rather than some jerk take all three points hit you with my arrow, right, you know, right? Like, I think it should be up to the person who gets inflicted. That's just me, And ultimately it would be up to the game designer to decide who who who calls that out? That would be a rule, I guess. So. But if some guy came up and bough me in the chest and then stood over me to many how many points? That would be a problem. I would say, probably you should stay away from large games because I guarantee that's what it's like. Okay, uh we mentioned magic. Imagine magic plays a big part in most games because why not. You know, if you're going to do a fantasy game, you might as well throw magic in there. And throwing is is pretty important. Well, yeah, I would like to see some of this actually, um, because there's the two components. One where you cast a spell and do an incantation, and then when you cast your spell at the end, like you said, like you might throw a bean bag or a little pouch of bird seed and you have to hit the other person with it for your spell to have had there's physical skill involved, right, So physical skill if you get the incantation wrong um or if you um miss, the spell doesn't work. And um. Also like if you're a new character, if there's not you're only gonna have access to certain number types of spells. Yeah, you can't just say like I can do this spell as much as I want, exactly. That's that's part of the rules as well. But you mentioned this skill like throwing is an actual part of skill that's considered a hard skill, Like in real life, you are good at throwing. You have the skill with pigging people with little balls of bird seed. Right, your soft skill would be magic like the made up skill that you're carrying out, and those two combined would make you good at casting spells. Right. Or like Tracy says, if you're a good cook, you may really cook or make the bologna sandwiches. If you're not, and that is your character, you may have something that like to find out how good you are. I thought that was a little granular, but I'm sure that's important in keeping like the immersion going. Yeah, you gotta stay in character. You know death, Yeah, yeah, you can die. That's sort of the point. But because no one wants to spend two weeks making your outfit in your boffer only to get stabbed in the chest within the first eight seconds of a battle and then you're just all you have left is your bologna sandwich. So most games will allow you back in the game um again, depending on certain rules. Resurrecting your character is generally part of the front of it. Yeah, and so either like a player character or nonplayer character can resurrect you using a spell. Um. Oftentimes, there's limits to how many times the character can be resurrected. Yeah. So I imagine if you're a character who's like on your last life in a campaign, and you're headed toward the state park this weekend. I but you're a little nervous. Yeah, that desperation, like that's palpable. Sure, Like that adds to the whole thing, the enjoyment in the drama, because people are going to be gunning for you, or conversely, people might be out to protect you too. That's true. You might learn who your friends are that weekend. Um, a lot of folks. Sometimes sometimes there's a scorekeeper that just keeps track of all the stuff. Sometimes it's up to you. Yeah, that's different from the game master. Yeah keepers just numbers. Yeah, just spreadsheet. I imagine that's a very specific person as well. Um, A lot of times you you have what's called a life ring, and it's a key ring has these little tags on it that say like whether I'm dead or whether or not, Like I've got four spells I can use and as I use them, I'll take them off my little ring. Just too, I guess help you remember keep track of everything that's going on because it's complicated, or if it has hit points you're you're pulling them off, going like oh that one hurt. Oh, I'm bleeding, I'm about to die, meeting bologna sandwich. Ye. Uh. The other thing too, they will have many times is a a non participation area because that's where you guess so like let's say you do get knocked out of the game, like you don't want to just go sit in your you know, chevette and you know like player music your yeah, it probably has led zeppe um oh man, nothing will get you more charged up for combat than like immigrant song immigrants is um. So there will be like a little cordoned off area where like you can go have a cigarette if you're into that, although kids, you shouldn't be smoking, um and just socialize, you know. It's just a big part of it. You're making friends out there, and who are your friends? Who are the people that play these games? Well, uh, Lari Zlokovski says, um quote, most of them are very imaginative, people have a taste for genre fiction, are highly intelligent, and are in some sense usually a little bit different socially, she says, um, and that's a big part of it. Maybe you don't have a lot of friends and this is a good outlet for you to make friends and create this cool fantasy world and like we said, like build up your self esteem. Um yeah, man, that's just so neat. I like that there's a place out there for people who lack confidence. It can go like get it absolutely man, because you know, the dumb jock might get that on the football field. But Lucas may not be able to play football. You know, he's too tiny. He's a little Corey Hamees, so he might. You know, they had Larpe when Lucas was around. He might have been able to get the chick from the goonies. I can't remember her name. But but he didn't, and he dies young because there's no Larva. That's the right movie. Did Lucas die? I don't know. That's why I'm asking you, Jerry, she says, I think so? Does he really? Spoiler? No, I don't think Lucas died. Keep thinking of Brian's song, Jerry. Yeah, or Rudy Rudy, Rudy Diesudy still alive? Actually? Oh really, who dies? She said, Lucas? Have you seen John dies at the end? No? Is that good? It is good? Yeah? All right, So spoilers all over the place. So well, it's in the title. Well, no, no, no, I'm just talking about Lucas, so, uh, you can't. What we're saying is you can't pigeonhole, right, LARPers. You have to have three pigeonholes for LARPers. Uh. It turns out there's a guy named Peter Brockman. He wrote an essay called the three Way Model UM and it was included in the book as Lark Grows Up Theory and Methods and larp. Yeah, there's another essay called the three way Model that it has nothing to do with at least one other UM. And Brockman says, Okay, there's basically three kinds of mindsets among LARPers. You've got the dramatists, the gamist, and the immersionist. And really, honestly, um, probably most LARPers are a combination of these three. But there are three pure mindsets among LARPers. Yeah. The dramatists obviously is going to be way into the story and the plot maybe helps write the story. You know. Well, you can also take all three of these and transpose them onto the game designer as well, Like it applies to the characters the player characters and the designers. Yeah, the gami ist, Um, they're really into the mystery and maybe uh creating these puzzles for players to discover. Um. And then the immersionists. Immersionists obviously are like way into becoming these characters. Yeah, I mean if you're if you're the character and you're really into the character. Everything else is kind of secondary to that for the immersionist. And then there's the administrate administrationist. Yeah, the the the person who keeps score. Yeah, it is a big deal though, Like you can't just show up at a park with seventy people and overrun picnickers. You know, you probably have to reserve your spot and maybe look into insurance and the licenses. Usually. Yeah, like there's a little more red tape probably than you might imagine. Um. And thank god there's people out there that are willing to pitch in and help out like that exact. And usually it's the again, the game designer's inner circle that is helping out. And uh, Laura Zolkowski says, in this case, usually you're more looking for reliability than even talent and creativity. Just having people you can depend on is you know, worth its weight in gold. Jerry just texted me from three feet away and then said, Lucas doesn't die. That's great. I didn't think he died because he's not sick, he's just small. Yeah, he died in real life. Maybe that's what she was thinking. Oh yeah, Cory Haynes. But he was growing up then. Yeah. No, there's like a kid dies young powder. Maybe we'll figure it out one day. If you know the answer to that, let us know. Uh, well, that's the end of Lark, buddy, you got anything else. No, we'd like to hear from Marker's for sure. Red that Red Button Productions that Zolkowski sold King's Gate to. They do it like every month. M every month they have it Lark. Maybe I'll get my feet wet and go watch. Oh you will be sucked in immediately. Somebody will hand you a sword in a blowny sandwich and you'll be like, I'm in. Well, I'll bring my boffer just in case, but I'll just go watch. Do you have one? Handy potato guns don't count. You can't shoot people with those, or US retrofitted steampunk nerf guns, yeah, which are pretty cool. Actually, Yeah, if I had more time in the inclination. I would make one. He can just by one, put duct tape on and be like, look what I mane. If you want to know more about LARP, you can type in l A r P on the search bar how stuff works dot Com and will bring up this article. Uh. And since I said search bar, that means it's time for message brick U now, Chuck, it's time for listener mail. Yeah, this is called capgrass murder. Dude, dude, Oh yeah, I heard just at the People's Court theme. No, I did cat scratch fever. All right, that's what I thought you were saying it like cat grass murder. Okay, I thought you was in People's Court. Even still, this this is pretty serious. Hey, guys, love the show. I have a story about cap grass syndrome. What do you remember this one? Yeah? Okay. In the early my family moved from Detroit, Michigan to a small farming community in northern Michigan. Hillman. We got a great deal in the house that we moved into, and soon found out it was because there was a double murder in that house. Unfortunately, his son murdered both of his parents. We were able to determine where when we changed the carpets. That's gross. It is super gross. And you'll remember in crime scene remediation, Yeah, episode, someone did a bad child, did a terrible job. You sup to tear up that sub floor. Um. When questioned it's the way he did it, he kept saying he did not kill his parents because they were still living down state. He was convinced that they were not his arrants but instead impostors. I remember that one of his defenses was was that he suffered from cap craw or capgrass syndrome. Dude, we got lots of stairs in the neighborhood and we weren't really sure why until we found out the names. The people who were shot were named David and Norma Douglas. My parents were David and Elizabeth Douglas. Creepy. The town, being small and not very accepting of strangers, referred to my mother as Norma he even though her name was Elizabeth. That's not very nice, no, and that's creepy too. Um. We were never really sure if it was out of jess malice or other reasoning. It was a little concerning, though, because we were always worried that if he ever got out of jail, he may go back home only to find that David Norman Douglas still lived in the house. It's a val concern. Um. Thankfully that has never happened, but it was definitely worrisome at the time, and we occasionally still check from time to time to make sure he's still locked up. And I hope I occasionally you mean, like every three to six months, um, take care of keep up the great shows. That is from John Peter Zak, That poor guy man. That was one of those things where it's like, oh my god, this is so what a bizarre conditioning, and then like the more you learn about you're like, oh, what a horribly debilitating condition. Yeah, that was a sad one. There was also, maybe my opinion, our most interesting episode subject. We um, there was a guy in the neighborhood in New Jersey, in the small town in New Jersey I looked in that murdered his parents and he apparently wrote their names on the shotgun shells, which is like there's a bullet with their name on that kind of thing. I would say that was premeditated. Yeah, there was no accident. Well thanks for that, Chuck. Sure, that was like a listener mouse supplement's right, h if you have something to say about one of our episodes, or what were we asking about from the lark community. Just you know, what's your experience been like. Has it built up your confidence? Maybe?
