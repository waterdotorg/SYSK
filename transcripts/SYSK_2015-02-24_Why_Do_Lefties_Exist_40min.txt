Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W Chuck Bryant and Jerry's over there too, and this is stuff you should know the podcast. Man, oh man, I would love for people to just lie on the wall in the studio. Sometimes get squashed. There's a lot of fun prerecord today. People. I hate that you miss out on that kind of stuff. But you know what, that's a that's for us. We we deserve a little something. Yeah, and that's called pre show fun, fun, hammering out the details, hammering other details. I thoroughly enjoyed researching this one. Oh really, it burned my brain a little bit. It burned my brain a little bit too, But um, I just I didn't know anything about handedness and uh no not don't use your hands much. Well, I mean as far as, uh why you are left or right handed or ambidextrous. It was all kind of new information for me. I feel like I had read that Io nine article, which we should give a huge shout out because it was forming partially the basis of this UM episode. Yeah, why are so few people left handed? From Io nine and they sourced a lot of great stuff from Discover magazine and their articles, so and science and science, so it's legit. It is legit. Uh, possibly even to legit to quit yeah, yeah, which I could not do with my left hand. I guess I can't. I just did it. You just did to your science sign signing to me. I'm equally bad at at doing too legit to quit finger motions with either hand. I'm right handed, by the way, what about you, I'm right handed, but that is weird since you have your mc hammer pants on. I thought you would be good at that. That's all just it's not hard to put on pants. It's hard to do too legit a quit finger motions. Yeah, I'm right handed. Um to well, I was about to say, to a fault, but heavily heavily right handed, because after reading this, I do believe that there is a bit of a spectrum. I think, um oh yeah, yeah. I think. I think some people are way dominant with their one hand, and some people skew more towards you. I can do some things with this hand, uh, And some people are ambidexterous, which we'll talk about. Very few, though fewer than you. Think, yeah, But um, I am heavily, heavily right handed. I cannot do many uh what's the word I'm looking for? Um? Fine, not like my fine motor skill tasks. I cannot do very well with my left hand. I can just like club things and smack things and knock stuff over, knock stuff over like Frankenstein clearing a table pretty much. What about you? And can you do anything with your left hand? I used to think I was, you know, pretty much just strictly right handed, But then i've it's especially researching this, I paid attention, and I'm like, no, I used my my left hand a little more than I thought. I'm definitely not ambidextrous. And if there is such a thing as a dominant hand, it's clearly my right. But this this article points out, or actually it was a science m article that said, there's there's this idea that there isn't a dominant hand, that you have uses for both hands, and one kind of specializes in one thing and one specializes in another. And the the example they used to illustrate that was, um, cutting like meat with a fork and knife. Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that, you know, Like I was thinking about I was like, oh, yeah, I guess I do use the knife pretty well with my left hand. I thought, crazy, No, my fork is in my left hand, my knife is in my right hand. And then I switched the fork over to my right hand. That's what I did too. I was gonna ask you that. So I'm definitely right handed, but you know my left hand does a great job holding the steak in place with my fork while I cut it with the knife. Yeah. Well, I'll come to think of it, though, I play guitar in drums, so I mean I have some left hand skill, I guess. Um. And I know if you break your dominant hand, you're gonna learn pretty quickly how to adapt. So it's possible to learn, uh, if forts to. It's all very interesting to me. It is, and we should say, if you happen happen just randomly to be listening to this episode on August thirteen, Happy National Left Handed Day, I looked out. When I looked that up, I was like, I wouldn't it be one of those another stuff you should know coincidence If this was happened to be released, No, not even close. Um. And it's good that left handed people have their own day because they've been fairly maligned throughout the millennia. Yeah, let's talk about that. Actually, okay, Um throughout history. In fact, even if you look at the words uh throughout history, there is a you know, uh the poopoo left handers. Basically like the word l y f T left yeah from Anglo Saxon means weak and the words where the word left comes from and the word sinister from Latin is the word for left. Yeah. Anybody who saw that episode of The Simpsons where Ned Flanders opens the left Toorium knows that because because I have a sinister reason to invite you all here sinister meaning left handed man. And that was when he announced the Leftorium. That show was so smart, you know, very smart. So many of those jokes like just flew over my head back in the day, Well, they're coming back to roost. Uh. There's a long list of um countries who have languages that link the word right with being good uh and the left with being bad or wrong uh. And in some countries even making hand gestures with your left hand is a no no. Well, and a lot of countries are a lot of cultures that eat food with their hands. Then utensils. Um. Using the left hand to eat or do a lot of things with is considered taboo because the right it's exactly right. You use the right hand to eat with, use your left hand to wipe with right and um, I think if you pay attention and notice, I'll bet you have a hand that's dominant and that that um activity wipe in your butt. Yeah, yeah, I'm alrighty are you? Yeah? Okay? But if you if you try the other hand, it will feel very weird. Whatever whatever hand you use normally, it's gonna feel weird if you use the option, and you'll just send it very messy. Sure. I wonder if you had a subconscious thing like you know, I was just eating these candy pecons with my right hand, and I know I'm gonna go back and eat them with my right hand. Oh, I don't even use my hands to eat them. I'm a little too germ conscious. I scoop food up in the crook of my elbow, which is very clean because it doesn't come in contact of other stuff, and then I eat out of the crook of my elbow. That's pretty funny. Um. So why have people been I mean, why have they picked on left handed people. There are some theories that is just a minority. You know, ten of people are left handed, and throughout history minorities have been picked on. That's right, this one thing, Um, there's there's at least a couple of cultures that equate left handedness with clumsiness. Yeah, that makes sense to me. Some hypotheses theorized that UM tools tool making for a very long time, UM has been done following right handed techniques. Still is in many cases, sure, um. And so when a lefty was trying to make tools or do whatever using right handed tools, they would have been clumsy with them. And therefore the idea that left handed people were clumsy or weak or whatever could have developed and carried on. Yeah, like, uh, colonial day, dad is teaching his two sons. Let's go with the son and a daughter. Even, let's how to use a saw. And you know, the son's left handed and he keeps he can't saw well, so the dad's just like he favors the daughter because she's you know, she's better with the saw. It's just it's easy to see how that could happen. Like he's mad at Roger but pleased with Prudence because prudence. She's always sawing things. Well, that's a colonium name, right, Yeah, sure, well I feel like it is. Okay, well what else is there? Who? Goody? Uh, goody, Alice. Okay, it's timeless. Um, but there's still that if you're lefty today, you might be frustrated with things like scissors and can openers and spiral notebooks and things that sort of U favor the right handed. Yeah, we're sitting next to a right handed person at dinner. The elbow thing, it's the worst. It's because there's so few left handed people. If you're planning a dinner party, first of all, it's just common courtesy to know the handedness of all of your guests, and then to put the appropriately right to put the left handed person at the end of the table so that their left hand is their left elbow is off the table and they don't have to worry about bumping into other people. Yeah, my mom is left ended, my father is right handed, and you came out right handed. Yeah, crazy, I sure did so. Um. Despite everybody knowing that there's a right handedness and a left handedness, it turns out, after investigating this kind of thing, science is really baffled as to what exactly is going on, why we would have handedness, yeah at all, where it comes from. Why the proportions seem to be steady. There's a lot of questions that you know, come up when you look into handedness. Whereas you know the average person who just kind of take it for granted, but no, not the average scientists. No, no, no. There are a lot of interesting theories though. UM. One is is that, uh, as we all know, we have a left hemisphere in the right hemisphere of our brain, and we are one of the only mammals that are very much UM have a it's called brain lateralization when primarily, and this isn't a cross the board, but primarily one hemisphere controls certain things and the other controls other things. And that is primarily controlling the opposite side of the body as the hemisphere. UM. But language and um controlling your you know, fine motor skills like things you do with your hands and your fingers. I have often been linked because uh, they are generally on linked together and on one hemisphere of the brain right for for the most part, people who are right handed. They make up the vast majority of human beings by the way. Yeah, I saw as low as seventy, but nothing lower than that, you know, eighty didn't Yeah, you're right, sorry, exactly. Um, those people have their language center in the left hemisphere, and I guess also their motor cortex in the left hemisphere, and the know the left and the U. There's a lot of questions about why this would be when the brain supposedly is a is always looking for efficiencies as much as possible. So they're saying, okay, well, these are two very human activities speech language and using your fingers to do stuff, right, So, um, they're also some of the more complex activities that humans engage in. So it makes sense that you just leave it up to one side of the brain so that these things can um not have to cross over the corpus colossum. Yeah, it's it's just a cluster together. It makes sense. It does make sense, but it's also a pretty thin explanation. If you you could also say the other the exact opposite, that it would make more sense that our motor skills and our language skills would be in opposite sides of the brain to give each other a break, rather than just weighting it down on the same side. The point is, though, as if you crack open a human brain and you look for the motor cortex and the language region, the language center, you're gonna find them most likely, statistically speaking, on the left hemisphere. Hence more right handedness. Right because of what you said that um that brain literalization where stuff that's carried out in the left hemisphere is going to manifest itself in the right. So if you're shaking somebody's hand using your right hand, the left hemisphere is is blowing up. That's right. If you're taking in um visual information with just your left eye because you got your right eye closed or it was poked out by a seagull or whatever, then your right hemisphere is going to be active, right, that's right. Interestingly, though, if the opposite isn't true, if you have your language center in your right hemisphere, it doesn't always mean that you're going to be left handed. It means you're more likely to. But um, I like the way this article looked at it. It's it's an evolutionary rule of thumb. It's not. I think they said between sixty one and se of lefties have the language centers on the left. Um over of right handed people, which raises a really great question, are is there such a thing as right eas and lefties or is there such a thing as right ees and non right ees? Because if there, if the if a righty and a lefty are equally exactly the same thing, if handedness is completely um binary like that, then if you're a lefty, your language center should be on the right hand side, and that, like you said, that's just not the case in most lefties even Yeah, that's true, and uh I O nine article also points out that it's they don't know why necessarily, but this is just how we evolved. It could have just been the opposite right and then we'd have more lefties, right, Yeah, well that's the idea. But I think, um, there are a couple of the explanations, possibly of genetic mutations along the way too, In particular, UH one about two hundred thousand years ago that basically mutated us to the fact that we are going to be more right handed in the in the language center is going to be on the left hand side. And then more recently, um, there's a theory that there was a second mutation uh between twenty thousand and a hundred thousand years ago where that basically balanced things out, or it canceled that out, which means the possibility of left handedness became a thing, or else we would have all been right handed. That makes sense too, It does make sense and that the humans possibly evolved to use their hands more, and by using their hands more, our brains were forced to become specialized and basically forced to choose. So then some sort of gene was set up that made the developing human brain most likely to be a right handed person. Right, And then that second gene came along and canceled that out in some parts of the population. I think it's the D gene and the C gene. Um there are two alleles, which is the manifestations of a gene at the same location, and the D gene is more frequent in the population, so it's more uh promotes the right handed preference. The C gene is less likely within the gene pool UH. And so there you have like a fifty fifty chance of being left handed if you have that C gene. Okay, I got you, Yeah, But you don't have a being a left handed person in general. You have about it only if you yeah, because the D gene is more prominent, and that means almost certainly you're going to be right handed. Okay, So the caveat we should add to all of this is that, um, this is all just strictly conjecture. UM. And we'll get to a little more of this conjecture right after this. So, Chuck, we're saying that it's possible that genetic mutations far back in human history account for this, and UM, there's a lot of evidence that there have humans have been mostly right handed for about the last two hundred thousand years. Fossil evidence suggests this. Looking at um Neanderthal skeletons, early human skeletons, UM, you can see evidence on the skeletons of right handedness, and they think that it's so obvious and obviously prominent because these people were using things like spears, So if they did have a hand preference, then a spear would definitely develop that arm connected to that hand, and it would stay in the fossil record through the skeletons. Right. They also have looked at other fossils as far back as one point six million years. There's a skeleton called, I want to say, the Kokomo Boy. Even though it's not, but I love that song. It's the Nario quote, my boy, you love Cocomo. Sure uh And he is at one point six million year old Homo air Gaster. And um, they he was clearly right handed as well. Other fossils have turned up evidence of right handedness them the teeth. Striations on the teeth suggest eating with their right hand. So what we what we can stay with a pretty decent amount of confidences that at least for the last two hundred thousand years, humanity has been a majority right handers, and there's been maybe about this constant ten proportion of left handed people, which makes the mystery even more crazy to me. Yeah, but it also makes sense that um an early tool building and teaching how to use tools, UM, I mean it holds true today. They've done studies that you know, you teach your son or daughter to tie a tie, and it's it's going to be more difficult if they're left handed and you're right handed for them to try and do it with their left hand, so or they'll pick it up easier if they go against their instinct and learn it how you've talked with. The studies have shown that so you learn faster from watching somebody and then using the same hands that they do. Yeah, and that makes sense. Back in the you know, with Took took in showing his pal how to use the bone to smash skull. You know, it's if he picks off his buddy picks up with his left hand, Took Took's gonna shake his head. No, no, yeah, use right hand or they're just gonna you know, they want. Everyone wants to fit in, even back at in the old days. Well, that's actually a suggestion of why left handedness is possibly not a little more prevalent among a certain age group today because it was equated with being weird or off or crazy or whatever. Um. And parents and teachers would force children to learn how to write with their right hand, effectively wiping out a lot of the left hand to population. Yeah and um, just jumping back a minute, I wanted to mention something important that the whole correlation versus causation thing, um with the whole language center link. Uh, it's not necessarily that that's a correlation. They appear to be strongly linked, but no one is saying that because the language hemisphere is on the left side of your brain that's causing you to be right handed right there there. And again, the reason that they are linked in a lot of scientists minds is that speech and fine motor skills are basically uniquely human, almost uniquely human. And it's just a little it's kind of like a red flag or a signal that they're both usually in the same hemisphere, and they do seem to be connected. And one hypothesis for why they're connected I thought was pretty smart. Um the idea that language spoken language emerged out of gestures hand movements, which we require fine motor skills, right, but I don't have trying to do the two legit to quit things. But the idea that language emerged out of that would suggest some sort of connection between the two, Like maybe the fine motor skill section is the more ancient of the two, and then language evolved out of that. But we also still need our fine motor skills to like eat with a fork and knife and everything, so it's stuck around. It didn't become obsolete just because we started speaking. Yeah, I like that theory. Um. We we did mention that this is a largely uniquely human trait um, But they have followed. Uh, they've basically been looking at our closest ancestors to try and figure a lot of this stuff out. Although it did see some studies that said that, like, cats are left handed because they'll go to swat things with their left hand. But um, I'm not so sure about that. Yeah, there's not only is it difficult apparently to um test or do you attribute handedness to an animal, it's also difficult to attribute handedness to a person because the idea of whether or not you're left handed or right handed, Um, it's still questionable. Like if you write with your right hand, but you actually can write better with your left hand or something like that. Right which what are you? Yeah, is the one you're comfortable with the one that you're actually better with? Yeah, that's a good point. Um. But they have been looking at our our primate ancestors since about the nineteen twenties, and they have found patterns. Um. Apparently lemurs and are more left handed, and other prosim uh persimians um, Macaques and old World monkeys for the most part are evenly split, and gorillas and chimpanzees are about thirty five lefty. Um, But this is interesting. The more, as they say here, the more primitive, the primate, the more likely it is to be a lefty, which goes in the opposite of the gene mutation. It's the exact opposite. It implies that we were originally left handed as primates, and then as we evolved, we became right handed. So therefore right handed people are more evolved than left handed people in some weird way. Yeah. So again it's another inconsistency where and of course this is in primates too. Um, that doesn't necessarily mean it's the same thing with humans. No, definitely not. But I mean, if you're looking at our ancestry and trying to figure out where handedness came from, you have to go pretty far back right, And I that's a pretty good example of how this body of work or knowledge is very contradictory. Still, yeah, it's baffling, it's pretty awesome. Hey, Chucky, you sent me something about um ambidextrous nous. Yeah, I thought this is kind of interesting from mental flaws like, like, it was just kind of my understanding that anybody who said, oh, I'm ambidextrous knew what they were talking about. But it turns out that's really just not the case. For the most part. It's a very rare um condition. I guess you'd call it yeah, UM, because I don't know if there is as a strict definition for what constitutes being ambidextrous. Like a you know, a switch hitter in baseball doesn't necessarily mean they're ambidextrous. It means they've taught themselves to hit from the other side of the plate. Um. If you notice, as a baseball fan, you're never gonna see a player that hits uh equally as well on both sides, Like you know, the great Chipper Jones here from Atlanta, he favored one side of the plate. Although he was a switch hitter, he was a much better hitter. I think it was as a lefty and not as a righty. So that's not a dextrous now, someone who's taught themselves because it's a valuable skill in sports to be somewhat embeddextrous or in a lot of sports. UM. But as far, I think writing is one of the things that they can look at um as a clear indicator of which hand uh you're you're best at, And they say about only about one percent can write equally as well with either hand. So that's like super low. Um. Apparently too So this handedness and this um lateralization of the brain and division of labor and all that has a lot to do with how your brain is connected. And apparently handedness is a part of that too. So like, for example, UM, people who are ambidextrous UM are more likely to suffer from schizophrenia, to have schizophrenia. And there it's not just UM ambidextrous people. Apparently lefties UM show a greater propensity towards schizophrenia. Something like people with schizophrenia are left handed, which is a very high proportion considering the general populations, about ten percent, and UM more than that, dyslexia and stuttering as well, right, which suggests that left handedness has an effect on how your brain is wired. It's not it's too simple, Oh my my hand is I use my left hand. My my brain is otherwise the exact same as a right handed person. The brain does appear to be different in some ways, especially in the ways that it's connected. Yeah, the um. We we talked about synesthesia before, one of our favorite Uh what do you call it? Not a condition? Is it? Yeah? Is it? Sure? I always just think of condition is something that's uh, you know, derogatory yeah, like a malady or something. I mean, I think that falls under that one is one, but the other one isn't necessarily that one. So like a malady is a condition, but excerption is necessarily malady. Anyway, that's my long windway of saying. Synist eats are awesome. Uh. And the rate of and uh ambidextran synistats is much higher uh and left handedness than in the general population. Right. So we have some clues here, like, UM, it's it's handedness has to do with how your brain is wired, and if your brain is wired in such a way that you are left handed, your brain is wired differently from a person with a right handed brain. Right, And a lot of studies have backed that up and have come up with things like it's entirely possible that if you're a left handed person you've got some advantages in life. We'll talk about those right after this. So, Chuck, one of the things that UM left handedness possibly bestows confers upon you as a benefit is the idea of thinking quicker, to be able to process information more quickly. Yeah. Uh, they have done some studies on this. UM did did a couple of studies. One of which they sat down on a hundred people, eighty right handers, twenty left handers, and basically to show them a computer screen with a single dot either on the left or the right side, and you had to press a button. It's just a speed test basically like which side is it on? Left or right? Right? So something shows up on the left side. I'm sure you have a clicker in your left hand and clicker in your right hand. You click the left hand clicker. But this is all happening very fast, that's right, UM, and left handed subjects were overall faster. Uh. And the other tests they had to match up multiple letters that appeared in some cases on either side of the line and in other cases on just one side. And again left handed, Uh, we're faster, but just at matching letters that were on both sides of the line, which I thought was interesting well, and that supports this idea that UM the the brain. The fact that UM, some left handed people's motor skills and language centers are on different sides in their brains, UH could make them talk more. The side of their hemispheres of their brains are more connected. There's more white tissue where their corpus colossum is more efficient. It makes sense in a way, but at the same time you're like, wait, that doesn't make any sense. So it's kind of this data should be taken and just locked away in a box until we understand the whole thing more, because it doesn't really do do a lot at this point, we don't know enough to make it fit. And it's actually kind of contradictory to some other stuff too as far as handedness goes. Yeah, but they do say that if you're left handed, you may be like a better gamer or or a pilot because you're able to just process this quick information super fast, like rapid fire stuff coming at you. It also suggested to that language can be processed in both hemispheres among left handed people, which again would require a lot more connections between the two hemispheres, faster communication between the two, and hence quicker thinking. Yeah, and that you in the long run, as you age and your brain deteriorates, you may be in better shape as a lefty because your other hemisphere may be able to pick up that slack more easily, whereas if you're just a dumb right hander, you're just you know, screwed. You're in and of course this has approven. This is just there postulating here, but I mean adds to this mystery. Yeah, you definitely haven't an advantage in sports in a lot of cases though. Yes, but not in the way that you would think. It's not necessarily because your brain is communicating. The hemispheres are of your brain are communicating. It's more because your opponent is statistically likelier to be expecting you to be a right handed person, to have trained against the right handed person exactly, to be used to playing a right handed person. Whereas if you're a left handed person, they're playing you now, you're gonna throw them off guard. You're gonna catch them off guard, you're gonna be able to get the drop on them because they're not used to you, Whereas you, being a lefty, you're still statistically likelier to have played right handed people, so you know how to handle them. They don't know how to handle you. You're the wild card, baby, You win your Rocky. Yeah, Rocky was left handed. Apparently, Um, and there's a bunch of sports figures in real life that we're left handed, and apparently it's one of those things where they're disproportionately represented as far as successful athletes go compared to the to the population at large. Yeah, and I think, um, a lot of times you'll hear about like m M A or boxing. Um. Tennis is another big one because if you're used to playing righties most of your life, that left handed server comes up there and it's it's different, it's weird, right, and the difference is so pronounced that like, if you are a pro tennis player or something like that, or pro boxer, you're gonna train against the lefty before a match against the lefty. Yeah, you know you're gonna do what you can to prepare yourself. Yeah. And I think Robert Lamb wrote this on how staff works are left handers quicker, um so all better at sports and um. He also points out that through history, uh, this probably comes from like soldier training mainly training and fighting and jousting and sword fighting and everything against other rights as well. So a lefty would have a left handed warrior might be more prone to be, you know, the great leader, like perhaps Alexander the Great right who was supposedly left handed. What's weird though, is if that had been the case, if humans have been left handed and right handed, the proportions have been roughly the same for the last two hundred thousand years. If you're a left handed combatant, wouldn't then the proportion of left handed people have grown over time because of natural selection, because you you have an advantage in battle or something like that. So therefore the population of right handed people would drop in relation to the population of exactly. That makes sense, and I remember, but that hasn't happened. Yeah, I remember our podcasts on castles like eighty years ago. Remember they built the staircases going on the right hand side. Do you remember how mine? You don't amendingly difficult that was for me to understand. No, did you have our time with Oh? Yeah, we had to re record it I think really twice because I kept getting it wrong. Yeah. We also got in trouble for for a cussword in that one too. That was a dark day years ago. Um. Yeah, but the Yeah, the the castle steps would wind up on the right side of the wall to give the advantage to the person higher on the stairs swinging a right handed sword, because obviously you couldn't swing a right handed sword going up the stairs because the wall is on your right, But a left handed combatant advantage taken away even though you have the higher ground, because all of a sudden you're cutting the guy's knees off, were cutting them off at the knees. You know that hurts. It does. But also include with natural selection. Two is if there were any real disadvantages to being a left handed person, or there were advantages to being a right handed person, this population shouldn't have remained steady over that long of a period too. I see what you mean. You know, unless the advantage isn't so great as to you know, cause uh, that natural selection to occur. You know, maybe, Um, there are more US presidents that have been left handed, more MENSU members for whatever that's worth. Half half of the twelve US presidents so it's World War two have been left handed. So whereas the normal populations ten to fifteen percent lefties US presidents of World War two has been And apparently in campaign all three candidates H. W. Bush, Clinton, and Pero were left handed. Yeah, that's of the population. Peroh Man, he was fun to watch, he was Dana Carvey was fun to watch doing per to Yeah. Uh. And they say more musicians more or musicians are more likely to be left handed maybe. Um, and it does run in families, even though identical twins can have opposite hand preferences. Oh weird and um there is. In the nineteen eighties, it was a Harvard neurologist that said that, ah, lefties are right eas whose brain centers in the womb change because of high testosterone. Yeah, so there's there's theories that we become handed in the womb because of something like that, or birth trauma or some sort of trauma. While and that. Yeah, it just adjusts the the the construction of our brains. Um. Supposedly, a mother's age has an impact on her kids. That's crazy. Statistically, speaking of a mother, UM over forty who gives birth is has a higher likelihood of having a lefty kid, way higher, like hundred cent or something. Yeah, like that's pretty high. It's more, I don't even know what that means. Yeah, and then I guess your hand preference emerges about by seven months, but then it's like set by age three, So before seven months, you're just flinging poop with both hands equally as well. Pretty much. I wrote a story about a guy who found out as an adult that his mother had suspected he was left handed when he was a baby, so she immobilized his left hand so that he would be forced to learn with his right hand. He didn't seem to take it like that, but he did. It came across like he felt like something had been kind of taken from him. He said. It also explained a lot that he was like so so with stuff that involved its right hand seemed to be better with his left. And um that he looked into it, and that by doing that, which was very popular like kids were forced to become right handed through the twentieth century. Um that you are basically making a a less pronounced copy of the person. You're taking the original and making like a slightly dimmer effect simile of it, like forcing their baying to reorganize like that interesting, whereas they thought they were trying to give them an advantage, to actually give them a disadvantage exactly. But I would imagine that if you did that till say age eighteen, and then all of a sudden started using your dominant hand that you were naturally born with. It's all like spin ley in week right. But then once you once you train it to to to bulk back up, I would imagine your brain would would be better off like that and be fuller. So to continue the abuse right until eighteen dis continued the abuse and then bam, you got a super kid on your take your little old man Spinley, hands and fingers like build them back up? And Mr Show character remember Titanico and they were crossing the hospital. You know they're getting back together. Yeah, yeah, that's exciting.
