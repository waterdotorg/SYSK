Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryan over there, and this is stuff you should know. Not bad. Let's hear yours. I know you can do it. The Soul Train, it's so much higher than that. That was good though, but you you, you dropped it down into your range and it still was. You made it your own, I think, is what I'm trying to say. And I like it, which is old white guy version. So you're not old, You're just middle aged now, okay, sure, uh well let me ask you this, Chuck. Were you aware of Soul Train while it was on? Oh? Yeah, okay, then your super rowl. I love Soul Train. Sure. So I was a solid Gold man myself, but I can get on some Soul Train for sure, especially like vintage stuff these days. Yeah, I mean I've watched Solid Gold to be sure. Uh an American bandstand. But I was just a uh a rapid consumer of popular culture and television and music growing up, so before MTV came along and completely changed my life, because that's all I watched was shows like soul Train. We're where I could because you know, often I couldn't stay up to watch um late night te uh talk shows where you see performances like this is where I got to see live music before I could start go seeing live music. Right, Oh yeah, that was and that was a huge draw of it for sure. Like the idea of just being able to tune in on Saturday at eleven am, depending on where you were and and seeing like a somebody like Marvin Gay or Stevie Wonder perform like that was that was a big deal, especially like you're saying, if you're too young and fell asleep too early to go to a proper show. Um, but even more than that, and like that was a huge, huge mark that Soul Train left was was just presenting that. But that had been done before. There was American band stay and there are all sorts of like kind of dance party TV shows. UM. So it didn't exactly pioneer in that sense. But what it did pioneer and is that the people that was presenting African Americans teenagers um, who were hip and their own people and part of black culture and presenting it in a way that like was an apologetic that wasn't um critical, that didn't didn't portray it in some sort of negative light or in a way that you know, I was trying to get white people to understand it. Just presenting it as it was and celebrating it. That's where Soul Train like really broke through. And it's very very difficult to overstate how revolutionary and groundbreaking Soul Train was, especially for how simple the show format was. Basically, I mean, like you said, bandstand had been around since nineteen two and this uh you know kind of was known as the Black American Bandstand, and it followed that format. It was you know, people, a live music performance, UM, a host interviewing and talking to these people, uh, these musicians afterward briefly, and then beyond that just awesome music spinning on the turntable and amazing dancing, amazing outfits, amazing hairstyles, and just a celebration of black culture. It was really really cool, and um, the point is made in in this uh in this article that they put together for us, but um, it was it was definitely um by black people and four black people, but it was an introduction to black culture to white kids like me, a little eight year old Chuck in Stone Mountain, Georgia sitting around watching the Soul Train dance line. Yeah, I can't imagine it was mind blowing, Chuck, Like, um, I think it wasn't just you know, it wasn't like you were necessarily sheltered where you were growing up. Whether you were or not, it kind of doesn't matter. It was that there there was no place for you to be exposed to this prior to Soul Train, that if you saw a black guy on TV, it was say on the news and he was being arrested for something or they you know, he was involved in a protest and the protest was kind of presented in a particularly negative, agitated light um or he was a sidekick on on TV or a servant or in some kind of goofy comedy or something like that. Like the un soul Training into that, there was no there was no subscribing to all like the preconceived notions that there have been before. It was just its own thing. It was like, hey, by the way we've been you know, we have our own culture over here. You guys have ignored all this time. We're gonna put it on TV and show it off. And if you like it awesome if you don't get lost. Yeah, And Dave um I thought it was kind of astute that he said it was kind of like a lifestyle brand before that was such a thing because these people were influencers, uh what you saw and on soul Train, you you wanted to dance like that, you wanted to wear those clothes. If someone debuted of sweet move, then you saw on Saturday morning, you would uh practice that move in your living room and then debut it at your club that night. And there were like some pretty sweet moves that were debuted on Unsoul Trained. The Sweetest We did an entire episode on the Moonwalk, if you remember correctly, and that was originally called the Backslide that was created on Soul Train. The Robot the rerun. Dam it, man, there's so much sweet robot ing. Yes, yeah, and that's where he came from. Apparently no one did the robot And like these were like basically club kids who who now had a place to do their club stuff on TV and then go out to the club's later that night and do some more and like come up with more stuff and they come bring it to Soul Train again and then kids would watch that kids, college kids, adults would watch this and be like, this is the coolest thing that's on TV right now, and I want to do those dance moves too. Yeah. Let's read a couple of these quotes that kind of encapsulate how important of a show this was. One is from philosopher, activists and Harvard professor Cornell West. He said, I never missed it Saturday morning as a graduate, as a student at Princeton, I would see it wherever I was. It made available to the world one of the great traditions in American history, which is a history of soul music. Soul music at its best, taught America, especially young Americans, about color, how to be free, and how to love in a deeper and better way. Uh. And this from common the actor and rapper. Watching my babysitter get the opportunity to go on Soul Train was like a dream come true for her because Soul Train was the biggest thing then for the black community. It gave ordinary, everyday people an opportunity to express themselves. It showed us that we two have a place on TV. Yeah, and I can't imagine what commons babysitter, how excited she must have been to get to be on Soul Train, like that must have been the biggest thing possible, Like they said it was the hippest trip on television, and like that was not much of an exaggeration, especially at the time, especially when you compared it to like American Bandstand at the time, which when when Soul Train came along, you said Bandstand had been on since nineteen fifty two, almost two decades by this time. Um Soul Train comes along, And there was a TV critic in nineteen seventy three who wrote, I believe for the New York Times that comparing Um Soul Train to the old American Bandstand is like comparing Champagne to seltzer Burns. That had to that had to hurt Dick Clark. Oh, he did fun well as far as I could tell. Everything I've ever heard about him. He was literate, so we very well could have read that, and if not, somebody may have read it to him and it hurt his feelings. There's no way it didn't. So we can't talk about Soul Train without talking about Don Cornelius. Uh. Don Cornelius was the host and creator of Soul Train and owner and Owner, which is huge, like this guy owned his own TV show, which was not a very common thing to happen, still a comment thing. They usually put him in league with Desi ar Nez, who owned I Love Lucy, and Mike Douglas who owned the Mike Douglas Show. Most of even like the creators of a show, you didn't own the show that you created, like you like have some sort of deal with somebody to help produce it, or a network has exclusive rights to it, or somebody else at least own some other piece of it. This was a hundred percent Don Cornelius's jam And there's a legend um that kind of goes along with that that James Brown came on very early on in like nineteen seventy two or three, and he was like, so, who's backing you on this? Man and dot thank you. I can't do a very good James Brown um, and Don Cornelius says, it's just me James. And apparently James Brown thought that he didn't fully understand the question, so he kind of asked it again, didn't think to rephrase it in different words, just asked the same question. Don Cornelius answers in the same way He says, it's just me. James, like he got what he's saying, and he was telling him this is mine, a percent mine. Nobody else owns it. It's totally my show. And I don't think anybody else could have done it like Don Cornelius did. He was perfect for Soul Train, and I think the reason why is because it came from him, like it was his creation and his baby. Should we take a break, I'm a little worked up, so yeah maybe so all right, Uh, you're gonna work on your rerun dance. We're gonna take a little break and we'll go back and uh talk about young Don Cornelius right after this. I want to learn about how to take a perfect but about kiscon murders that they kind of all runs on the plane every day. We should know warred up Jerry. Alright, So Young Don was born in Chicago on the South Side, in the neighborhood of Bronzeville, known as the Black Metropolis. He was the son of a postal worker and it was a marine. He joined the Marines after high school. Uh fought in South Korea. After that, comes home to Chicago, tells cars for a little while, sells insurance for a little while and then says, I want to be a cop. I want to be a popo. Yep, And he was a popo also in there somewhere. He married, I believe, his high school sweetheart and has two kids. So by the time he's a cop, he's he's married with with two kids at home, two sons and one day. Um, there's a story and urban legend, as far as I know, is true. Let me smell it. Well, then it's not an urban legend. It's just a story. It could be a true urban legend. We're gonna come up with an entirely different category right now, Chuck. So Don Cornelius, Officer Cornelius pulls the guy over, and that guy happened to be the news director, Roy Wood for a local UM a M radio station, w v O N. And as Roy Wood is getting this ticket written up by Officer Cornelius, he's like, hey man, your voice is astounding, because if you've never heard Don Cornelius's voice, press pause right now and go on to YouTube. Just listen to some soul train intros from him. He was an amazingly hip cat with one of the best voices of all time. Ry white. He also pulled over the guy and said license and registration. Baby, Yeah, so that helped. Yeah, do it as Sammy Davis Jr. Pulling him over. Now, hey bad, give me your license and registration. That was that was so good? So um, anyway, the guy like is like, you have a really great voice. Have you ever considered going into radio? And Don Cornelius says, I haven't until now, but I'm going to give it some thought. And not only does he give it some thought, it's not clear whether he actually gave Roy Wood the ticket or not. Um, but he actually quits being a cop, goes and takes a three month broadcasting course with a wife and two sons at home, so this is a pretty big risk on his part, and tries out for a part as a radio announcer at w v WIN and gets hired after a three month course because his voice was that great and because his persona was that hip too. So yes, Don Cornelius, Uh, the voice of gold the Golden Tonsils? Is that what they called the velvet fog? That was melt? Or may? Okay? I always get this too confused and nol on movie Crush. His nickname is Smokey vellet. Oh that's nice. I'm not sure where that came from. Maybe I made it up. Smokey gullet, smokey velfit. I was smokey vell smokey gullet. That's really gross. So uh. He becomes a DJ at the radio station, like you said, and then as hired as a reporter, a news reporter on TV for w c i U t V. He covered sports, he covered covered civil rights stuff. He had a show for the news program called a Black's View of the News, which is, you know something you could only get away with in the nineteen sixties, I think early seventies. Plant. Oh, yeah, you're right, it would have been the sixties. Sorry, yeah, and he u. He interviewed Jesse Jackson, he interviewed Martin Luther King. Uh. Still djaying at night, and he hosted the series of house parties and club appearances all over Chicago. And he would take the train to get to these places. So he called these parties the soul Train. That's where the name came from. Yeah, so he's like a TV broadcaster by day, radio radio DJ and sock hop DJ by night comes up with this soul train idea. And again, so this is like in his first year after taking a three month broadcasting course, after pulling over a radio executive who told him he had a good voice, and he's like, you know what, I'm happy doing news and civil rights reporting and I'm part of you know, this group called the Good Guys, these black DJs out of Chicago that were kind of known as the arbiters of cool. But um, he he said that he had He later said he had this burning desire to um to see black people depicted on television in a positive light. And he decided that the best way to do that was to kind of take these parties, these sock hops and um just kind of cool Chicago house parties that he was djaying, and just put him on TV. That like that would basically be enough that if people just saw how cool these parties weren't, how fun they weren't, how much like how how what a celebration of like black culture they were just in and of themselves, that that could be a TV show by itself, And that was the original soul train. That's right and very key. He went to his TV station w c i U and said, I want to shoot a pilot for this thing, baby, and they said, Uh, sure, but we're not gonna be front the money, and he said, I'll pay for it. Little did he know what a fortuitous move that was, because I think had they funded it, they would have had a real claim to it legally. But he put up four hundred bucks of his own money shot a pilot. It didn't look that great, it was in black and white, but it was a big hit immediately. Uh, And he said, not because it was wonderful, but because it was theirs. It belonged to the black people. A year later, he moves to l a and said, I'm gonna do the show for real here. This is where it became nationally syndicated, which you know, I don't know when we talked about TV syndication, but that's basically when it's not owned and run on a major network, but you sell it to each local TV uh station in whatever city. Yeah. I don't know what we would have talked about that on either, but um I would. I think we should do an entire episode on TV syndication. I'll bet it was world changing. So um when he moved to Los Angeles, that Black and White Soul Train it used to be on every weekday. They continued that, so it was like it was two things. It was a full color, nationally syndicated television show out of l A. But it was also a black and white local weekly um or weekday television show out of Chicago at the same time. For like a good five years, they were both running at the same time, and so Don Cornelius was at the helm of both. So on Fridays he would fly out to l A shoot four episodes two on Saturday to on Sunday, and then fly back in time to be there for the afternoon black and white Monday episode of the Chicago local Soul Train Amazing, Working Hard was working Hard, Yeah, it's right. So uh. It was a very popular show right out of the gate, but advertising was always kind of a struggle because mainstream brands didn't quite know what to make of it. They didn't this was kind of the first show of its kind. Um. But that did open the door for Johnson Products, another black owned Chicago business from husband and wife team George and Joanne Johnson. Uh that they started nineteen fifty four, and these commercials are so great too. They sold beauty and hair care products to African Americans, so Afro Sheen and Ultra Sheen were the two big ones and the two big commercials you see, and they became as much as part of the fabric of the show almost as like the Soul Train line or the performers or anything else. Really yeah, and I mean, like I think in a large part because they were they were like our stamps dot com, like one of the earliest and longest running sponsors. Right, So when they came on, what they were promoting with like with Afro Sheen and Ultra Sheen was radical and that it's saying like just let your hair grow naturally. These are hair products for African Americans to use when they're growing their hair naturally, not following like white beauty standards. Right. So it was like a perfect sponsor for Soul Train, which is a celebration of black culture. Um for itself, the the um Johnson family of products were promoting black culture and it's in like natural state too, So it was like just perfect to go hand in hand. I think they kind of worked with each other, but also we're important independent of one another, but when you put them together, it was like greater than some of its parts even. Yeah, and it was um it was a big deal culturally. Uh. Not only was it a big hit, but like people like Jesse Jackson said, Don Cornelius is right up there with any civil rights leader of our generation. He gave people a chance to feel good about themselves. That's pretty great. Uh. And like I said, I was a little white kid watching it. There's this lady, Madeline Weeks, who was a fashion editor at g Q. She was a little white girl in Virginia, and she said, I watched Soul Train religiously every week. I loved it from beginning to end. Even the Afrochine and ultrachine ads were heaven. I had the funkiest, most stylish, sexiest dancers. Everybody looked like they were having the best time. All the girls look gorgeous. Who wouldn't want to look like that. I was just a little kid living in the countryside in Virginia and I live for it. Does something else, it's pretty great. Well, you want to take a break and then get back into what it was like to watch Soul Train and be on it. You know. I was a guest. Yes, I can't wait. We're gonna debut that clip live, all right, let's do it. I want to learn about a terris ortic college actol how to take a perfect moment, all about fractal An kiscon that the hun the Lizzie Border murders, that they kind of all runs on the plane, everything that we should know. Wear it up, Jerry, Okay, Chuck, So we're back. There was one little thing that I wanted to include about w c i U, the original Chicago home of Soul Train. Apparently it was like a ragtag UHF station, an independent station, and um, have you ever seen that that movie UHF with weird al Nope, it's so good, but it actually is not too far off from w c i U. They would play Lithuanian and Polish language talk shows Amos and Andy, um, bullfights from Mexico like these. They just had this weird assemblage of TV shows. But then they're they're in house. Programming was made by like this ragtag kind of group of inexperienced people. And there's I read in the Chicago Reader this kind of oral history of the local version of Soul Train. The head cameraman at w c i U had strabusmus and couldn't use the viewfinder in the camera. It was like that kind of rag tag group that just kind of got it done somehow. I just love that little tidbit. That's pretty cool. Alright. So if you watch Soul Train, the first thing that you would see when the show starts is that classic um animated intro of that freight train rolling into the city. So cool, so iconic. Then you see Don Cornelius, always dressed to the nines, the coolest cat maybe to ever be on television. Would make Billy d weep with jealousy. He was because he was a DJ previously he was. He just had that DJ lingo down, you know. Uh, day put in one of the things. It's going to be a stone gas honey, like all that seventies um sort of shaft like talk was is just who Don Cornelius was. Let me, let me try my hand at it. You ready, Okay, it's gonna be a stone gas honey. Okay, that sounded like a CB trucker from the seventies. Somehow, it's gonna be a stone gas honey. I don't know what my problem is. Hey, not bad, don't MIHI to meet Chuck Josh Cornelius. Uh, you had the ear musical guests, like we said, just like American band stand. Um, I think sometimes they lip lip SYNCD and sometimes they really sang. Early on they lip synced across the board. Yeah, it kind of depends on who the artist is too, Um, Patti LaBelle, Barry White, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Al Green, like just a murderers row of rhythm and blues and soul performers. I think Gladys Knight and the Pips was on the first syndicated episode. Yeah, and like that was a huge favor that he called in and Gladys totally delivered by being on that first nationally syndicated episode because it drew a lot of attention and apparently from that point on, uh, he was he was always very um deferential, saying, you know, if it weren't for Gladys, none of this would be here right now. That's nice. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Her. Have you ever eaten at Gladys Knight's House of Chicken and Waffles? What do you think? I'm thinking you probably have multiple times, but we've never discussed it. Yeah. I mean when I lived in l A, I was a regular at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. But um, yeah, Gladys Knight does it right as well, Yes she does. Have you ever had the smothered chicken there? I don't think so. Is it like gravy or something? Yes? And it is even better than the chicken and waffles. Yes. I can't not get the chicken and waffles. So get both, Okay, just get both. There's no reason to hold back at Gladys Knight's house of chicken and waffles and eat a little bit of both and take the rest of them sure, or eat it all? Yes, um so Soul Train. Of course, the musical performances were great and classic and iconic, but it's the dancing that is what it's really known for. They got they scouted out some of these dancers. They would go to the clubs and they did this on American Bandstand and other shows too that had that had dancers. They would go find like the flies dancers in the clubs, invite them to be on the show, and everyone else had to audition, Like thousands of people would line up an audition with their dance moves to be a Soul trained dancer. Yeah and um like again, like commons babysitter was saying, like that was a big deal to be picked, and some were recruited, like you're saying, from the clubs um, and those those particular dancers were usually so good that they would rise to like national prominence, like the camera just couldn't avoid them. They also were no slouches that learning how to play to the camera to um when the camera was on them or anywhere near them. Um. But one of the ways that everybody shine to whether you've got a lot of camera time or not, was in the the the Soul Train Line, which became a really regular feature of each episode where everybody just kind of be clapping and standing on two sides, and then a couple would come down, usually a couple, sometimes it was solo would come down and do some crazy dance moves, um and really get a chance to like show off and and kind of capture the attention of the of the viewing audience. Yeah, if you've never gone on YouTube and looked at Soul Train Line videos, um, first of all, I'm surprised that you you exist as a human. And secondly, just do it and then look up at the clock two hours later, because you will be able to do nothing but watch those video clips. It's amazing and what's cool about it too, is you can put it to any kind of super cool music and it sounds really great. It looks really great. What you like and mute it and put on different music. No, no, but other people have like put their own tracks or other people's tracks. Video of soul Train. It works really well. Interesting. Yeah, I like the real music. Sure, real music isn't bad either. The jungle boogie one is really good. In particular, that is a good one. So they filmed four episodes in a weekend. Um. Apparently the dancers were worked pretty hard, and Cornelius was pretty demanding of them. You couldn't choot, gum, you couldn't curse. His mantra was beyond time, be tactful, be creative, be funky, and be yourself. Yeah, they were unpaid too, typically, Um, I guess you would be paid if you were dancing to a performer. Um, but if you were part of the segments that that it was just them playing music and people were dancing, you were unpaid. Um. I think they'd feed you because again, you're doing two episodes over two days, so for total, like you were saying, um, and I mean you're dancing like the whole time, and I'm guessing that these things probably took longer than an hour. They didn't just do an hour and that was it, with no retakes or edits or anything like that. So I'm not sure how long it actually took to film an actual episode, but you were basically dancing the entire time, two episodes back to back, twice over a weekend. I bet it was fun too, though I'm sure it was fun too. I was thinking the impression that it was a little competitive. Although there's a guy who um frequently gets overshadowed by Don Cornelius, but was known as his right hand man. His name was Clinton Ghent, and he was one of the uh the kind of co creators of soul Train, or he was there from the beginning in Chicago, and he had a real eye for finding those dancers in the clubs. He was one of the ones who would go scout dancers, um but not only of finding people who had like really crazy good moves and getting them to come on to soul Train, but of putting all sorts of different dancers who would normally be pretty competitive with one another, finding groups that would kind of jell together like a family. So that when you go back and watch Soul Train episodes or when you were watching it when they were coming on the first time, you you you weren't like sitting there seeing like dancers like kind of sniping one another, backbiting or pushing each other out the way. It did kind of have this really family vibe every episode, And apparently that was the work of Clinton Gent guy who who just really knew how to put people together. Yeah, that g Q uh editor really nailed it. Like it It just looked like every it looked like a party you wanted to be at, like everyone was having a good time. Yeah, for sure. So some of the um, some of these dancers went on to be famous. Um, we're kind of discovered there. Jody Whatley, the singer, She started out as a teenager on Soul Train, and Don Cornelius was like, you're super talented. I'm a businessman. Um, I'm gonna pair you with this other guy, Jeffrey Daniel, and you guys should record music together. And that little group went on to be Shalimar of course. Uh in nineteen seventy seven they got together and then after Shalimar, Jody Watley went on to become Jody Watley. That's right. Ah, you mentioned rerun from What's Happening, Um, Nick Cannon Carmen Electra, which I didn't know that she started out there that that kind of surprised me. I didn't either. Her real name is Tera Lee Patrick. Did you know that. I don't know if I did or not. I know it wasn't Carmen Electra. Yeah, it's not that, although she looks way more like a Carmen Electra than a Terry Lee Patrick. Yeah, agreed, didn't look at all Irish or Southern. Rosie Perez was maybe one of the biggest names to come out of a Soul Train. This was in the eighties, because you know, you think about the salad days of Soul Train and you'd probably think of the seventies, but the eighties were pretty big and it went all the way to two thousand six. But um, in the eighties is when the hip hop influence came on, and Rosie Perez brought that that Brooklyn, New York City hip hop flavor. And if you go back and watch some of her stuff fun Soul Train, it's like the Dancing School. It's much it's much different than that sort of seventies groove that was. It was that sort of New York City hip hop style. Yeah, but she does it like the beginning of um, what does it, uh, do the right thing? Yeah, that's her dancing at the beginning of her right. Yeah. That was like straight up soul train. That's what she did on soul Train um, which is very much not like what they were doing in l A too. So she kind of rose to prominence as a soul train dancer very quickly, and Don Cornelius apparently was like, hey, I want to lock you into a contract, and Rosie Perez, being smart, streetwise, Rosie Perez said that's great, I'll show it to my lawyer. And apparently Don Cornelius didn't like this, and as the story goes, he grabbed Rosie Perez, which is not what you do when somebody says that they want their lawyer to look at a contract, you want them to lock into um or for any reason really um And to get him all of her she threw um a piece of the fried chicken she was eating at the time, right at his head and hit him in the face. That's how the story goes. That's how Rosie Perez tells it for sure. Yeah, and you know we should mention too that that is not cool at all. And while we're praising Don Cornelius for his talents as a host, he uh he did later in life when he was a bit older. Um was what was he arrested or was he just charged? I think he was charged with um domestic violence against his Russian Ukrainian wife. Yes, he was at least charged. Um. I don't know if he was convicted, but there was a Yeah, he got into an entailment because of that, at least accusation that he had um abused her and then also apparently intimidated a witness into changing their story. He was charged with that as well. It was from what I understand though, this all took place over a single night and possibly within a very short period of time, over single night. Not at all trying to justify or excuse it, but um, I don't. I don't know the story behind it at all, um, but I think it's worth pointing out like Don Cornelius was not just as straight up like nothing but a smooth, cool cat. He was a complex human being who had faults as well too, and flaws and all that. I mean grabbing Rosie Perez is bad enough alone. Sure you know what you get, You get the old chicken wing to the forehead. Yeah you do. I you would think, like even before she was a star, you'd know, just hanging out with her a little bit, not to mess with Rosie Perez. I would never mess with Rosie Perez. And he didn't know that his signature sign off was on Don Cornelius and as always imparting, we wish you love, peace and soul. Yeah. There are a couple of other people who kind of rose to prominence to Cheryl Song. She was the first Asian dancer on Soul Train, and she said she had to really kind of prove herself that she wasn't just like the token non African American dancer, UM, that she was actually a really good dancer, and she did um. And then Jermaine Stewart, who you might recognize as the singer of We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off. And that's pretty cute because he came back home and performed it on Soul Train in and when Don Cornelius was introducing him, he was saying, he made good and we're all very proud of him, and like you mentioned the Irish Carmon Electra, who I guess stood out because she was river dancing on Soul Train, and everyone was like, what is that? What is that? But then everybody wanted to do it because it was Carmon Electra doing it. So Soul Train was so popular, and Dick Clark, I guess, didn't feel like he had enough money as a TV mogul and an icon on American Bandstand, so he went, Hey, I'm gonna start my own Soul Train and try and bury Don Cornelius all right, and I'm gonna call it Soul Unlimited. M gonna put it on ABC. And it was. You can see clips of it on YouTube. It didn't last long, but it was a literal rip off of Soul Train. And you might say Soul Train was a rip off of American band Stand fair enough, but for him to go after, uh, the African American market like that, I don't think it was very cool. No, it isn't very cool. I could see Dick Clark being a little blind to the larger implications of it. And you know, I don't know if if he was involved in it's canceling or not, but you know, some some black leaders did get it canceled. They started a campaign to say, like, no, just leave this one alone. I don't know if how easily Dick Clark went along with it or not. I like to think he was like, okay, I see the air of my ways now and dropped it. But yeah, only a few episodes came out either way. Soul Train was left to like stand on its own, you know which? And I think rightfully so too. Yeah yeah, uh. There were other performers later on, they would have white performers. David Bowie very famously was on there. Did you watch that? Did? It? Was awful? Did a pretty bad lip sync job, which Cornelius gave him, uh, kind of teased him about. Uh. And then Elton John who was who has always had a pretty big following in the African American community. I don't know that, did you? Yeah? Yeah? He wrote. He wrote about it in his autobiography that I read last year. I think it started when um Aretha Franklin covered Burned Down the Mission If I'm not mistaken, Okay, is that the one she recorded? I think that's the way it went down. I've never heard of that song before. What is wrong with you? You've never heard burned Down the Mission? I don't think so. I'm not the biggest Elton John fan. I mean, I'm fine with him, but I really don't like a lot of his seventies stuff, like a lot. I really don't like it. Wow, But I like is any stuff like the whole I'm Still Standing thing? It was burned down the mission before that? Yeah? Yeah, that was That was my follow up question is what what what problem did he have with the mission? He didn't write it? Okay, Bernie taup and wrote all his lyrics. Oh I now I am a Bernie toppin You're a National treasure. Thank you. So Elton John was on a couple of times, and um, it's pretty sweet if you look at the one. I'm not sure if it was the Philadelphia Freedom one or I hate that song or the other one that's such a good song, but he would they you know, he takes questions and you can tell he's kind of shy and a little nervous, and he takes some questions from the from the people, from the dancers and stuff, which was kind of cool. But it's just very sweet to see how nervous he was. Yeah, because he's he's known for being a humble, humble spirit, is he. No, have you ever seen that the documentary they made or he self made, or no, his partner made. His partner was the only one he would, let you know, fallo him around with the camera, which is pretty understandable. But he came out in the last like I don't know, decade or less. Yeah, the tantrums and tiarros. I think, yes, yeah, yeah, Yeah, it was great man. I loved it. Yeah, he's good. I like that Rocketman movie a lot too. I have not seen that. I saw it. I saw it over someone else's shoulders on a plane. You wouldn't like it, I didn't. I know. It didn't look like anything I would like. No, if you don't like Elton John, you wouldn't like the movie about Elton John. No. And again, sir Elton, I have no problem with you personally. It's just that that period through seventies, the seventies like Crocodile Rock, Um, the one about like Philadelphia Freedom, Um. You know all those bad seventies albums Madman Across the Water and Captain Fantastic and Goodbye ell Bick Road. Those are all terrible, exactly I feel understood. Check think you. Uh So, the eighties come along and Don Cornelius has brain surgery, takes a little time off, he comes back, Soul Train is has changed their look a little bit to try and fit with um kind of what's going on at the time with like Whitney Houston and people like that. And then hip hop and rap come along and apparently Don Cornelia Cornelius was not a big fan. Uh yeah, And I think I read I can't remember. I read a really great article and dazed about it. Or there's another pretty good one that was a review of the recent TV biopic about him and Soul Train on The Guardian, and it basically explained it like that Don Cornelius was like a mid century integration minded black businessman and that he and his ilk in generation they had been working towards like, you know, getting a piece of the pie that didn't necessarily it wasn't the white pie. It was the pie that white people controlled. And if you were you know, if you if you made your way to get a piece of this that like you could you could be black and still enjoy the good life. And that hip hop reminded him of everything that he and his generation had kind of tried to work beyond and past and integrate um and that to him it was a step backwards. So he wasn't vibing on it at all. My own personal take is that he was a smooth customer and he appreciated smoothness, and hip hop, especially eighties hip hop, was the opposite of smooth, and so he was not vibing on it at all. And he even referred to himself as an old guy sometimes when he was interviewing, Um, you know some of the hip hop artists who came on Soul Train in the eighties. Yeah, I watched one of the Public Enemy clips and um, it was weird. Afterwards he like, he basically ignores Chuck D and like talks only to Flavor Flavor and then finally turns to Chuck. It was like, and now, Chuck D. He said, you must feel so blessed to have have someone as talented as Flavor as your partner. What really, it was really weird, and Chuck D was like, yeah, you know, he's quite a character, as you can see. I just I don't know. It really came off as like Don Cornelius, it doesn't understand this I'm not dissing flav but like Chuck D was like the he was the leader of that band, you know, Yeah, he was the brains behind the outfit for sure. And I mean, like, yeah, Flavor Flavors just like he's he's like fills in the kind of hardness of Chuck D. Yeah, I I don't. Yeah, if you think public Enemy, it's definitely Flavor Flavor and Chuck T. But it's Chuck T. Yeah, you know what I mean, and then Flavor flav. Yeah. It was definitely a strange interview because I thought, finally he's going to talk to Chuck T. And he's like, you must feel so good about having this guy as your partner, which which one was that after? Because they were on at least twice on the regular show by my account, and then once on the Soul Train Awards at least, So it's not like he wasn't smart enough to know that they were big and should be on anyway, whether he liked him or not. But they did. They did Can't Trust It In and they did Bubble without a pause in seven and I could not find the interview segment. I just saw like the performance and we both like really great. Well, it was very sweet and actually, um, it would have had to be in the nineties one because afterward Flavor Flav asked for a a moment of silence for the passing of Miles Davison Red Fox, and they took a moment of silence. That's awesome. So um and that's actually just um, in case we haven't gotten this across enough yet, Soul Train again, was it never got away from like it's black roots, like it never sold out or anything like that. Like it was like, that makes perfect sense that they would include that part. They wouldn't just edit that out in the episode that they were published. Um, that was just part of it. Even as they're as late as the early nineties. Yeah, and the early nineties is when done Cornelius finally had to step down. Was his final episode Old. He passed it on to the younger generation. It went all the way to two thousand six and became the longest running syndicated show in TV history. Yeah, thirty five season amazing and it's that those younger that younger generation that he handed the reins over to. Some of the temporary hosts included Jamie Fox got his start, Tira Banks and Shamar More from Criminal Minds. He was a long time stand in host. Yeah, he's a big time now. I don't know who that is. Um. I I don't watch Criminal Minds either, but you've seen enough like ads for Criminal Minds that you would recognize. I'm sure very sadly done. Cornelius took his own life. He was suffering from Alzheimer's and apparently was having a lot of seizures and just in a pretty bad way, um physically, and his son said that that was that was the reason why he took his own life. Yeah. Well Pussy had also sold the rights I think too Soul two, and it seems like things kind of started to go downhill for him around then, I think in two thousand eight. Um. But yeah, apparently it was a really big surprise to everybody who knew him that he um, he died by suicide, that that was not the perceived outcome for him, I think, Um, But his legacy lives on. Like you said, I mean, the thirty five seasons the longest running syndicated television show of all time. In and of itself, it's an incredible achievement, but also to be like a cornerstone of like introducing black culture as black culture to the larger culture as a whole and white culture is yeah. I mean that's that's about as big an accomplishment as as you can make. It's like Jesse Jackson said he was as important as any civil rights leader, you know. So that's Don Cornelius and so trained. That's if you want to know more about you don't need to know anything else. Just start go watching clips of Soul Train and you will be a happier person than you were before you started. Get ready for some sick robot action. It's so great. And rerun too. You can't forget about re run fred Berry. No, that's sweet. Um, well, since we talked about fred Berry, that means everybody obviously it's time for a listener mail. Uh, this is about Iron Maiden. Hey, guys, listen to your short stuff on six six six and loved it more so for Josh's thoughts on Iron Maiden, hardest working band in business seeing them twice. I've been a Maiden fan for about fifteen years, and I gotta say Josh was right on the money when he said Power Slave was the album to listen to if you've never really given them a chance, So chuck, whip out that old bean bag, roll up a fatty, crack open a cold one, and crank up some Maiden.
