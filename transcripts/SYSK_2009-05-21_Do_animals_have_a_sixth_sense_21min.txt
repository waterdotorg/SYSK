Join Josh and Chuck, the guys who bring you Stuff you Should Know, as they take a trip around the world to help you get smarter in a topsy turv economy. Check out the all new super Stuffed Guide to the Economy from how Stuff Works dot Com, available now exclusively on iTunes. Hey, and welcome to the podcast Whoop Whoop. That's the side of the police. I'm Josh Clark, Chuck Bryant's with me. Boogie Down Productions, Old school rap. That's right, took nice one, good call. I love it. Yeah. So um, how are you doing. I'm well, sir, Yeah, I'm doing really well. Chuck. Yeah, thank you for asking. Thanks. Do it look healthy from the from the nose up, I've noticed that my base is becoming increasingly resemblant to a catcher's mit, an old catcher's met and not a compass, no, like a very round catchers it a perfectly round catcher man. How about that, like one of those catchers mits from like the early days. Maybe my full name could be compass head catcherst it's a little cumbersome. So, Chuck, have you ever met a cat? I've got two cats, so you have? Oh yeah, you've got the Whiz and Lebron. That's pretty close. Actually, I'm impressed the Wizard and Laurn Lauren. Okay, yeah, I just added a b right, and I would not name my cat after Lebron James currently killing the Atlanta Hawks. Yeah, he's good though, and a good guy here. Yeah. Sure, so, Chuck, have you ever met a cat that could predict death? No? But I love this story. It's a good one. Do you mean the story of Oscar? Yeah? I remember what happened. Oh really? Oh yeah, I remember reading about it. I've got to pay more attention. Yeah. My wife and I share these animal stories with each other, gotcha. Okay, like Christian the lion who was taken to Kenyan the seventies, don't think there was not a tear or two shed? And I agreed Brian Alsehold, especially the one, the version of it that was put to Aerosmith's Um. I don't want to uh, don't want to miss a thing. Don't want to miss a thing? Yes, exactly, nice Chuck, Okay, well. Back in two thousand seven, the New England Journal of Medicine, which is not exactly known for its sensational journalism UM published a story about a cat named Oscar. And Oscar was a resident at a Rhode Island nursing home, Yeah, the Steerhouse Nursing and Rehab Center. And basically he was just a normal cat. Aloof kind of was like, Hey, you're old and I'm staying away from you. For the most part. It was a home. It is a home for people with advanced dementia, and I get the impression that it has a bit of a hospice vibe to it here there um so Oscar, as I said, it's generally aloof except when you're about to die all of a sudden. If you're laying in bed and Oscar comes over to you and sits down next to your bed and starts hanging out with you, you got a couple of hours left. And uh, Oscar is actually pretty good at predicting death. Uh, there's at least twenty five cases where he accurately predicted the death of a person in the Steer Nursing Home and Josher's there was a rumor there is a rumor on the internet going around that Oscar met an untimely death and there was a mysterious dented bedpan found near his lifeless cat body. Not so, because we just called. We called the Steer Nursing Home to find out there were there were It was kind of vague. There were a couple of reputable news sources e g. The Savannah Morning News that carried that story, but they all appeared to be the same. So Chuck and I, being the internet sluice that we are, just picked up the phone and did it the old fashioned way, and we called the nursing home. And Oscar is still alive and well and in the nursing home, apparently predicting death as well. Right, although she said that she was she was looking at Oscar. I wonder if she met Oscar's stuffed body on the counter of the check in on that floor. But how hilarious is that that Oscar would be murdered because patients didn't like him predicting their deaths anymore. So not true. Oscars alive and well. I must say when I said my wife and I really loved the story. We didn't see it as a as a maccab predictor of death kind of thing. Like Josh Bannett, we saw it as a comforting thing that an animal provides. Was trying to comfort these people. So that's the way I took it. Is it? There are other theories? Okay? Alright, so Chuck, how could a cat possibly predict death? Right? They can smell it? Perhaps smelling is probably the likeliest answer. Yes. You know, when you're sick, like when you have the flu, you don't smell quite right, you know what I mean? You smell sick like your breath is messed up, there's some gunk coming out of your pores. I when I was sick over the course of the last like eight podcast, UM, I was waking up with literally my eyelids pasted shut from gunk that was coming out. And don't think that didn't smell, pal You want to know more swine flu? I want to get back to the cats smelling death? Okay, So smelling is a pretty obvious way. Apparently, as UM people's organs begin to shut down or fail. Uh that there's the hypothesis that, um, this would omit certain smells, certain chemicals that humans cannot smell. What's that called? When a cell commits suicide. Uh sellicide at auto license r mortist baby. Um, so okay, the I guess the the the senses that as these cells begin to cannibalize themselves and break down and all their contents are at least it starts to admit a smell that might attract Oscar. Right. But the cool thing is, as you said, uh, he it's not like he just goes in points like this, one's next and then leaves. He hangs out until the person is dead and then he leaves. Yeah, that's that's what I took. Is that's the comforting part to me, and comforting or you know, you wonder if you could get the cat that lead you've got a second chance or something not true at all. I wonder if people have ever tried to bargain with the cat, like, dude, I'll totally get you more friskies if you just get out of here, or if one of the people in the home that didn't like one of the other people left a little trail of kibble, yeah, just to screw with the their fellow patient nursing home hygiene. It makes you wonder, Chuck, is it possible that Oscar the cat is in fact the Grim Reaper. Uh, he is not Josh. But that's just one example of what we're talking about, which is animals having a sixth sense. Oh what a sixth CeNSE? Well said Chuck. You we already decided that Chuck was going to say six cents and not me because I can't say yeah, thanks for the impression of each other. I have a speech impediment, it turns out. So, uh, should we talk about dogs next? Well? Yeah, one of the one of the things that's fascinating about oscars. Cats aren't They're not they don't do that. They're not empathetic, they're not supposed to do that. They're not known for being dogs are right, Um? Dogs tend to be very happy, loving creatures, and so it would make more sense if Oscar was a dog. Sure, because dogs there's all kinds of anecdotal stories, uh about dogs detecting cancer by smelling, and not just anecdotal. My friend, well, Mr Stack guy, I happen to have a study right here, you're killing me. I have a two thousand six study right um, And I have no idea where it's from, but it seems a little shaky to me quite too. It's from Science Daily pal. They don't printice anything. UM. It was a two thousand six study where they took eight six patients with cancer with lung cancer and thirty one with breast cancer and these were confirmed cancer cases. And then they used a control sample of eighty three healthy people, right, And they actually took breath samples from these people and and seal them in special tubes, and then they exposed them to these dogs. They had dog sniff the different samples and UM with a eight to seven percent UM accuracy. Thank you. Uh, these dogs could pick out people with cancer. Really wow. So clearly there's some smells that we humans aren't aware of, aren't cognizant of, you know, because we like to smoke and eat cheeseburgers and things like that. UM, that that animals can sense, which would explain why you could detect cancer. And there's another study that showed that UM dogs could detect bladder cancer in urine. So there you have that one to thank you, and uh that you know that makes sense to me because animals certainly have different hearing capacities than we do. UM. High pitched sounds like dog whistles, we can't hear humans typically here between twenty and twenty thousand hurts. And elephants too can hear between sixteen and twelve thousand, and cattle can go all the way up to forty thou And so that's why when animals are said to predict weather and earthquakes and things like that, that and bear barometric pressure changes. They pick up on these things when humans don't. So it's not exactly that they have a sixth sense, but they used the five senses are more heightened than humans are. That's interesting that you say cattle can hear better than anybody else. What was that? Well, because I was reading in this article it mentions the two four tsunami and how there were so few animal carcasses found because so many animals acted strangely and basically headed to higher ground before the tsunami hit. The animals that they found the most of her cattle. So maybe they know and they're just like, I don't have a whole lot to live for, I'm just gonna let death take me now. Or maybe they, you know, had a harder time getting out of there than heading the higher crown. I don't know. Yeah, that's just one theory. So okay, So Oscar maybe in the league of his own by predicting death. But yeah, there there is tons of anecdotal evidence that animals, um especially dag can sense illness. Right. Um, there was there was a chihuahua that a woman in England owned. Who um said that her dog detected a breast cancer. I thought you're gonna say, taco bell, No awful. It was a detective breast cancer three different times in her which sucks. She had breast cancer three different times. Better chihuahua was like, you got breast cancer? Hunt? Interesting? And uh. There was a person with a Dalmatian. I don't know where he or she was from, but um, the dalmatian kept smelling this freckle on the on the owner's arm and it turned out skin cancer. Isn't that weird? I believe it? Man? Why not? Like I always say, why not? I mean, what do we know as humans? I mean, who knows? Maybe animals can totally smell these things. Should we go to epilepsy? I think we should. I think we totally should. This is something that's it's kind of controversial. Um. One of the great failings of my opinion of science is that if it can't readily explain something immediately, then it's just poop poo's it. But it's looking more and more like which is a scientific term for discredit. I think, yeah, poo poo, um, it is looking more and more like dogs can sense epilepsy. Now, I think one of the misleading things in these two articles can animals predict death? And can a dog really predict a seizure is the use of the word predict. There is no prediction. I was reading this awesome article on CNN and it was about a woman named Klie Johnson and she has um epilepsy and cerebral palsy, so she has a seizure. She is in trouble. She she wrote, She's in a wheelchair and she has to wear a helmet all the time because of this UM. And she actually recently got a a dog that is a UM seizure sensing dog, epilepsy trained seizure alert dog. That's what it's called. Yeah um. Now, there's all sorts of seizure response dogs. This is established fact. Dogs can be trained to um basically go get help, bring food or a blanket. UM. Some lay on top of their owners while they're having caesars to like to keep um. Yeah, to keep from any kind of uh, further injury or right. Um. This is different though totally different, because that's a response. This is an alert. Um. She has a dog that she got actually chucked from up the street. In alfred and Georgia, there's a group called Canine Assistance. Yeah and um. In the last few years they've trained a hundred seizure dogs. Um. And they actually this is the cool part. Caesar dogs um tend to be one of the more expensive dogs, like ten g twenty grand for a dog to train and keep it healthy and fed over its lifetime. Right, yes, that's for the lifetime. Yeah, veterinary care, that kind of think. That's way more than the average dog. Um. The cool thing about Canine Assistance is that they the people who get their dogs kidding for free and they actually fly the people there their dogs recipients out to Atlanta to hang out with the dog for two weeks and they pay for everything that pay for air fair um, lodging, food, the whole shebang. Um. And they actually also pay for the dogs veterinary and food bills for the rest of its life. Yeah. That is a great organization. It's a canine assistance out of Alpharetta, Georgia, and they are doing some good in the world. Um. But anyway, there in this article there were two funny well one was terribly ironic, the other was kind of funny. UM. The the the researcher a neurologist who is poo pooing the concept that UM dogs can predict seizures. His name is Dr Gregory Berkley. Barkley, you give me this look, and I was like, I'm missing something here, and he said, and I actually agree with him. He points out that the dogs can't predict seizures UM, but that it's actually responding to an earlier stage of the seizure before the patient is aware that the caesuar is going on. Okay, like an eye movement or dilation, possibly a smell, something that the patient's not aware of. And the big problem with seizures is that if you're driving a car, yeah, and you have a seizure, so long, right, And I know that the ones who are good at this, the dogs are good at this, can predict anywhere. But I mean sometimes it's like thirty seconds, which is enough time to pull a car over. But this one lady said that she gets about a thirty to forty five minute heads up from her her dog, so did MS Johnson. She gets anywhere from twenty to forty minutes. And this this dog that she just got last year named ben Um, he's actually her second. Here's the here's the horribly ironic thing. Um. She had another great seizure dog for twelve years named McKeever, who actually helps through her roughest time. She was having many more seizures I think, uh, I think about ten a week maybe, and it's actually gone down since then. But he was really working over time. She had him for twelve years until two thousand and seven when he died after having his own seizure. Boy, isn't that awful? Yeah, this podcast officially became one that my wife will not listen to. I will steer her away from this. Yeah, dogs having seizures is kind of sad. Yeah, but what an irony is? So it is possible for a dog to uh Again, we shouldn't use the word predict the seizure, and they don't necessarily have to be trained, right, Chuck? Aren't some of them just the household pets that are picking up on this just from living around people with epilepsy. Right, And I think they've also decided that it's uh not breed specific either, so it's not I don't think they found any specific breed has been any better than the next. Right, Is that true? Uh? Yeah, I remember. I think it's the impression I have is that it's more exposure to epilepsy than anything else, and looking for signs and queues, and then the second stages learning to not be afraid of what happens when the owner's eyes roll back ahead and they start trembling, and then they alert. They all have their different ways of alerting. Some poet them, some lick their hand. Uh. Some I think walk around in circles or make a close eye contact. So it's pretty cool. They have their different messages they'll send the owner. Yeah you got anything else? No, I don't think so, Josh. I would like to say, UM. One of the things that I have read in researching this was that, UM, people, since it's not proven, and since if it if it does work, if a dog can sense a seizure early on just from being around someone with epilepsy. UM, I read over and over again that people are kind of warned from staying away from um dog breeders or trainers that charge you like twenty grand for a dog UM, especially with with groups like Canine Assistants out there doing lots of good. Yeah, and they can never guarantee to That's the other takeaway I had is that doctors say that this can be you can be a good thing, but it's certainly not a fail safe and you should never like rely on this as your only means of helping yourself out if you have. But at the end, even if the dogs hit and they feel pretty good and they can and they also doctors said, they do provide the companionship and the and all the other good things. Ultimately, you have a dog, and how can you go wrong when you got a dog? Exactly? My dogs the only thing they can predict is five o'clock dinner time. And so where am I? What does that leave me? Um? Feeding the dogs? But feeding the dogs, it's their world and I'm just living in it. If you want to learn more about animals and their sixth senses? How is that type in animals and predict in the search part how stuff works dot com? And uh, that leaves us with only one possibility, the possibility that it is time for listener mail. It is Josh. This is part two of high fructose Corn Syrup Replies. Seriously, dude, I'm telling you these For some reason, corn brings out the smarts because these people were awesome and it was not just fluffy like so many fanmail. No, I'm just kidding, Wow, Chuck, just kidding. Uh. This is from when in Los Angeles and when says, uh, he wants to add a little bit about what we said about HFCs. He said, you said it was very cheap, and that's why it's used to such extent. True enough, but you did not mention. And we had a couple of people right in about this is that the price of HFCs has kept artificially low by the policies of the US government. US government has placed a quota on sugar imports to the US in order to protect the domestic sugar producers and sugars. Case are called tariff rate quotas. So that provides for a low tariff on certain quantity which is a quota amount, and a higher tariff on any quantity above that level. So this creates an artificial shortage of sugar that drives up US prices and supports American sugar growers, but it also makes sugar a very expensive product. Just to give you an idea, last year, the price per pound of sugar in the United States was about fifty five cents and the world price was about eighteen cents. Wow. Is that amazing? God, I wish I'd lived in Portugal. Uh. In contrast, Josh HFCs runs about twenty five cents per pound. What So it is no surprise that when President Reagan drastically lowered the quota for sugar in the eighties, driving up the domestic price way way up, the major soft drink maker switch from sugar to high princ dos corn strups. So there you have it, and thank yeah. If the if the sugar market in the US was unrestricted, there will be no economic consented for anyone to use HFCs, and those quotas would be removed from the sugar market. Is uh that they would be removed as pretty much impossible now because there's too much money at stake. So we had other people writing in about this and that's it seems to be. It's going on. Yeah, So thank you. When in Los Angeles you are super fan an awesome field reporter will call you, hey, you know what, we should start saying what we're going to do in the future and let people tell us ahead of time. Then we can work it into the podcast and give him zero credit for it. That's true field reporters. We have field reporters. Yeah, eye reporters.
