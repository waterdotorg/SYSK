Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know? From House stoff Works dot com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. Yes, it's about antiques on Josh Clark. There's a very eager, strangely eager Charles W. Chuck Bryant, uh, and this is stuff you should know. The podcast, the hundred year old podcast at least makes us an antique. Do you can tell though from the hair in my ears that I'm getting up there? Yeah? Nose hair, ear hair. That's That's the joke about man, right, is that hair leaves the places you want it and accumulates where you don't want so, Chuck Um, you know how you think about certain things, and uh, you come across like a concept like antiques. You're collecting and buying and selling of old stuff. That's my definition. But I think it's pretty much dead on um And you think this has always been around and you stop and think, no, that's probably not true. So when did it start? And I am very gratified to say we know when the popular obsession with antiques began? Isn't that weird? I didn't know this until I read this, and it actually ties in with the other one recording today, Volcanos. So here's a little piece of trivia for you that will eventually appear on a quiz. How are antiques and the volcanoes podcast related? Strange glue Herculaneum and Pompeii. Mount Vesuvius binds these two, right, So tell them about it, Chuckers. Well, there was a big old eruption in seventy nine, a d of Vesuvius, and it pretty much buried Pompeii and the sister city, Herculaneum between about twenty ft of junk of ash. Well, we'll get to that in the vault, which is not you know, that's a bad thing for all the people there, but the bad thing who died screaming, but it preserved them dying screaming. I used to be so obsessed with that, with national anything I could get my hands on, and it was like, look at that skeleton crawling towards the sea. Look at this guy who was caught in a boat's yeah, I loved it. So uh many years after that, Charles the third of Spain and the seventeen early sevent undred said hey, let's go dig this stuff up and see what we can find. And it turns out they found a bunch of well preserved antiques and they became like, wow, old stuff is cool. Right, So these two entire cities were basically frozen in time and protected from looters, and they started bringing these treasures up and it actually sparked the neo classical period or movement, I guess in Europe, and that was like the antiques right, and then in America. So that's worldwide antiques or at least western uh popularity of antiques. Right, what about American? Right? We can actually trace the moment where Americans get interested in antiques too. It's it's I love this very cool. Once again, our our seventeen seventy six. You know, America is a young, budding country. A hundred years later, we celebrate our first little centennial in Philadelphia and they said, hey, you know what, We've got a hundred years worth of stuff we've been making and let's let's showcase this. And all of a sudden people were like the same thing, like wow, this is kind of cool. I like this old stuff that we've got. That's exactly right, And that sparked an interest in early American furniture, I think to start with, right, I'm gonna start buying it and I'm gonna start collecting it, and it became a commodity. Right. So, Um, the the eighteen seventies six exposition was what sparked an interest in antiques in the US. Uh. And if you so, we're going to focus mostly on American antiques, and by mostly I mean exclusively, right, Well, a little Europe thrown in, Okay, so not exclusively, but mostly was. Um. But if you are an antique collector today, and you are a very puritanical one could say antique collector, um, you're probably going to say that anything prior to eighteen thirty, UM, in America and probably anywhere is an antique. Anything after it's kind of up in the air. And the reason being is around eighteen thirty the Industrial Revolution started. People stopped using like dovetailed joints that they sawed by hand or whittled down by hand and using wooden pegs and started using machines. Stopped. But yeah, well it fell for mass manufacturing exactly. So this advent of mass manufacturing led to a huge boom in um in in production. Coupled with this new interest post like eighteen seventy six in early American furniture, and so a revival of these styles, right, So you have mass manufacturing and a revival of interest in early American styles mean that you have a lot of reproduction furniture being produced. Yeah, but reproduction furniture is is what you want us the real deal, right, which is period. So period is something made in the style of the period in the age in that age like Queen Anne. Sure not Queen Anne reproduction or Chippendale reproduction, which, by the way, is the sexiest furniture period in American history if you ask me. Those uh the little cuffs and nothing. But yeah, yeah, I'll a picture when I hear that is swayzy and what a classic one. Heppa White, Cheriton, Duncan Fife, just a name of you, Yes, of our heroes. Yeah, those are the those are the big ones. And I'm sure if you're really into this you could you can be like Duncan Fife. Yeah. I go for Duncan Hines. Yeah, Duncan Chic. Remember that guy. It sounds really familiar. He hes a singer. He had a song which one I can't remember he was. He's a one hit guy. Well, Chuck, yes, Uh, if you are getting in do antiques, right, you probably already know all this stuff. Um way into it. But let's say let's say that you are you really uh no, I'm into walking around antique flea markets, but I'm not. I don't know you know what I'm doing. I just like tooling around and poking things. Yeah, you know, it's funny. Um. I think Billy Bob Thornton wrote possibly one of the greatest lines in the history of film, and he said something about he made um Dwight yoakum saying sling blade that he can barely drink a glass water around a piece of antique furniture. So awful and so funny in that movie at the same time. It's a good line. Um. I like walking around antique places too. I don't like encountering antique wheelchairs or antique medical equipment. I love that stuff. It's so freaky. Well, I don't use it. But yeah, well you really shouldn't like probably not sterile any longer. Um. But okay, so let's let's say that you are not completely versed in in antiques what to look for. We're gonna give you a brief primer here, and since we are owned by Discovery Communications aka the Discovery Channel, we get to draw from the company well and talk to people once in a while who have shows on Discovery, specifically in this one, a guy named Paul Brown who heads up a show called Auction Kings. Right, he owns a Gallery sixty three which is literally just up the road a piece from a San Roswell road. I'm gonna have to visit that. And he is a an auction king. I've seen it myself with my own eyes, and we talked to him actually, so he's gonna come in a little bit um here there. When you hear someone that sounds like they're on the telephone and it's not us, right, yeah, well we'll we'll teake him up a little better than that. But that to give rule of thumb I think for this one. Um. But what Paul says and what it what it expresses in this article how antiques work, um, is that the first way to differentiate a real antique, a period piece from a reproduction piece, um and kind of get an idea of how much value this thing is gonna hold ultimately is just by looking it over. That's the first best thing you can do is take a really good hard look at it, right, So, uh, what are some of the things we're looking for? Well, uh, just at first glance, I would say overall condition, like what kind of shape it's in. And this is not to determine whether it's real or fake. This is just if you're assuming it's a real antique because apparently high quality fakes. Don't be afraid of that, because it's pretty rare to to pass one off, to try and pass one off, although Paul said in an interview that he just came across one right, like he had gotten off a call with a buddy who informed him that something he was thinking about or somebody was trying to sell him was in fact a fake faberge, like right before we interviewed him. So he said, it does happen. It's very uncommon, especially with furniture too. It's so difficult to do this. So what you're really looking for is not necessarily a counterfeit, but a reproduction, right it exactly? So, um here here's here are a couple of tips that Paul gave us. Right, a cursory glance will tell you'll tell a lot of tales I mean even to to an inexperienced eye, if you open up the doors and you see there, you know, nails or uh holding it together rather than dovetails in Morrison tennant joints, and you know it's probably of later manufacturer. Um. You know, evenly evenly cut nails were not even made until you know this center. We're not this century, laugh, it's the twentieth century. It's probably that the most nails were handmade. And so if you've got a lot of evenly cut nails looks like they were driven in there with a nail gun, you know, that's that's a big that's a big tip off. So there's a couple of things you look for in Yeah, I mean craftsmanship, how it was put together is uh. I mean they're still craftsman today doing things in the old school way, but by and large when you look at the joints and the tools might leave marks, yes, um, hardware used like nails, Like Paul said, Yeah, so that's what you're gonna look forward to determine if it was you know, probably a reproduction or not. And then what the stuff is made out of is actually going to um leave a lot of clues to specifically with furniture. Um, the wood used, it's very important. Right, So for example, chuck, you've got um. Like walnut was very popular with Queen Anne, which apparently ran from the early eighteenth century to about seventeen fifty when Chippendale took over. Right, we know so much about the wood used an antique furniture. It's a uh, Mahogany came in the fashion after that, right, and then a cherry, which is sort of like mahogany, it's just a little paler, very strong and abundant here in the old us of A. So that was pretty popular as well. Yeah, oak has always been popular. Yeah. Oka is especially popular among Europeans before the beginning of the eighteenth century, and then it had some renewed popularity in America around nineteen hundred. I personally don't go for oak that much. I like either really pale blonde maple, hate wind. Do you really like maple? I just don't like pale. I don't like blond wood. It reminds me of ikea. Yeah, I think it's one of the reasons I like it that look it's like minimal and it's really cold outside. Uh. And then Chuck there's also um pine, right, poor pine. Pine is um. Well, let's just go ahead and say it. It's the the poor person's would when you're manufacturing furniture, your country folk, your rural you just want a chair to sit in. Maybe you're really good at making a chair, so a hundred and fifty two hundred years later, somebody wants to pay top dollar for that. But for the most part, pine is used for the undersides of the backings, uh, the drawers, insides of of a piece of furniture. Right, yeah, but wood floor is actually hard to pine floors. That's what we have in our house. That's those are. Yeah, those are like a find. Apparently there's a guy done in Florida. Um. Apparently there's a logging operation in like the nineteenth century in Florida, and they would fell this pine and float it down the river to the sawmill. Every once in a while, something would be Uh it was so dense it would just sink. And it happened a lot and they just leave them. But for some reason, the composition of the water, I think it was like this brackish combination of stea and fresh water. Um, somehow preserve these these trees these huge trees, and there's a company that brings these things up in salvages, these this nineteenth century heart pine and sells it for like top dollars lumber. Yeah, we haven't had this exact conversation before. It was a while ago though, which which pod. It was a long time ago, but it bears saying. I think I think I'm going in saying this is so cool. So it's like, why are you laughing? But I like pines, So that's why I said, poor pine, um, plywood and particle board. That's a dead giveaway that it's not an antique. Don't be stupid. As our staples, we should mention staples are a hallmark of twentieth century manufacture. Exactly, condition of the wood you should look at that is what shrink Yeah, so it shrinks and it leaves a lot of clues. Right, so you know the bottom of a drawer, you know how in a really good construction it's kind of slatted in. Yeah, so as it shrinks, it's not going to be flush any longer. And not only will that shrinkage be a dead giveaway, but that that portion, that the shrunken part, the now exposed part, should be lighter in color and the stuff that's been exposed to underwear for the last two years underwear. Yeah. Um. Also that you know, they used to use a pegs a lot of times to as simple furniture. So if if the pegs are have worked their themselves out a little bit, that's probably a good uh sign that there's been some shrinkage going on in the underwear drawer. Uh. What else we talked about pegs, dovetail joints. I think Paul mentioned dovetail joints and mortis and tenon joints are really, you know, a hallmark of early craftsmanship. So you look for those tools handstanding. It's gonna look different than machine standing, as is a hand saw rather than like the perfect straight edge of a saw mill saw. You can actually, if you know what you're doing, you can kind of roughly date what like the age of your piece of furniture by the saw marks. Right. Um. So you're gonna want to look at the back of a chair or the drawer. It's an inconspicuous area that they probably didn't bother to sand. Um. If there are straight, irregular marks, that's pre eighteen thirty. Uh. If they're straight even marks. That means that it was around eighteen thirty sawmills. We're cutting these straight even marks, perfectly straight. And then circular marks came in about eighteen fifty, when the Industrial Revolution was really starting to take off. People like, our furniture doesn't have to be square anymore. Yes, you know, it really took me. And this one was when I read this sentence. Nails were originally made forged individually. I mean, does that really hit home? Do you think how many nails it takes to build a structure, and the blacksmith had to make every nail one at a time. That's why the blacksmith was usually the man to go crazy on the rest of the town and kill everyone in their sleep. Yeah, with something made of heavy metal, probably that's what I would use. Uh, where are we here buying them? You wanna talk about buying antiques? Yeah, and um, we should probably say that. You know, if you're into antiques, especially if you're really an antiques, you're probably doing it at least partially for profit, right, hoping to maybe make a little money off of it. Well, Paul pointed out that you should buy you should only buy something if you like it. At excellent point. I thought that was a great point. Usually you're looking you know, you think it's worth something as well, right, And we asked him about value, like how does an antique get valued? And here's what he said. For worth is what you can get somebody to pay for it on a given day, not what in you know, insurance company or a museum or in you know, a quote expert says it's worth. So you know what the biggest factor is, supplying the man, how many people in the audience want it. You know, I bring something up that five people want, it's going to bring more than than somebody might have thought it was worth if it comes out and it's you know, only one person wants it or nobody wants it, whether it's going to bring less, but the reality is that's that's what it was worth that day in this building. So you know, it's it's just kind of a weird dynamic. Worth is a is a real funny thing. It's it's it's like trying to nail jello. So that was Paul once again, Josh I could tell he was on the phone. He was on the phone. Uh, if you if you don't know anything and you want to learn something, about antiques. Here's some advice from how staff works dot com. Just start buying things. Will now go to a museum, because museums are a great place to You're gonna you're gonna know it's real, it's authenticated by pro It's probably gonna be grouped by either the manufacturer of the period, so you get like a really specific view of what you're looking at it and then probably be identified by the maker. And you might have a docent there that has some like history. So that's a really good place to learn about this stuff. Yeah, there's usually somebody there you can say what does this mean? Or why is that there? And they go move along. Yeah uh. And then the next thing, you know, that chairs out there any longer because you just exposed it as a fraud, much like the um Brewster chair. Right, yes, have you heard about this? And I talked about another podcast or something. No, that's known as the greatest hoax of all time, greatest antique hoax of all time, greatest antique furniture hoax of all time. Let's get specific here, huh that let it know that well, think about it's a chair. Surely there's other antique hoaxes. Well, this is the greatest, This is the Ali This is the O. J. Simpson Trial of Antiques. So the Ford Museum was taken by a chair that was supposedly created by pilgrims from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Right, Yeah, but they weren't taken by the chair. They were taken by La Montaigne armand Lamont. He sounds like a fake furniture guy. He sounds like a forger armand La Montaigne faked the Brewster chair just to see if he could fool the experts. And he did. Yeah, which apparently is quite popular and especially was in the seventies or hoaxx all over the place. Have you seen f is for fake? No? Okay, you know our buddy recommended this movie. It's the Orson Wells documentary on art forgery. Okay, so we saw it, right, you mean I watched it. It's very interesting. It's the Who's Well I thought he was talking about the Doors and Walls TV show when he had Burt Reynolds on. No, but it's in the it's in a similar stylus, really edited very strangely, right, But the content of it is um Clifford Irving, the guy who faked the biography of um. Howard Hughes also wrote a biography on a great art forger named Elmir, and Elmir is like this guy who's like, I just do this to show that all the experts are idiots and I've never signed anything, and I toss everything. And his biographer, who actually turns out to be a hoax himself, Clifford Irving, is like that, it's not true. That guy is fraudulent and he's making money off of it. But it makes a good point that we you said in the museum, you're gonna be able to probably rely on it being legitimate. That's where you can really learn the point of this movie is that's not necessarily true. I mean, like, if you can pass something by the experts, then it's legitimate and in just about everyone's eyes, and that apparently is fairly rampant in the art world. Yeah. Well, the Brister chair, though, they put it through an X ray and they were they were all of a sudden, they were like, ah, yeah, La Montage, Yeah. La Montage had said, like, you know, I faked the chair like several a couple of decades ago, and you bought it. Somebody bought it and then now they used that chair though as an example of how to be not be duped. I guess what do they? What does Oprah call that? At a learning moment or a teaching moment? Yeah, I think something like that. So uh, if you have learned a few things here and you do want to buy antiques, where should he go? H? Well, you said the museums, and you're ready to buy and just start anywhere you can. If you go to a small town in small in America and you close your eyes and just start walking forward and don't get hit by a car going around the square, you're going to run into an antique store. Yes, And depending on the size of the shop, if it's like a smallest shop, then that means probably that the shop owner picked out all the antiques because there's things that they like in things that they think will sell. Or like a flea market, they'll usually have little booths and you can rent out your own little booth and sell stuff. So you'll probably get like a big wide variety there. That's right. Um where else? Well, auctions if you want to, if you want to add a little zing to your antiques or your antique buying experience, experience right to the auction is very much like an experience, and you get to buy stuff too, right. Um, And we talked to Paul about this. We'll bring him back in a second. But if you want to really kind of hone your hangling skills or you know, just kind of know your limits, you can start off in a small store and just go basically abuse the store owner and then hone and go to a couple of auctions and by boom, by being you might be ready. But this is what you're in for. It's not nearly as um scary as we've been made to believe. Apparently what auctions, Yeah, listen, listen to pul check. The auction can be Uh, it's nature almost. I think maybe Howard did it or I don't know what happened exactly, but um, you know, a lot of people are intimidated by the auction process. What I always encourage people do is come in early, you know, maybe come in the week before and take a look around, preview, you know, take some measurements, kick the tire, so to speak, open the door, see if you're dovetail, see if it's if you're buying, or if you're potentially buying what you think you're potentially buying. Ask questions because we're always here to answer them. And you know, if I don't know, I'll say I don't know. But if I do know, I'm happy to share and say so is my stuff. But you know, and then as the auction be approaches, you know, you come in, get settle in and kind of watch it, kind of get a fearful. It's a lucamic thing, and each auction is a dynamic and fluid. It's almost organic the way it kind of grows, and you see, okay, these things are going high, those things are going kind of watch it a little bit and then just don't be intimidated to to bid, don't don't let me get you know, to your head. Just kind of play play the game. It's like going to the casino sort of. You kind of get a rush out of it. It's fun. So that was some good advice. Like they'll they'll usually have a display period where you can go check it out up close before the auction, and if you've never been to an auction, it can get caught up in it. You know, have you ever been doing auction of any kind? Silent auction at a church, very low pressure. I mean one where the guys you know doing the whole thing. Cattle auction, I've been to those before. Did you buy for each catal auction? Kid? You not? Did you buy a cow? I'm just a do you want to check out beforehand? Know exactly what you want, what you're willing to pay, and don't get caught up in the auction fever because, as Paul pointed out, and as anyone knows, something is worth what someone's gonna pay for it. And and if you've got all these people bidden on, it's just like eBay, it's the same thing. You get all these I never understood the eBay people that you know in an auctions for like a week and on day one they start throwing bids in. Yeah, I've never understood anything. Well. Sellers love it because it just drives up the price. But I mean as a as a buyer, it doesn't make none at all. On eBay. I go in the last like second and a half my first bid, right and we we also talked to Paul about um, you know what what you should buy or if there's something in your home, and he was saying like it's very surprising how something that seems like it would never sell, or something you take his ordinary commonplace because you grew up around it and it's now in your home and you walk past it every day, that that suddenly takes on value when a guy like him creates a market by taking a seller and putting them together and putting his stuff in front of buyers. Right, So, so you're absolutely right. I mean, like there, things do have value even if they don't seem like they have value. And you can make some dough it in auction, or you can spend a bunch of dough it in auction. You can also do an internet auction, which requires a tremendous amount of faith. Yeah, I mean eBay has their little rules of you gotta be on the upend up, but you can really kind of do anything on there if you want. Yeah, there's antique shows that are you know, like this weekend and North Georgia there's a show and the Georgia Mountain fair Grounds. It's a big deal. Everyone brings their stuff and from them once a year and not just made it up. And obviously a state sales. Keep your eyes peeled in the newspaper and Craigslist and stuff for state sales, you get some good fine and the cool thing about the state sales, especially if you if you find an estate sale and the sign for it is on like a piece of poster board with black sharpie, that means it's a yard sale. That means that it's well, it could be there. There could be some really great stuff there, and it's being sold by people who don't know anything, and there's probably no reserve price, which is the minimum bid that will be accepted. Um. So yeah, state sales can be treasure troves, especially if you like stuff that smell like um that elderly. Right, let me say that, I think so mothballs. Yeah. Uh. If you're checking things out at these places, look for a signature of the maker to help authenticate it. That's kind of a dead giveaway. If you see like a brand on furniture like on the underside, or um on glassware and ceramics is usually on the on the bottom. What else. Well, yeah, that's a that's a good point that there's there should be a signature there because the difference, the only difference really between a reproduction and a counterfeit, uh, is the stamp of the craftsman. Right, the mark of the craftsman saying like I made this in. I'm not trying to pass it off as something made in. Yeah. Well, sometimes there's other documentation too that someone will include, like this is uh a photo of my great great grandmother with this chest of drawers or chiffer robe, and um, here's a and then here's it's included in the ill from too. And there's a letter um from my great grandfather to my great grandmother about the chiff robe. And I'm gonna give you all this saying bust up that chiffer robe to help to help document that it is in fact. Yes, and if you have that much documentation, you're in like full in because apparently being able to prove providence, especially famous providence, can apparently just drive the price up. There's a story in this article about a person who attended the two thousand to Tucson Antiques roadshow of it and showed up with a you first phase chief's blanket, which is rare enough, like this thing was appraised that three and fifty five hundred thousand dollars, but the person said that it once belonged to Kick Carson, but couldn't prove it, but had he or she proven it, then it would have increased the value by another hundred and fifty grand just because Kick Carson slept in it for a while. Al Right, pretty sweet. Huh. Yeah, there's I look at a lot of Craigslist guitars, you know, just I'm not in the market, but I always just look, and there's always every day there's always some two that has a really cheap CREDI guitar and he's like it was signed by the Kip Winger and there's just the scrawl and sharpie on it. And you know, there're as some like five hundred bucks for hundred dollar guitar with Inger maybe don doc into Uh what else can you look for, Josh? If you have a CT scan in your house, or an X ray machine or infrared analysis or ultra violet analysis, you can do it that way, Yes, if you're so lucky to have those kind of things in your home or your medical clinic. Or look at the antique dealer. If they're on the up and up, they're probably a member of one of the professional associations. And then also if you follow Paul Brown's advice and buy what you like, and you're you're pretty much buying for yourself. Uh, then you may end up using your antiques, displaying it, keeping it out in the opening your normal house. And if you do that, you're gonna want to keep up with it. Right, So if you have an antique clock, you're gonna want to wind it regularly. Uh. If you have a rug or blanket or something like that, maybe up on the walls better place than on the floor, right. Um. And uh then other uh kind of more fragile stuff like books, sheet music, manuscripts. Um, you wanna store these upright out of the sun. Yeah, we want to make sure there's no newspaper pressing between them. Highly acidic, bad for an antique book. Probably not in the basement or the attic. You want a good neutral temperature. Your books want to be in the same climate you're in. Yeah. Did you like that it's a T shirt right there. Photographs you should store in their own individual envelope and then that envelope in a box. Don't like out of the sun. Yeah, don't stick them all together and like put a brick on top of them. They're gonna end up being a goooey mess. It's not a good way to store your photos and you're also gonna want to buy a nice pair of cotton gloves when you start collecting antique photographs of any kind, whether it's glass or metal degarat type. If you're into Matthew Brady or being a mime, remember the Brady Bunch where it turned out that Matthew Brady was related to Mr Brady and they showed like a picture it was a de Garat type of Abraham Lincoln in the background is Mike Brady. Yeah, it's a good one. I do remember that. I'm like, this is like the second Chris Farley reference. Yeah, we did the Chip Indels thing and then like the remember when he a text Scorsese. Do you remember you got anything else? Set it for auctions and uh antiques and that kind of thing. I think it is. We want to give a hearty thanks to Paul Brown. Congratulations and good luck. It's nice to see another Atlanta boy making good that's right, um, And we're gonna drop by Gallery sixty three one day, maybe a good picture made with him. How about that he invited us so it wouldn't be like stalking, and you know, check out auction Kings obviously if you want to learn more about antiques. You can type word antiques or antiquities is as it's also called antiques is slang for antiquities. You know that that was it? Yeah, you can type that into the search bar at how stuff works dot com the dusty old search bar and needed polishing found in our attic. All right, Yes, that's what I'm trying. Now, how does it work? I think it's great that brings up then listener male, I'm gonna call this, uh polyamory A polyamorous young lady. Yeah, hello from a polyamoroust. Yeah, hi, guys. Today I was feverishly sewing tiny pieces of silk together and cursing myself for attempting such an elaborate Christmas gift for my sister. When why would anyone want? Multiple spouses started playing? I put down my thumble and listen even more intently than usual for I myself and a polyamoroust. I'm a twenty one year old female living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which I believe is in America's hat. I've flown over that. I have two partners, Jesse and Kumarn, and of two three and two years, respectively. Jesse and I lived together. We all happened to be humanitarian atheists. Jesse and Komb have been friends since well before I met either of them, but they do not have a physical relationship together. Both of them are able to pursue relationships with other people, and I have had a lady friend in the last three years to boot as well. To minimize the risk of s t I s, we maintain a fluid bond and no one has intercourse with someone outside the bond without an s t I test. Jealousy has never been an issue. For some reason. Jesse actually encouraged me to start dating Komb, and when Jesse was dating his lady friend, I was really pleased and excited. All of our parents know we are out to our co workers and friends. I have no desire to get married, but I know of many polyamorous families who do or are. I would say the benefits of polyN me for us, at least, because a twentysomething family with no children boils down to more more people to love, more people to be loved by, more sources of support, more ideas, more perspective or Christmas gifts. The most importantly, more people to gun down, zombies and left for dead. Is that one of the safe places, one of the safe areas in the Zombie Apocalypse Saskatoon. Yeah, I'm sure three shotguns are better than two. I would also like to point out that living communally where everyone has sexual access quote unquote to everyone else is relatively rare in polyamory. More commonly it's just three or four or four person relationships or quote unquote open relationships, or even primary and secondary relationships. So that in tertiary is from lydia Well, thanks a lot, lydia Um is very nice to have that little peek into your life. Thank you up there. Plus also she left out and say s cartoon it gets really cold up there. Yeah, real cold. Imagine a three person snuggle is pretty warm. It's like three dog night, do you know? That's where that came from the Aborigines in Australia. On a particularly cold night, they would sleep with three dogs around him. The three dog night is a really really cold night, and that's where the bank got their name.
