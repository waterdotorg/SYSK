Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to you stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as Charles W. Chuck Bryant and uh, this is stuff you should do. That's right. A Shark Week edition. Week edition, Happy Shark Week, Chuck, Happy Shark Week. In honor of Shark Week, I got you a little present. Wow. Yeah, what is that? It's the jabber Jaw DVD box set? Oh is it? That's awesome? Thank you. Yeah, I was going to get you speed Buggy. Um. If I am correct, then this should be coming out the Thursday before Shark Week. Oh good time. Yeah. So Shark Week actually starts in three days on Sunday. I'm so embarrassed that I give you president early. That's okay, okay, we we like to open on Christmas Eve. Here. Um, are you're doing okay? You're feeling good? Yeah? I thought that we wouldn't be able to find anything here to do on sharks, but we never really covered specifically shark attacks. Yeah. I think it's high time we did, because I think that, Um, thanks to a growing, growingly, increasingly enlightened, populous, sharks are losing a lot of the bad rap they had for many, many years since. And I feel like we're here to kind of help hasten that along a little bit and strike fear into your heart. Well, yeah, it depends this. This This is going to be kind of a roller coaster ride, because this article is a roller coaster ride. We're talking about how shark attacks work, um, and we should say first and foremost, right off the bat, that you can make a pretty good case almost all shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity. Yeah. I don't know if this is a real stat but um, Gary Atkinson, who is a diver more a big just big mistakes more usually indicates not a real stat probably, but I bet it's pretty high because, especially when it's contained in a book that has an exclamation point in the title. Sharks don't like people that were not fatty enough for them. They don't seek us out, they don't like the way we taste, and when they bite us, they probably think we are a big turtle or a sea lion. That's just that's what's going on. And when you look at the photo. Was it bioluminescence we talked about looking up from the ocean. Yeah, and you see the silhouette, a dude on a surfboard or a lady on a surfboard looks an awful lot like a sea turtle or a sea lion. Yeah. If you're interested, go to how stuffworks dot com and type in how sharkitects working. On the first page, there's a pretty cool little illustration of how a surfer looks like a sea turtle or or a sea lion. I wouldn't know what the spinning image. The point is is by looks you, you may look like a sea lion. Once the shark figures out that you're not, however, it's probably going to leave you alone. The great white, we should say, But of course it may be too late. At that point. In between those two points, the sharks gonna bite you, probably, especially if it's a great white. Um. That's pretty much the number one reason for shark attacks, like we said, is you are confused for another food source. Um. And if it is a great white and you are bitten, and it will probably leave you alone and not come back right And depending on the severity of that first bite, that test bite as they call it um, which a could be um I think your food or be apparently uh, there's a food chain of sharks. Even well they were, they will like bite another shark to say, did get away from me? And I know I didn't hurt you that bad because your shark. But if you're human, all of a sudden your midsection is missing. That's another explanation for shark at texts. Aggression. Yeah, if the sharks are if they are just kind of messing around with one another when they do it to you, that hurts confusion. Um aggression. Hunger is another one too. And if you're like say a spear fisherman, and you're just laying waste to like a school of fish coco cocoon, cocoon, right, um, and the fish are flapping around, they're bleeding, you have two huge stimulus. There's a stimuli. Yeah, man, this whole bailout just screw me up. Man. Um that the sharks can pick up that are that they are specially designed, if you believe in intelligent, designed to pick up um blood in the water, and they can smell that stuff for miles, dude, for miles, and I couldn't find any actual real stat on that. I think I've seen like another one of those sharks stats which are always a little hinky, which is like they can smell blood, like a drop of blood for five miles or something, right, Yeah, but they can they can they smell some blood. They can smell some blood. Yeah. The other way that they're being attracted is the fish flapping around actually generates electrical impulses, and the shark have an organ called the ampullae of Lorenzini you should say this chuck, which is basically a series of tubes that are connected that connect the exterior of the skin with um electricity or electrical sensing cells. That basically it's another way of sharks detecting movement prey. It's on the snout. So when you have a bunch of fish dying that it's going to attract the shark. And if you're standing in the middle of it, the shark is not really gonna care what you look like or what you're doing. There's just so worked up it's gonna bite you and confused. Maybe, uh, what I learned from the sharkles you don't want to confuse the shark. No, and you don't want to be standing in the middle of their um, their prey, like a big massive their prey um. And also too, I know we're pointed this out before in the I think, how to defend yourself, but the Apulia Laurentzen gonna bunch that one. It's in the snout. So that's why they tell you to like trying head butter, punch the shark in the mouth. Now you imagine get taking a sock right to the electrical cells. I can't imagine delivering that punch, like having the wherewithal to be like, oh, I'm supposed to punch you, now I'm missing an arm. I think you. I think you might surprise yourself. You just react. If you have a healthy ego, then you would. Yeah, you'd probably punch that shark. Um. I don't. You can't say that. You just haven't been put in any life threatening situations yet. Okay yet, alright, so hold on, hold on, there's another good explanation for why sharks attack defense. Oh they feel threatened, Yeah by humans. Oh the divers that tug on the nurse sharks. Yeah, the nurse sharks a big one that likes to attack when somebody pulls on its tail. Yeah, and why people do this, I don't know, but apparently the nurse shark is kind of funny and that it sort of will be still at the bottom of the ocean and it wears a wig and the old nurses cap because you're like, I gotta push that thing around exactly. But apparently there are some divers who like, well like tug on their tail because they think it's just some harmless game, and then they find out that the hand because the nurse shark is generous with its bite, right. Um, so because of jerks like that pulling in a nurse shark tails. Um, there is a division in the statistics of shark attacks provoked and unprovoked jerks and what the heck happened? Or stupid people and what the heck happened? Why do you provoke a shark? Um? So let's talk about what goes down with the shark attack. Okay, here's the fair warning part. We're going. Um, we has been climbing a hill, now we're about to go down the hill. There are roller coaster ride Okay, okay, um, well what yeah, this is when you have fear? Should I read the Jaws thing? If you want, I might as well. Okay, all right, this is Quint from Jaws. The thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes, black eyes like a dolls eyes. When he comes at you, he doesn't even seem to be living until he bites you, and those black eyes roll over a white and then dot dot dot, Thank you. You're the rich little of this podcast. That was not a good Quint, but that's what it is. In my top ten, used to be in my top five all time movies. Jaws. Yeah what knocked it out? I don't know. Just over the years, you know, things built up. Jaws falls behind a little bit. Yeah what what knocked it out of the I don't know specifically what knocked it out? I'm sorry, but Jaws circuits was what of it was? Um? I mean every time this movie is on, I will watch it and I do not get sick of It's one of my favorites. So here's where we scare the crap out of you, because usually you will learn that you are being attacked by a shark by getting run into by a car, is what some people have said. It feels like it depends again, it depends on the shark. So we should point out The three most deadly sharks are great whites, tigers, and bull sharks bulls. If you get hit by what feels like a truck, it's probably a bull shark. If all of a sudden you're missing an arm, it was probably a great white or possibly a tiger. But it seems like bulls and tigers are the ones that bump you first, and the great white takes the test bite. Yeah, and bulls are known to for being one of the more aggressive as far as like usually a shark will bite you and then kind of leave you right and the bull shark will is one of the only ones that will come back repeatedly. Or someone's trying to save you, they might attack them. They'll they'll hang around a little more than I'm comfortable with one are the other big problems with the bull shark is that they attack in shallow water. Ye, so if you see a bullshark, just run um. So what's going on here with the test bite, Well, a could be a test bight b When they feed on like a sea lion, they don't just go in there and like feed on it like a frenzy until it's all gone. They bite it and then let it bleed to death, and then once the animal is dead, then they'll go an inchow down. So pretty frightening if you're a person it is. So you're saying that, Um, it's like getting hit by a truck. Let's say it's a bullet shark attack. Um. That's a quote from Don Shauman, who was pregnant as a lifeguard when she was attacked in Florida. Um. And she survived because she wrote a book about it. Another person who wrote a book, I believe uh is surfer Kenny doot doo u d t do. And he was doing his surfing thing in nineteen seventy nine in Oregon. I didn't know you surfed Oregon. Yeah, sure, surf Oregon. Well, I mean you got to have the wet suits. It's cold outher but it's cold in southern California too specific. Yea. Anyway, Kenny Do was surfing and all of a sudden, Um, he was a shark. This is probably a great white because all of a sudden he was in the jaws of a shark and it had it had him and his surfboard in its bite, and the surfboard probably saved his life because that shark was originally trying to like that because he couldn't get that full bite down. He's apparently very determined, and he kept trying and trying for about twenty seconds. By Duke's testament, dude was totally out of the water. He was pulled under the water and the shark couldn't get him under because again the surfboard. So he lived another day. He lived to see another day, although he said that the doctor who fixed him up um stopped counting his stitches when he reached five hundred, which is a pretty patient doctor, but also kind of lazy, like why do you get there and just be like, oh, you know what, forget it? He yeah, he took them all out at about two fifty because he forgot where he was and started over. And this is the guy that said he heard his like ribs breaking right, all right. You have to remember people, roller coaster. This is extremely rare. Chuck. We talked about how like the great white feeds bite, leave you to blie to death, come back and feed on you. Um. We talked about the bull shark. It hits and then circles, hitching in circles, and then eventually it's gonna bite you and like you said, like it'll attack somebody coming to try to rescue you. The tiger shark is um one of the deadliest ones, especially in the deep sea. Um. Apparently they like to pick off the week and the wounded like um, and they'll circle for a while and then they'll bump and then they'll bite. And there's this very famous story of the U S sus Indianapolis that was sunk in the Pacific in nineteen five. The story quintells, Oh, yeah, he was one of the dudes. Okay, this character Okay, not Robert Shaw right, um, although, man, that would have been some serious would it be method or character? I don't even know real life? Yeah, I guess it's not even acting. Um. So in in nine Indianapolis Thanking, a thousand crew members survived the sinking, but by the time the rescuers showed up a few days later, there were only three seventeen men left thanks to shark attacks, and these tigers were just circling them and like, according to quinn story, which is pretty accurate, just like you know, you'd be talking to a guy and all of a sudden he's gone and you're just waiting, and it didn't get called in because it was wasn't it They were delivering the bomb? Oh right, yeah, is that right? They were delivering the bomb, which is why it was such a top secret operation. And because it was top secret, it didn't get called in and reported missing for like a couple of days. Even so, it was pretty scary stuff. Yeah, all over, So that means that there's a undetonated nuclear bomb at the bottom of the Pacific. Actually, I don't know that part. I would guess. I mean, if they were delivering it and it was sunk, I have to look into that or maybe that. I don't think Steven Spielberg made that up. I think that's real. Yeah, it's definitely in the movie, though Steven Spielberg is not known for making things up. What there's like aliens et s. So you did say something kind of important here about um Finally, tiger sharks out in the deep sea are a little more dangerous. Most people get attacked closer to shore. And that doesn't mean you should be afraid because close to shore is dangerous. It's just because that's where the people are. Yes, you know, so most people don't swim out, you know, in the the middle of the deep blue ocean. Yeah, this guy wouldn't know. Well, that's the that's part of the point. Um so um, back down another another hill. It's a little bit a little bit scary now because we're gonna talk about what happens during the shark attack or what the shark attack does to your person. Well, one surgeon who operated on a teenage surfer in Australia said that when her leg was lopped off, he described as guillotine like. So it can be very swift in the case of a limb, and very clean, and all of a sudden there's just no arm there anymore. Forty pounds of pressure per square inch with his teeth, the size of a shot glass. If you listen to Richard Drynus, that's what he says in the movie. I okay, have you ever seen johs Okay, I don't know if I if it was ever in my top ten, it's like up there for sure, it's such a great movie, But I don't okay. I can recognize when you say things like quint and size of a shot class, shot class, and okay Cooper and all that stuff. Do you remember what Roy what's his name? Yeah, what his character was, Chief Brodie he dream brody uh noady Um. So if you don't lose a limb, you're probably gonna get like a large piece of your flesh removed, like from your thigh, from room mid section or something like that. Yeah. Usually if you're getting a type by a good size great white, it's gonna get you in your midsection. Like you said, uh and uh. You may end up like a guy named Rodney Fox who was a spear fisherman who was attacked near Adelaide, Australia, nineteen sixty three and basically he was bitten from shoulder to hip and a lot of them was missing after that. Have you seen pictures of that guy? Yeah? I did when I researched the shark stuff a couple of years ago. It's like a shark bite missing from him. Yeah, like a little crescent and out of the side of him. I don't know if little is the right word. Well, yeah, it's not little. Yeah, that's a pretty startling time life photo. I think you're probably gonna die by bleeding to death because you're gonna be suffering from massive amounts of blood loss at this point, and by the time you get into shore and get someone there to help you, it's maybe too late. So having someone on shore that can stop the blood is like really key to your survival. Um. And there's a kid who was attacked off Cape sam Blasts in two thousand five who was saved because the doctor and a nurse happened to be on shore on vacation and they stopped the bleeding by putting pressure on this leg, which I assume was where the shark bit him. Yeah. Um, but if you're in cold water, you actually have something in your favor and that the cold water is going to slow down your physical processes, so including your blood loss, so you'll you won't waste as much time in the trip to shore, right, So I guess the Pacific Ocean would be a little better in Oregon surf Oregon. Um. And then another thing, you're gonna run into his infection because you just got bitten by a shark and you rolled around on the beach and people were touching you, and um, you know they're teenagers and lifeguards and stuff like that, and they're all dirty and you might get an infection from it. That seems like it could be the least of your worries. But can you imagine though, like surviving the sharks pipe and then dying from an infection from it, especially in this day, and it's very sad. Okay, So, um, we've got the We talked about the three deadliest types of sharks, um, the tiger, the bowl and the great white. Well there's a reason, um, And they're actually like they kind of fly in the face of the idea that they're deadly because they want to kill you and your whole family and they would come into your house at night if they could, which is the prevalent view of sharks, where it wasn't at least until about five years ago. But these things are extremely widespread. You can find them all over the world. Um. They're big enough so that a human, which is a pretty good sized animal itself ourselves, um, can look like prey, which is something they're interested in. Um. They're powerful enough that that initial test bite can kill you. Even though the shark was like, oh this is gross, like a little reef shark, You're gonna have a little bit of troubles, but you know, you could probably get over that. I think the worst thing that can happen to you underwater, besides losing your life, is one of those little fish swimming into your urethra. What yeah, that happens? What? Yes, all right, I'll show you later man. Really yeah, man, in the I believe the Amazon. What does it do exactly what I just said? Yeah, but I mean after that feeds, once it's in there, it feeds. Good lord. So the other, the other um factor that makes those three the deadliest sharks is that they're at the top of the food chain, which means that they're not afraid of humans. If it knows you're a human, it's not going to be like, oh god, human, It'll be like, you know, want to feel a little hiky today. Uh So those are the why those three are the most dangerous. But like we said, um, hammer heads, makos, nurse sharks, reef sharks, black tips, they can all bite when threatened or by mistake. It happens. Um. I remember when we swam in the Georgia Aquarium, hammer head sharks were in there, and I wasn't super worried because people do this all the time, but it's still at one point I did look down and see that hammer head shark, you know, ten feet from me, and think, all right, well, there's a shark, and this is as close as I've ever been to one, and it is so weird looking. Actually, not as close as as someone in a wave when one time when I was in the ocean. No, just a shark like jetting through a wave that was crashing over me and he just flew by. I saw, like the silhouette. The wave is like Nature's aquai. Yeah, And I told the guy the lifeguard was like, dude, I just saw a shark, like really close to me. He said, how big was it? Said? About three ft long. He's like, what was he doing? Said, he sort of just surfing through the wave. He's like it's fine. He's like, we see him out here all the time. And he was probably saying it's fine because the shark was probably long gone by the time you talked to the lifeguard. It's a good point. They don't like to stay in one place for very long. And there's even a school of thought that multiple shark attacks in the location are not the result of a single shark. They are pretty much coincidence or there's something that's going on around there that we're not aware of that's attracting sharks. But it's not just one shark a rogue shark, and I just made air quotes which may or may not exist. Yeah, that's that. They have a couple of shark myths in this article and the the human um I desire human flesh rogue shark they think, I mean, they can't prove that that is not the case, but they certainly think that's de only not in the case. You know, like they can't say there are no rogue sharks anywhere. Um, but it's it's not like it is in the movies where there's like this one shark named Jaws and he just loves people and he loves hanging out in the same spot and just feeding on folks because idiots, Yeah keep coming out here. Why wouldn't they. But they do do weird things, um like go way out of their range, like as far north as New England or way upriver to like Chicago. Um, that's crazy. And they said if a shark was like sicker injured, you might could get some pretty unpredictable behaviors. Well that's truth. Any a cow, you don't want to be around a sicker injured cow. You know, it's just sad. It's a big animal and you don't it could do damage to you. Um, So shark at text. Like we said, there there are statistics and actually the University of Florida is the keeper of shark attacks statistics. Yeah yeah, um, which is just like boo, I know. Um, but there's between thirty and fifty unprovoked attacks every year worldwide, worldwide, the United States, um has the most. Typically in Florida has the most. So Florida is the shark attack capital of the world. But even still we're talking about thirty seven a year maybe, and that's at the top end. Yeah, ten to thirty seven. And millions and millions of people go to these beaches. But uh, these statistics show that shark attacks are increasing, and it's because of what you're just saying. Millions of millions of people go to these beaches, and more people are going to the beaches, so they don't think that sharks are getting any more aggressive. There's just more people out on the ocean. Makes sense, It does make sense, um, And there's this is kind of supported in a certain way by um. If you look at San Francisco, right, there's tons of sea lions or sea lion habitats in San Francisco, which means there's tons of great white sharks in San Francisco, but there's not a tremendous amount of shark attacks in San Francisco because people stay away from the sea lions. Yeah, and I don't think San Francisco Bay is like not a lot of people are swimming in that on a regular basis. That's true too. That's the other way you can look at it is be like, well, nobody's getting in there, so how can there be shark attacks? Plus, people in San Francisco is smarter than most people. But that kind of that raises Ah, that raises a pretty good point if you ask me, Like when you look at shark statistics, when you hear about a shark attack in the media, it's just by nature, it's sensational um And the author of this article of The Grabster took pains to point out that there's this thing that happens when something sensational is reported in the media, it becomes it seems to be much more prevalent than it actually is. What that's called an availability heuristic, and that's basically surmising that something is prevalent or around or exists just based on limited available data. Rather than all of the facts. So a pretty good example is like this idea that, um, you are more likely to be struck by lightning, it could be attacked by a shark. But the thing is is, if you are anywhere or a thunderstorm is you can be struck by lightning, But you have to go to the ocean to be attacked by a shark. That's a terrible comparison. It is if like my grandmother went to the ocean for the first time when she was like in her eighties, the probability of her dying from a shark attack was zero exactly. She never touched the water. But have she had your grandmother read a newspaper report about a shark attack, she probably felt like that was a threat to her even though she had a zero chance of being attacked by a shark. Or if my grandmother was a surfer in Florida, a that would have been pretty cool and be um heard. Chances of a shark attack would be much greater than like dying from a coconut hitting your head, which apparently does not happen ahead and spill the beans there. Well, that's another shark myth that one of the media reports shark attack frequency is often compared to death by coconuts dropping from trees. I've heard that. Everyone's heard that, right, I had not heard that. One haven't heard that. Um. I think they knew it was so asinine they didn't try that out on me. Um. But the apparently there's out of all reports of coconut injuries, there's never been a coconut fatality. And there's like been maybe a couple of reported coconut injuries, not a year like ever. So the this whole statistic about coconut deaths is totally made up, urban legend, totally urban legend. But the point is is that yes, there are sharks out there. Most likely they're not going to attack you. But if you are in the ocean where sharks are, your chances of being attacked are increased. Just take some precautions if you are a salt life person, assault life person. Uh. Plus, we should also point out that even if you do get attacked, chances are you going to live? Like, how many fatalities out of the out of the provoked the taxis year, ten are fatal that's statistics five to ten statistically speaking to five to ten worldwide a year people die from shark attacks. That's way, way low. And another another way to point this out to um about how there's lies, damn lies and statistics is that most shark attacks take place, you know, in shore, within a hundred yards of shore, Like you were saying, it's because it's where everybody is sure, Like if everybody swam two hundred yards off shore, maybe there'll be more shark at texts, maybe there'll be fewer. We don't really know because this is all very limited data. Well, yeah, they're really hard to study in the wild. Like, as much as we know about sharks, there's a lot we don't know, alright, So we tell people how to not get bitten by sharks. They recommend the experts don't swim at donn or dusk. They feed more and the water might be a little harder to tell what you are during the dimly lit hours. For the same reason, you shouldn't swim in murky water. Yes, and don't just stay out of murky water. That's my advice really, because there's a lot of murky water out there. Yeah, but why do you want to get in it when there's nice, clean, clear water. Not all of us have the time or the money to go to like sugar beaches. Chuck. Okay, don't swim with open cuts and some people say even menstruating uh women probably shouldn't swim the ocean. Yes, that might be taken a little too far, but avoid sandbars and sea mountains and drop offs because this is where you're gonna find a lot of wildlife marine wildlife, which might mean there might be sharks nearby. It definitely means the sharks don't wear contrasting colors. This can confuse the shark, and a confused shark is not good to be around. That's just um, contrasting but really bright ones to remember beachwear. Man, I know, um, I remember when we were training to Scooba Dive, my sister of my dad and I. The guy was talking about how sharks love really bright colors and like it's almost impossible to find like a black bathing suit, right, Um they call it yellby yellow. Yellows called Yebby yellow because apparently sharks like that one more than others. I'm looking for some some tope swim trunks. Can you help me out here? Some drab all of green, really short ones. Um, don't wear shiny jewelry. Uh, you shouldn't have your jewelry in the ocean anyway, if you asked me. But that reflection can like might look alluring to a shark. You never know, which is why you want this is swimming bricky water. That's a good point. Don't swim with a bunch of sea lions and seals. Pretty brainless right there, don't you think. Yeah, totally. I'm surprised that was even on the list. Don't thrash around. I think even in the movie Jaws, they talked about how that kind of thrashing and splashing that you get on the fourth of July as might attract sharks. So don't listen to thresh metal in the water. Um, I don't think you're safe just because you're like knee deep in water. Yeah, those bullsharks like shallow water and they're aggressive, So yeah, just be terrified in shallow water too. And finally, if you're fishing while in the ocean, like standing up to your waist, don't have your bait and a little sack tied to your waist floating there next to you. That's a bad idea. You want to keep your bait out of the water. You want to keep it. And I would imagine some sort of drift drift or drip proof container so that there's no blood just dripping into the water right in the water. Yeah, uh and um. Even if you're taking those precautions, you don't want to stay in the same place or too long. Yeah, I would fish from the beach. That wasn't the last when The last bit of advice is don't swim when there are sharks of the water. Yeah, because you can see them sometimes. Yeah, And if you do see them, don't go swimming. That's what I would do too. But if you're ever in a shark attack, fight back. People who punched them shark in the old ampule a um, or bite the shark, or head butt the shark, or do anything they can to beat the shark up have been successful in chasing sharks off. Especially I get the impression great whites are kind of wosses. That's grabs. Are called them whimps, like they don't they don't like to fight back, all right, I guess they don't like to get punched in the ampule of Lonncini. So I guess since we mentioned jaws a few times, we should finish up with the famous um Jaws effect as it's known, which was a big deal in with the book first UM and then the movie about a people being scared of the ocean for the first time and be uh, these rich jerks all of a sudden going out with high tech equipment and like killing as many sharks as they can just so they can have a big jaw to hang on their walls. They had like whole trophy UM tournaments, Yeah, called monster fishing, I think is what it was called, where you're just catching kill as many sharks as you could. And they still have these tournaments. They're all that catch a release now. UM. But before there it was unfettered sharks slaughter. UM, because directly because of Jaws. Yeah, and so much so that I think Peter Benchley even UM expressed regret later on that something he wrote, you know, led to this like slaughter of these innocent animals. He actually became a conservationist. I'm not surprised. I wonder what Spielberg thinks about all that. UM. I don't know, but you did find this article written by a marine biologist, UM who said, yes, this is true. Jaws did have this terrible act, but it also had a verily positive effect, and that it totally opened people's eyes to sharks period, and even the ensuing slaughter that came afterward woke the shark community people who were studying sharks up and said, whoa, whoa, We don't know enough about these animals for everybody to be running around killing them. We need more funding. So funding went into it because there was public interest, and there was a whole generation of shark biologists that were inspired to become shark biologists thanks to Matt Hooper. Yeah, and this guy himself said that he wanted to be Matt Hooper. This like the only guy in Jaws that was like really smart and really knew a lot about what he was doing. Like Brody obviously was a sympathetic character, but he didn't dream. He didn't even like being in the water. But Hooper comes along and with a shot classes and his beard and all his high tech equipment. The shark shark You go on the cage plage, goes in the water. Sharks in the water. So great. Hey, Plus he looks so cool with his rolled up jeans and his blue kads. Go Matt Hooper, what a great money. If you want to learn more about sharks. We have a ton of stuff out of this site.
