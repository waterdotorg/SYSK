Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know fromhouse stuff works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles to Be, Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry over there, And there are six feet in this studio right now, and all of them are exactly where they're supposed to be attached to their lowered legs. Yeah, below the calf, Yeah, yep, above the floor, facing forward to you, right. Yeah, that's a big one too, because if it's facing backwards, you've got problems or you're just going the wrong way all day long, maybe some Um do you know where they're not supposed to be Chuck feet? Uh, well, they're not supposed to be on the armrest of the seat in front of you on an airplane, yes, or a movie theater yes, But I know you're not talking about common courtesies. That bug me. No, but I agree with you wholeheartedly. That is so wrong. And um, I meant to tell you, I'm on, I've come over to your side about taking shoes off on the plane. It's okay if I do it, but um, you mean and I were flying somewhere and this dude behind his head, nasty stinky feet, and he had his shoes off, and like we're facing forward and we could smell his feet but low our seats behind us. And I kept turning around giving him the dirtiest looks, and he was like, you had no idea what I was doing. Did you look at his feet and then and he still didn't get it? Did you look at his feet his face and then clamp your head. I think that still didn't work. I threw up a little bit onto him. He just thought it was Yeah. I know. People disagree with me. People wrote in We're like, what's it to you? I thought it was to eat your own to eat your own chuck. Yeah, yeah, all right, So I'll tell you a place where feet aren't supposed to be. They're not supposed to be off on their own, on a beach somewhere, not attached to a body exactly. No, No, that's not something that you see every day, No, unless you're in Vancouver, and then it happens like almost every day. It seems like not quite, but sure, there's something very weird going on in Vancouver. You say there's no mystery. I said, there's still a bit of a mystery to it. But well, well, we'll start at the beginning. Okay, August two thousand seven. It's kind of a cool and drizzly day at a place called Jedediah Island Provincial Park up in British Columbia, right near Vancouver, right lovely. Sure, of course, that's why you would want to say, like go park or camp at this park with your family, which is what a twelve year old girl was you. And I I couldn't find this girl's name to save my life, probably because she's twelve. She wouldn't be good to say it. Anyway, she was sure. She was walking along the beach with her dad, and um, there was a bunch of like flots them, you know, that's the term for stuff that washes up from the sea, that the sea spits up onto the shores. And um, she saw a shoe and she picked it up, and she untied it and turned it upside down and out fell a sock, and inside the sock was a human foot yep, and she was pretty surprised, size twelve. Yeah, it was a campus brand shoe, which h ended up being not neither here nor there, but it is manufactured in India, mostly sold in India. Um, and we'll just park that right there for now. Yeah. So the families like this is unusual. Sure. Uh. They borrowed a radio from somebody else and they alerted the authorities, and in very short order, the Mounties showed up, the coroner showed up, the coast guards showed up. I bet the Mounties were all over that foot. Um. So yeah, they said, you know what, well, we're gonna take that foot is if that's okay little girl, And she, through her sobbing tears, said sure, but just give me a little money, okay. Uh. And they said we're gonna send it off for DNA examination, and um that did that return nothing the DNA as far as I know, Yeah, there was no there's no match. So that wasn't like a clue the d NA. No, but it was the first thing they tried the DNA. They also looked at it to see what was going on with the foot if if there was any kind of signs of what the deal was. Yeah, they held it up to their ear and pretended like it was a telephone. And one of the other mount he said, that's not funny. But they're like, oh, it is kind of funny, and they said sorry. So um, they didn't. They just kind of filed it away. It actually didn't make much of a stir outside of the area. It was worth talking about. It got a little bit in because it was just so weird. But they put the foot away and at the coroner's office and everybody went about their lives, right, I would assume so. And then six days later, other foot showed up in the area, not the same place, but in the same in the same general area, another right foot, which means it wasn't for the person's other foot. Now that'd be weird. So there's two people missing feet. Now. Yes, this is a men's Reebok size eleven, I think. And the people who found it said that when they saw it, they immediately knew that there was a foot in there because it looked full. It looks pretty how they is how they put it full of foot? Yeah, And they picked it up and smelled it and they're like, yeah, it's a foot, that's right. And the mountains came in again and they got off their horses and uh, Corporal Gary Cox said, you know, it is a little weird to find two feet, especially within six days of one another. Yeah, in the same area. It was Um, he described it as a million to one odds. I don't think he did the science on that, but it's just something you say. But he said too is pretty crazy, Yeah, and I agree with him. Yeah. So the first foot was in on Jedediah Island. The second ones on Gabriela Island, which is I couldn't find exactly how far away it was across the water, but it's it's not that far. They're close, but they're separated by some water. Um, and they're now all of a sudden, there's two feet that were found within six days. The media starts to catch drift of this one. Right, there's feet uh shoe defeat washing up on the shores in Vancouver. And at the time, at that very time, UM, Robert Picton was on trial in Vancouver for um murdering as many as forty nine women. You've heard to him, right, I think so. He was the notorious pig farmer who would like butcher women and feed them to his pigs, and then butcher's pigs and feed pigs to his guests. Yeah. One of the only probably Canadian serial killers, right, Yeah, and one of the worst of all serial killers. He was a horrible horrible person because he wasn't crazy, you know what I mean, he was just a just a horrible person. Um. And so he's on trial at that time, got I think twenty five years, which is like the maximum sentence you can get in Canada, what come on Canada years for for up to forty nine horrible murders. Um. So he was on trial. There are also a lot of like really high profile missing people in the area too, that it just vanished without a trace in the four years leading up to that. Yeah, and you point out because you wrote this, I did, But actually I was pointing out that Christopher Solomon pointed something. Okay, well the point is, uh, and this is a little strange, but maybe not. I don't know. I was trying to make sense of it. British Columbia apparently just has a higher than normal rate of missing persons than other parts of the world, which is weird. Yeah, but I mean like a lot more, yeah, more than people over a fifty nine year period. And uh. Solomon compared that to Kentucky, which is about the same size and population or same size population, they only had five and fifteen people missing over that fifty nine years. That seemed really low to med eight people a year missing in the whole state like that remained missing, Okay, unsolved forever, yes, because in Kentucky they'll just be like he was Uncle Billy's on the road for a week, right exactly. So like the the the idea is that BC has almost five times the number of unsolved missing persons cases over this fifty nine period compared to Kentucky, which has about the same size population. It's a lot more. Yeah, And I mean Solomon might have gone in and selected like, oh, Kentucky's got the lowest of the same size population, so that will really point it out. But it does seem that BC has a large amount of missing persons now, uh, I bet it has something to do with the terrain and the wildlife, probably the abundance of water. Probably that too. It's not a good good thing. A lot of heroin, yeah, you know, sadly and probably go missing, you know. In addition to the serial killer theory, one of them was that these were like people who would either run a foul of the local organized crime syndicates or um ran a foul of like a fellow heroin organized crime exactly disorganized. Remember that movie what movie Disorganized Crime? Was that a movie with Who's the the Dude the Blonde Dude from l A. Law Corton Burnson. Yes, it's actually a good movie. Really, I haven't seen Mark in a couple of decades. Hey, Summer School is one of the all time greats. Man, it sounds like that kind of movie Disorganized Crime, like a bunch of bumbling at criminals. Definitely, But I think like or Fred Gwynn was in it, Herman Munster, one of his last roles. All right, so you talked about theories. One of the other theories, remember we mentioned India manufactured that first shoe. Some people said, you know what, this is, sadly just feat of tsunami survivors from the Indian Ocean disaster December two thousand four, and they just years later these like body parts are washing up on shore, which is sort of plausible. It is. I mean, two fifty people died in that tsunami, A lot, if not most of them were never found. Yeah. Also we had people point out remember when we said that modern disaster flicks are bad. Uh, we had a bunch of people right in say The Impossible it was a great movie. That's the one about Yeah, and it was great, it was awesome. But I think that's different because that was a uh factual Uh, it's about a factual event. But and I categorize it as a disaster now. See, I don't categorize it as that because it was a real thing that happened. Like disaster flicks to me are when you know, when you invent some crazy disaster. Well okay, well let me ask you this. If it were totally fictionalized but the exact same movie, would you then can considered as a disaster flick? Yes, okay, so it's like on that scale and everything too. I had the impression it was much more just like a human interest. Well it became that. But they sho film the tsunami like it's it's not amazing how realistic. It is. Very very tough movie, very hard to watch. Have you seen Twelve Years of Slave yet? I still cannot bring myself to watch that. It's pretty rough. It's just staring at me on my DVR every night. I'm gona it'll be soon. I'll let you know. Okay, I'll just come into work crying. Okay, what did I do? Alright? So the tsunami disaster they said, um, might have been one of the reasons. But um, I think other people said, you know, maybe that's not the best explanation. Other people said, well, a lot of people just go missing from other things, like planes go down in the Salish Sea, which is the body of water between I think Vancouver Island and mainland British columb to you, which is where most of these were found? Is it Sailish? I think so, But we'll hear from Canadians one way or the other. You say Sailish, I say Salish. Who's right? Really? You know? All right, well, let's we're getting all excited here with these theories. But there were more feet to come, and we'll get back to those feet right after this, So chuck. The When those first two feet were found within six days, made the rounds, people talked about it, and then it just kind of drifted out of the news, right like a foot in the ocean exactly. Um. And then a third foot was found, and it came roaring back because this is yet another foot, a totally different one. This is a woman's foot actually a new balance size seven I think, and Kirkland Island, same general area right right, the same forty mile stretch along that coastal area. And this is within ten months now five ft four people. Yeah, so, um, the the other new balanced sneaker was found. That was the fifth foot found. And then in between the Yeah, they matched the foot to the you know, I don't know if that's good or bad, but they found the guy's other foot, right, the the woman that was the woman that they they found her two ft yes, so her feet were number three and number five to turn up. And then in between an entirely different person's foot turned up, men's like size eleven Nike, I think so. Yeah, within within a ten month period, there were five feet belonging to four different people that turned up on this little stretch. That's right, that's significant. Then there was a six foot the next August. This was in actually in Washington, so I guess it had its h hey as in order and made its way to the States. And so, like you said, if you're following the story at home as it's going on, you're starting to think, like, if I go to the beach, I'm going to see a foot today. And a lot of people did do that. A lot of people around British Columbias started looking for disembodied feet. They were turning up so frequently and I misspoke, you were right. So the seventh foot to turn up was the woman's other foot. That's hard to keep track, it really is. So how many feet in total, sir? I think the last two were found February of this year. Yeah, and they actually belonged to the same person. But they were found a week or two or so apart. And I say last, I mean most recent. I'm sure more feet will come. It seems that way because between so the first foot was found in August two thousand and seven, these most recent feet were found in February two thousand sixteen. That total seventeen disembodied feet found within a hundred and fifty miles stretch between Tacoma, Washington and British Columbia. That's unusual, it seems like it, and there's a lot of theories, but no one can say definitively here's what's going on, right uh, And I know we're making a lot of jokes. I realized these feet belonged to people who are no longer with us. I just want to throw that out there that we do a lot of comedy on this show, so we did a coma episode that had jokes. I mean, come on, I just wanted to see away there. Uh. So from the beginning, the cops and the Mounties were basically like, I don't you know, this seems really fishy. Uh, but it's not. We don't think it's murder. We don't think there's someone out there killing people and chopping their feet off, which is what a lot of people thought. Yeah. But and notably because their feet weren't cut off, and you can tell right they were, They said that they were naturally disarticulated, right, that's right. Um. So that first foot that that girl found on Jedediah Island was identified pretty quickly because the cops released a pick sure of the shoe to the media. And remember it was a Campus brand which has made in India, sold mostly in India. And so the guy whose foot it was, his family saw it on the news and identified him as somebody who he was a longtime suffer of depression and he was in a depressed state when his family last saw him. So the cops came to the logical conclusion that he had killed himself. So foot number one has been matched to a missing person case. Clothes right, that's right. Uh. So then the new balance shoes turned up on separate islands. Uh, this is the woman and she was identified as a lady who also was suffering from depression and jumped off a bridge. I think they knew this for sure. Yes, that's where the woman was last seen, was jumping off a bridge. Yeah, this has been four years previous. So now they're starting to get a pattern here where all right, there was another man to the one on Valdi's Island feet three and five. Uh, they determined either suicide or accident. And then another couple of people who were accidentally killed. And so they see this pattern now, all right, these are people that just happened to die or die by their own hand, um near enough to the water where their feet were there. Yes, I'm just being vague for now, right, Yeah. But the weird thing is is now, all of a sudden, in a very short period of time, relatively short period of time. Um, I mean because one of these guys whose feet turned up was last seen after his boat turned over. So in a very short period of time, all these people who died at very different periods of time, suddenly their feet were starting to turn up in this area around the stylish sailorsh Sea. Yes, um and the cops had a I guess, kind of a pretty good idea from the outset. But to understand what was going on, or at least what the cops say was going on, you have to understand what happened to a UM. A person who dies in the water. You think that people float, you know, yeah, you kind of think that because in movies that you know, if you're trying to get rid of a body in the water, you always you know, ty cement blocks to a submit shoes is the old joke. You know, somebody turned up like that in New York recently, like with submit shoes, not too many movies. But the idea is that you have to weight the body down. And I suppose if you were going to get rid of a body that I'd probably do the same thing, just out of you know, just cover my basis, just to be sure. Well, the thing is, if you do you cebment shoes on a person, you should never do that, you know. But if you did, um, what you're doing is you're not ensuring that they sink, right, then you're ensuring that they don't come back up because that's what happens. That's right, body that has gone unconscious or has drowned and died, Um sinks pretty quickly. And it it usually sinks so quick that if you are looking for a drowning victim, you you should look on the bottom pretty close to where they were last seen on the surface. They sink that fast. Man. So a body sinks, um, and it will sink faster and fresh water than saltwater because saltwaters makes humans a little more buoyant. Um. I guess overweight people, people with a lot of fat on their bodies sink uh more slowly than people who are leaner. Um. And then depending on the water temperature as well, um, and how deep the water is, they'll sink faster and faster as they get to the bottom. Yea. And depending on what you're wearing, yeah, like a code or shoes or something like that, or a backpack. It's it's definitely gonna pull you down. But the point is once you go under, once you submerge and you're dead or you're dying, Um, you're gonna sink pretty quick. Yeah, there's more pressure to the deeper you get in the body of water. Uh. You mentioned the temperature was lower, but there's also more pressure. That compressed is the air in your body, and that's gonna make you less floaty as well. So the thing the cool air or the cool temperature does down there is it uh kind of preserves you for a little while, longer than ordinarily because um, the bacteria that will eventually consume your body or just gonna be slower do so they just move more slowly. But that bacteria is eventually gonna overcome the sinking of the body because your body is an enclosed system generally roughly, I mean, you've got a mouth and all that, you know, But as they're eating, they're putting out as a waste product, um, gases like methane and stuff like that. UM, and your body traps that stuff and it begins to bloat. And I'm everyone knows that once you bloat, you float. That's right, that's the forensics bumper sticker. Yeah, eventually you're going to rise to the top like a dirigible because those gases that are trapped in your body or like like a submarine. I guess do you mean they keep going into the air like you float off and then your foot will be found on the moon later. Uh, yeah, you're gonna float. And that's why whenever they people discover like a dead body in a lake much later, it's you know, it's not a pretty thing. They're they're bloated and and puffed out and decomposed. It's not pretty. But if you are UM, if you're trapped, say like in a vehicle or something like that, and all of this takes place, UM, eventually your your body is going to be prevented from floating away and it will eventually rupture. And once the rupture happens, all that gas and the um, the buoyancy that's created by it is all released, and you're staying there. You're staying there. And I read this article about UM. Did you read the article about the Oklahoma guy? Huh? Yeah, it was really weird. Is so like the guy? There was a guy who was um, whose brother went missing in his Camaro and I think like nineteen seventy and he um, he just never knew what happened to him, and he used this boat ramp on this place called Fosse Lake, and he found out later when the cops accidentally discovered the car that his brother had been submerged in. Just twelve feet of water for forty years. All those times he was back in his boat into False Lake. His brother was right below him, and they found him accidentally. And then they found another car that had gone missing I think the year before, just a few feet away. And the moral of the story is that False Lake is really murky. I mean twelve ft of water, two different cars, Camaro, Camaro, and I think like a packer or something like that, or buick Man. Unbelievable. Uh all right, well let's take another little break here and we'll talk a little bit more about what can happen to a body under water and uh, what's the deal with all these feet? All right? Uh, just this year there was a study there's some criminologists at Simon Fraser, you outside of Vancouver, and there have been a bunch of studies like this over the years where they we've talked to, you know, in our Body Farm episode, where criminologists and forensics experts try to see what happens to bodies under various conditions, including being sunk underwater. Uh So they took a pig carcass in this case, not a human cadaver, and they sunk it kind of nearer where uh in the sailors Sea where these feet had been appearing, and um, this these pigs carcasses were um, they were bones in a matter of days. It was really really fast. Yeah, they were really surprised, surprisingly fast because you know, conventional wisdom is that this took weeks months maybe even and the other studies have shown that right, and these things, these pigs were like just bones in a few days. Um. They think it's possible that the sailor c is um an anomaly because this was an almost a thousand feet of water, but it's really highly oxygenated, so there's a lot of life down there, um, a lot more things to eat a body exactly, Whereas if you took it to another body of water and a thousand feet there, there might not be as much oxygen, so it might take longer. But for the sailors c, it's possible for something to be reduced to bones in a few days. Yeah. Here was my one problem with the way they did this study. Maybe I overthought it, but they trapped it under fencing, um, which presumably means that that was just you know, kind of in one place the whole time. I would have like, if you're going to stimulate a hum and body, I would have uh maybe shackled a leg and and put a long leader a hundred so it could move around and see what the Yeah, because a body can move on the bottom a little because there's currents, you know. But yeah, have you seen did you see the video of it? The time elapse video. It's really something. It's gross. I don't need it. So um there was another study that I found that really kind of um ties all this together. It was from and it was carried out by the corner of King's County, which is where Seattle is, and um, he or she I think it was he. Um looked at bodies that have been pulled from the water, and he took the amount of time they've been in the water submerged, and then uh, the amount of body parts that were left or exactly what body parts are left, and basically went act and reverse engineered the process by which a body comes apart when it submerged underwater. That's valuable information, it really is, you know. And so what they what they came up with was that the the skin, the thinnest areas of skin typically cover like joints like your wrist and ankles does get eaten away first, which exposes that soft tissue beneath that holds your hand to your arm or your foot to your leg, and then that gets attacked by scavengers and all the other stuff that's eating it. And so between the things eating that soft tissue holding the bone together and the wave action of the currents at the bottom of the body of water, the hands and then the feet work loose, they disarticulate, so they naturally will fall off the body as the body is decomposing, submerged underwater, and they are among the first parts to go. That's right. And if you're just a foot and you're not wearing a shoe, um, then chances are that foot will get consumed and you will never see it again. Although one of these feet was a barefoot correct, which seems to be a little bit of an outlier, a little bit. But if you've got a shoe on that thing that's tied up nice and tight, and you're disarticulated at the ankle, that foot is still inside that shoe, gonna make it really hard for a scavenger to get in there. And it's very possible that that foot will not decomposed or at least decomposed very slowly. Right, And not only that, will it be protected once it disarticulates. If it's wearing a certain kind of shoe, specifically an athletic shoe that's made in the last like, uh twenty years. Uh, it's gonna have air injected into the soul. And in the case of like remember Nike air max Is, they had actual air pockets like in the in between the soul and the bottom of the shoe, and that actually creates a buoyant effect that will lift a shoe, including one that has a foot still inside, to the surface. Yeah. So they started looking all these cases and they said, well, almost all of these are athletic shoes, so that makes sense. And it's gonna bob upside down because of that rubbery soul, so it's gonna be protected even more from birds and things. So what we have here is a case of people that just happened to die and their feet happen to come away from their bodies and be well protected by these awesome running shoes and eventually made their ways to shore. Um. But a little bit weird that they would happen in this area in such a span of time, I would still say, right, that's a that's to me the um and and we should say that's what you just said, that's the cops position. And it has been basically since the outset, since the first foot was found. Basically nothing to see here and there's not a lot there to um to undermine it, yeah, or attack it like it's a pretty sound position, but there is still a mystery to it to me, and that why British Columbia like it. It doesn't make sense. And there's a couple of explanations. One is that the Sailors Sea is something like a lagoon to where water flows in from the Pacific Ocean from the south northward into the Sailors Sea, and once stuff goes in there, it basically recirculates. It doesn't come back out very often. Well that when you see the sign that says sailor see it says feete flow in, they don't flow out exactly right, So once you see that sign, you're like, well, there's the explanation. Um. The idea is that the Sailor Sea would experience higher incidents of flots some of all types, including feet, which is one explanation it could be right, Well, I'm sure that has something to do with it. Sure. The other explanation is um, one of my favorite things in the world, which is a version of uh. Well, there's a couple of names for it. UM. There was a guy named Arnold's Wicky Uh in two thousand six and linguistics per fessor at Stanford who coined the term frequency illusion UH. And that's one of the cognitive biases. UM. We're basically if you are looking for something, you're gonna find it. All these people saw in the news feet washing up on the shore, so like you said, they all started looking for feet, and every time a foot was found, it just supported the idea that yes, there's something really weird going on here, which only increased the awareness and the focus on this, which means that people started seeing more and more feet. That's right. So frequency illusions specifically is a mix of selective attention and confirmation bias. So in this case, selective attention unconsciously keeping an eye out for that new thing that you were just told about, which is the feat uh. And the confirmation bias in this case is the reassurance that it's just proof more and more proof of its omnipresence more feet you could see that happening here for sure. Pretty interesting. It's called the bottom line Huff phenomenon too. Yeah. I didn't know where that came from those ad until I looked it up. It was just a comment or on a on the Pioneer Press of St. Paul discussion board. And he had heard about the bottom mine HAFF terrorist group a couple of times and one day and for the first time, yeah, and just said, you know, bottom MINEHFF phenomenon, and it became a meme. I thought it was more. I don't. I thought it was cooler than that. I thought there was some cool explanation that wasn't just some dude online. It definitely sounds cooler than it is. It sounds way cooler than it is. But it's a common thing and people, Uh, you talk about eleven eleven on the clock is a big one for a lot of people say, you know, I see eleven eleven all the time in the clock. It's because you're looking for it. Sure frequency illusion. Yeah, it's not actually happening more than it ever was. You know, you're just paying more attention to it now. And this is a really, really unnerving suggestion, man, because it's it says that feet washing up on the shore is way more common then, and of us realizing that if you went over and picked up an athletics shoe on a beach somewhere, there's a good chance that there's going to be a foot inside. We just aren't aware of this as as human beings and outside of Vancouver, right, So that makes Vancouver the capital of the disembodied, the disembodied feat capital of the world. I don't know that that necessarily holds up, though. I don't think it's being to explain, yeah, because I mean, I bet, I bet you it's frequency illusion. I I disagree. I think it's something else. I think it probably has to do with the hydrology or something about Vancouver or British Columbia. There's this some database called name US and it's like a catalog of unidentified remains, and I did a search for disarticulated foot and out of like forty thousand unidentified remains in the US, Vancouver the only three were disarticulated feet, and one was found in the Washington State area. So you could technically kind of included in that weird Vancouver clump. One was in Maryland and one was in Dallas. That was it. So it does really seem like Vancouver has a higher than usual incidents of this articulated feet showing up in its area. WOWI which is weird? Are you on the case? No? Not'm just a fan. So you got anything else? No, I just realized I've been like rotating my feet around and making sort of Uh. If you want to know more about this, um, you can. Actually, there are three really good articles that I read in addition to some other ones, but three stood out. One was by Winston Ross of The Daily Beast, one was on Pacific Standard I didn't see an author, and then Christomers Christopher Solomon's outside article. Those are all pretty stand out. Uh. And since I said stand out, it's time for a listener. Now I'm gonna call this Internet Roundup. I don't know if people watch, but we have an Internet show called Internet Roundup. Several people walk yeah, and it's like the silliest thing we do. We sit down in this studio on video and we just talked about a couple of things on the Internet that we think our neat. So that is a setup. Hey, guys, I was recently on a Delta plight and they show these on Delta, and this is not an advert Delta. I was recently on adults plight from Atlanta at Austin keeping an eye out for your hat, Chuck. I got very excited when I remembered I could watch your Internet Roundup show on the plane to pass the time. Because we began our descend in Austin, sudden thunderstorms developed. It was quite bumpy, to say the least. If you have never been on a plane that unsuccessfully tried to land in a thunderstorm, I don't recommend it. I just had listened to your How to Survive a Plane Crash episode from two thousand eight just that week before, and I remember thinking how grateful I was that I was in the back of the plane. Chuck said, I had a better chance of surviving that way. Uh, it's not much of a chance, but sure. I just thought you would like to know that despite the horrible weather going on, and never lost connection with your show. Uh, watching Internet round Up and able to listen and watch you guys really helped me keep calm until our pilot finally gave up trying to land and diverted the plane to Houston. That's even scarier. You know, I'm not gonna try anymore. Well, let's go to Houston close enough. Yeah. Uh. In the end, everyone made it to Austin safely though, So thanks for everything you guys do. And that is from Lauren Sprouse. Thanks a lot, Lauren. Um. Have you ever watched videos of planes that come in for a landing but it's too windy so they have to like immediately take back off? Now, this has never happened, like they touched down and take off. If you watch those waiting to get onto a plane, it's a really good way to poke at your brain. Wow. Yeah, no, thank you. Uh.
