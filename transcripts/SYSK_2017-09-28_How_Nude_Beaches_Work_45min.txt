Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w Chuck Bryan, There's Jerry. Uh. This is Stuff you Should Know, the totally new edition. Chris, are you're looking good? Well? I think you're sort of kidding. Only only time will tell you want to you want to break the news? Go ahead? Yeah, I lost another tooth. I didn't want to mention it. Uh So, here's the story because I know people were interested. Everybody likes this tooth saga yours in my dental bloes. It's riveting, but it also like people feel for you, you know, Yeah, I think so, and I think the Dennis and oral surgeons of our audience get a kick out of it. This is the thrilling part for them. Uh So, I was on Vaca and as you know, um, I love palms South Carolina. Um bought tons, well not tons, pounds and pounds of seafood to cook and was having a great week grilling fish and scallops and shrimp. Nice. Did you so you went to like the local seafood market. That's like just one big long encounter of seafood and it's super cold inside. And I love those places. There's always like a few bottles of Tony Cocheri's Creole seasoning. Oh, and all the local stuff like here's the crab boil in a ziplock that we make. Yes, I love those places there. Nothing makes a beach vacation more than a visit to the local seafood places, agreed. And I will even shout out Simon Seafood and Mount Pleasant Seafood. They're gonna send you a box of shrimp un refrigerating. Bought a box of one oysters while we were there, and we uh, we had oyster happy Hour every night, and I learned to shuck oysters like a pro nice um. And I made my own version of frog Moore stew one night. Can I come on vacation with you guys next time? We we do it right, man. I bought probably seven or eight pounds of shrimp, five or six pounds of scallops, stone crab claws, king crab claws, flounder, snapper, salmon, you name it. Dude, Did those guys have like a lean on your house? Now? No? I did spend a ton of money on the stuff. The other thing that we enjoyed was um the dips like crab shrimp dip and salmon dip. Anyway, everything speeding along. It's the final second to the last night. And I make my own version of frogmore stew, which is the low country boil basically of Charleston. Uh, and I bite. We have these Christini's that we baked. And you know, the one tooth that I've been saying is going to go. They got hurt in college and it's been loose for whatever twenty plus years, and I've been afraid that my daughter's going to kick it in one day, I was just like counting down. Uh that that clock. And I've been into a Christini, heard the felt the crack uh, and immediately was like there it goes. And Emily and my friends were like, no really, oh yeah, I know that. I know that crack that s It does suck if it hurt at all. Now it never hurts. Um. That is the one good thing. Like I finished my meal very gingerly eating on the you know, I've learned how to eat in the back of my mouth. Yeah, like a Neanderthal. Use your eyes like a frog. They just go inside your skull and push the food down, so and made an appointment the next day. I called around. It was like, do I go home that, Do I like tough out the rest of the vacation here and be stressed and go home and do it, which means I probably can't get until Friday. Or do I ruined part of a day, my final beach day doing this locally? Uh? And so I decided to go in and get it done there, and two hours out of my day was all I wasted. Oh wow, that's pretty pretty good, not bad. So big big shout out to apex Oral and uh Maxila, Maxima Facial Surgery and Janitorial Services of Mount Pleasant and Dr Charlotte's marvel She was great? Was she marvelous? She was? And you know, when I get it done here, I go under twilight sleep, which I don't feel a thing, and it messes me up. The whole rest of the day. I'm just groggying in bed. And I didn't want to do that. And I was like, I'd like to enjoy the beach and go out to dinner to night. We had reservations this great place on our final night, you know, the last night dinner out deal. And she said, well, I can just inject you and if you're okay with needles, and you know, I've long talked about the needle and the gums is the worst thing. And she said, well, this will also be needle in the roof of your mouth, and uh, I was like, all right, I gotta do it. And she stuck me in the roof of my mouth and my eyes just started running water and I literally said, I'm not crying, that's just a reaction. Uh. Yeah, it was fine. I mean it numbed it up so much. I didn't feel a thing. And it was kind of interesting being awake for once during this procedure of abstraction and bone what do you call it? Yeah, because now I've learned when they when they take out a tooth, Now the best practices are you immediately graph bone to it because you lose it so quickly. Pocket protection is what it's called. That's awesome. That is so nerdy awesome. I love it. But man, it is a rough procedure. They are so rough And now I know why they knock you out because they don't want you to know how rough they are with you. Yeah, felt like I was getting assaulted. Yeah. Yeah, they don't play Dennis don't play, And that's not the knock Dr Marvel. She did great. I mean you gotta get in there and do it, you know. So Anyway, I was literally on the beach two hours later with a Gin and Tonic. That's great. That is really great, good story story, had it all. Yeah, I had food surgery. Yeah, the beach, Dennis with a great name, the beach, Yeah, the whole thing. Uh. And also this also means for people coming to see us on tour for the remainder of the year. I'm not even bothering with a insert tooth, thank goodness, because I had to sit there with it right next to me staring at me during each show. Nah. I'm used to it by now. I'm just gonna bubba it up for the next nine months or whatever. They're gonna love it. We should start charging double for tickets thing. Um, So thank you for indulging that story. Well. It leads to a burning question that I've been trying to ask this whole time. Were you knew on the beach at any point? No, no, nude beach at Isle of Palm Huh No, I thought about during uh a nighttime ocean swim doing it. Uh. Poto grante. Is that how they say that? Yes, But then I thought, you know what, I'm being sort of brave swimming in the ocean at night anyway. Yeah, I'm not gonna have things exposed. There's something really creepy about swimming at night in the ocean, particularly agreed. But I did it and it's great. Yeah, it's really like I think that's part of the exhilaration is I don't know what's out here. Yeah, I guess as long as you say, and I don't care. I'm just gonna enjoy myself and it would be enjoyable. Yeah, but I did keep saying, but at least I've got my pants on. My pants Well, I did have pants on, ad tuxedo pants on, but there's a lot of at tuxedo pants on, as is per tradition at Isle of Palms to cover your junk from the sea turtles. Yeah, that's what you do, that you swim the beach and tux pants. Right, So this is that's almost the exact opposite then, of a traditional New beach, which is what we're talking about. Have you ever been to one? I have, Uh, there, No, I went and visited. I just went and looked for a second. Yeah no, But I wasn't like poking people with a stick or anything like that. Like I just wanted to see, like, okay, what is this? And I'll tell you. I'll tell you what really drew me over to look? Um you mean? And I were down in Florida and there's a there's a nude beach. It's a clothing optional and I believe unofficial nude beach at the Canaveral National Seashore there and uh, okay, yeah, that's right. We'll share our stories, okay. And um, like, we drove down at one point just just to kind of see, you know, and sure enough, there was a woman walking around just wearing shorts and that was it. Um. But what really got me to go check was we saw this girl who must have been seventeen or something and she was totally closed, like fully dressed, not even wearing like a swimsuit, She's just dressed. And she was coming back from the beach with her hand over her mouth and her eyes like the size of bread plates. And her mom was sitting there laughing at her, waiting at the car, watching her come back like this. And I was like, I gotta go to seat. So I went and looked, and I was like, yeah, there's a couple of naked people. Um, they're all dudes, and uh, well, I've seen the nude beach now. But at the same time, I was like, I would love to like just go nude in a nude beach. But the more I did this research tomorrow, I was like, I could take or leave it. I have no problem and probably would still like to like go nude at a very secluded nude beach. But I get the impression that public nude beaches and I don't even think I would enjoy like a nudist resort nude beach. It would have to just be like a remote, deserted island. Not because of any shame or anything like that, but because I just I think that that would be the way that I most enjoyed the experience of just being nude out there on the beach. You know what I mean, nude on the beach with just like you and your wife, right, and that's it, Yeah, you know, just hanging out. You want to own your own beach. I guess I think that's what I'm getting at. I'm hoping a wealthy listener will send US one. Uh so here's my experience with that very beach. Was that play Linda or Klondike? All right, So my deal was many years ago. I did a long, like three month out west trip with my best friend Brett, and we we started in Atlanta and said, all right, what's where should we go first? And this is pre internet and you know when you're doing book research. And I said, there's this place in Florida, your Canaveral that's called Klondike Beach. And I said, and I don't know if this is true, but what I read is that there is a law enforcement acuum there because no one if there's some overlap with counties, national land where there's a space where there's no law. Yeah, there's supposedly a place. And I think Yosemite National Park that's like that too. Well, yeah, I've heard that stupid story where you can like kill somebody and getting I don't think that true. Well, I don't know. I don't think this is they would remember reading the article and there they would get just you know, somehow. Um, but I think there wasn't like I think it wasn't no law, but there wasn't technically there was no legal overseer of this one area, and that was Klondike Beach, and there were you could there were hippie smoking weed and nudis, and I was like, that's where we should start. I have no idea what drew me, because you know, it wasn't like I was going for either one of those things. There's that sounds a bit like a place called Wreck Beach in Vancouver, where it's not like there's no jurisdiction or questionable jurisdiction, it's just really hard to get to. There's like four hundred steps down to the beach. So apparently the cops a long time ago said whatever, you guys can do whatever you want, we don't care. So not only is it a nude beach, it's like a drug adult um, drunken beach um. But apparently it's a lot of fun. But I supposedly they started cracking down on it recently and it's not as fun as it once was. Well, I do remember. Actually what drew me was you can you can camp on the beach there, which is sort of rare too. It wasn't a campground. There's like back country camping on the sand, uh, and there's not a ton of places in the States where you can do that. Yeah, that sounds kind of fun. Actually, it was waking up to the sound of waves like that. It's wonderful. Uh. And we did go down there and we did camp and it was a great way to start the trip, and we did There's this dude walked up to us this and of course I think this is usually the story this. You know, probably fifty something year old man but naked, walks up to us and just starts a conversation. Oh huh. So I got a lot of like differing advice from doing research on this. Yeah, well, how so the guy started a conversation with you, Um, what did you do? Did you go, hey, Bob, good to meet you. A nice penis like that Saturday Night Live sketch. No, I think we just tried to treat it like a normal conversation, which it was. The I guess what I've been hearing differing things on is that at nude beaches you will possibly be surprised by the standoffishness of the nude bathers. Um, you might be expecting free spirits like Bob, the guy you met, right, Yeah, I think the deal is and we will be corrected through listener mail. But I think if you are clothed, they may be a little more standoffish. But from what I understand, if you're not clothed, that's that's all kind of part of the community, and we should do a larger one on nudists. At some point I could not agree more. I I had an idea, but I had no idea how um lengthy and longstanding the the nu nudism movement is, or the naturism movement, I should say, yeah, naturalists, Like, from what I understand, there very much a community, and uh, that's the whole point is to normalize it to where it's just like talking on the beach with anybody, right, Like, it's not like any different than being clothed. And that's their whole bag is Hey, this is just this is how we come into the world, and we have all shamed each other with our bodies over the years to where we have clothed ourselves. And of course, I you know, me growing up, Southern Baptists have a very weird relationship with nudity, to the point where I'm like, yeah, man, like what's the big deal. Europeans have got it right, It's just your body who cares? And then the other half of me says, oh my god, put some clothes on. You know, do you want to go to Hell today? And it's not even that it's just I guess I'm kind of shy. Yeah, but I mean I'm sure it's it's ingrained shyness for sure, from from an upbringing like that. Um, so you you definitely hit on something, right. So when you're talking about the naturist movement, like if you go to a naturist resort, like a specific a nude beach that's part of a naturist resort where you have to say, be a member to get in or something like that, Um, yes, you're going to find people who are very happy that you're there, and they're very happy to be naked, and everybody's very happy that everyone's naked, right, Um, but you're also probably going to encounter something like compulsory uh, compulsory nudity where if you're there, you have to be naked. They don't want anybody coming along and be like, what's this all about? What are you guys doing over here? Shake your shake your money maker for me? You know, they're not into that, so they have to have. They have to have their own UM set aside resorts. It's like their own place. It's like a private area UM. But it's say like a different kind of beach, like a clothing optional beach, where it's a public beach that allows nudity but it isn't compulsory. That's when it seems to UM. It seems to be kind of like paradise lost for the naturists. Historically speaking, there definitely is yeah, and it seems like just about every country that has beaches has nude beaches, and if they are public nude beaches where clothing is optional, it seems like the naturists who are actually there to just enjoy being naked, it has nothing to do with sex. Their kids are running around naked, the whole families there. It's very family oriented. Naked beach UM tend to lose control of it because outside elements usually come in, start like partying, having public sex, and then all of a sudden, this nude beach gets a terrible reputation and the government steps in. Local people complain and usually when they do, it's successful, and the government steps in and nobody can be naked anymore, and it's ruined for all the naturists. Yeah, and that that is not the same thing at all as topless speeches that you find um in in Europe and in some places here in the United States. I went to one of those two, and I mean you call it topless speech, it was I think it was just a beach, you know. I think a lot of the beaches in europea topless. It's not like a big thing. And we saw, you know, ladies with their uh, with their no bikini top on. And of course, being a kid I was young, I was like, oh, hey, you're like that wolf. But I was respectful because I knew even then, like, you know, you don't want to ugle somebody because that's probably not too cool. But then even as a young guy, it normalized and I was like, oh, well that's just a body part. It ain't a big deal. Yeah. Yeah, that after you turn i don't know, nineteen or twenty, it's really easy to become desensitized to that kind of stuff, you know. So let's take a break. Man had a lot of good set up there. Yeah, that was a lot of set up ethan penises and all kinds of moves. The whole shebang. We'll be right back everybody. That's why Ska that you should know, why skin should know knows but Clarkin sk so Chuck, You've mentioned it a couple of times, and it seems like anybody who even basically knows about New Eaches tends to think of Europe. And for good reason too. There was a survey in two thousand and sixteen that surveyed I think like um ninety different countries or something like that was a pretty extensive survey to find out what the attitudes were towards nude sunbathing on public beaches, and they found that Austrians, the Austrians, I really would not have guessed the Austrians, and I'm not I'm not missed speaking Australians. I mean the people from Austria, I don't know. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't know. At any rate they're fine with nudism. They at the very least, I'm sure they have sandy lakes. They're fine with with nude sunbathing at the beach. Um Something like seventies six percent of Austrians say it's quote absolutely acceptable to sunbathe in the nude in public um. It used to be Germany was the was the champion of cool with nude some babe and their Paymoent's very famous shore line but they yes, and the North Sea, but they they fell the second place. German say it's absolutely acceptable, and you're sure it didn't say Australians right because they're waiting. Okay, yeah, I know. Well Australia has a has a um a roller coaster relationship with nude beaches. I think it depends on who's in charge of the culture at any given point in time. Yeah. Well maybe while we're there will be in charge of the culture for a short time. Nudity everywhere gets grossed out. Our shows are about to get raucous. You never know a nude show, how about that? So no, no, absolutely not. I mean the audience, not us. So I'm still not comfortable with that either. Well that's how they say. To the reason I say that is because to Live Cruise show they say, the picture of your audience in the nude. If you're nervous, I think they say underwear. Oh okay, gotcha, I remember that Brady Bunch. That's all I know. Uh oh, so I don't know Australians but I do know eight percent of Americans say it's absolutely acceptable to somebody in the news. That seems about right, pretty low percentage, that's what i'd figure. Well, you know who had an even lower percentage, UM, it's Italians. Italians say they are not okay with having somebody's somebay nude by them in on a public beach. It surprises me as well, but such as the way, but they're kind of an outlier as far as Europe goes. In Europe actually again have some of the earliest nude beaches around. UM. This article says that like the first one was in Bordeaux in France, that that um started around after World War Two. But I actually saw footage of a nude beach in Georgia, a country not the state from dating from the nineteen twenties. So as far as nudity goes, Georgia is even more progressive than France. Apparently. I don't know about progressive. I think sometimes it's just you know, freaks are gonna let their flag fly. No, you got it, you got it, And and if you've got a group of them together, I don't care. If it's nineteen twenty and Georgia then they find each other, they're gonna do it. I don't think that necessarily means that Georgia was super progressive, you know what I mean? Okay, I see what you mean. Or maybe it does. I don't know, but I'm just saying. And that's the case with these a lot of these nude beaches. Is it bears pointing out. Some of these are sanctioned and some of them are just have happened over the years to this extent where like you said, the local cops are just kind of like they're not hurting anybody. This is sort of where they gather and everyone knows that, so they can either choose to go there or stay away from there. And these places are are usually somewhat removed too. Not all the times, but usually, Like I remember with Klondike Beach, it wasn't that it wasn't like the main beach. You had to kind of work a bit to get there. Yep, it's almost always, if not remote as far as just beaches in general go, it is like the say, the northernmost part or the southernmost part, so it's secluded in some way, shape or form. I read this fascinating article about um a nude beach off of Palm Beach called air Force Beach, and it was a private island owned by John D. MacArthur of the famous John D. And Catherine Tine MacArthur. And he yeah, and he um made his billions selling insurance, I believe, and he uh I apparently was a bit of a naturist himself, but he had like he allowed people to use his beach and he also loud one of the sides of the beach to become a nude beach. And there was a big struggle because he died as he was signing over um or his son was signing over the deed to this beach to the county with the stipulation that this part remain nude, and he died before the nude part document was signed. So the county took the beach and was like, no, we're not going to and there's been a struggle ever since. I think that was in the nineties when he died um, but it was it was a a lost nude beach. But for a while there there was apparently something like five thousand people a day coming there to some bathe nude on the weekends. That was one of America's most populated nude beaches. And it was all because it was this old rich guy's um. He was okay with it. Didn't have that said. These penises are brought to in part by the John D. And Katherine Pete maccarthur Foundation. And you push a button and it's read by Ira Glass. Yeah. Actually I readn't read those DESI can you do it? Though? I think everyone wants to hear now, I don't think so. I've retired by iveryglass impression. Uh. The other thing with some of these beaches is um like sometimes they're so remote and removed. This it's just sand and you're on your own. Like they may not even have like trash cans and stuff. Other ones are a little more advanced and they might have activities. They might have a beach well, a toilet what do you call it, like a like a bath house, uh, in a shower or maybe they even serve booze. Um. But it bears pointing out that I don't I think a lot of Americans, and especially like more conservative in the kind of way I grew up, more conservative religious Americans might think that's just like a hedonistic sexual free for all with these weirdos, and that is generally not the case at all. It is a bunch of old people naked and talking to each other about, you know, whatever the economy, how the pitch are biting. Yeah, I don't think how the fish are biting, as long as it's not sea turtles, I guess, um. The the we can't really overstate that a genuine naturist nudists nude beach has nothing to do with sex. It might be a sensual experience to have, like you know, was one guy quoted in the article says, you know, like just being out there and feeling the breeze and feeling the water and all that, it's sensual. But this guy is talking about the senses, like like the tactile sense is just making him feel good. He's not saying like, you know, I got a giant erection right because of it. It's not about sex. And again, a lot of these places are more family friendly than even adjacent beaches. Yeah, and there is no shame in our bodies, and we respect to each other's bodies. I mean, they're probably the least or most open minded body type community on planet Earth, right, Yeah, you would think so, you know, like there's no body shaming and nudist communities that's the whole point because they all come together to accept where we all uh hang in and and wrinkle and all the things that happened to bodies over the years. It's sprout weird goat hairs. Well, you should take care of those. I was really even the nudists are like, you need to do something about that that you just come back to your little cabana and there's a like a pair of tweezers and scissors on your pillow. I was reading, Um, dude, Milwaukee used to have a nude beach. H Yeah, I was pretty surprised to hear that one. But it was called Paradise Beach and it was like a legit. I think it was clothing optional because it was county. Usually if it's a government beach, they can't legally exclude anybody, so it has to be clothing optional. Um, but I think it was clothing optionals Paradise Beach it but it was like family oriented nudist beach um. And it was Adjason or just down the beach from a beach called Bradford Beach, and that was a um you had to wear clothing beach. It's not nudist, but it was a party beach, and Bradford Beach, where you had to wear clothes, was a bigger party beach. Then um Paradise Beach, which was a clothing optional beach. And that's usually how it how it is, although eventually, and this is normally the case, sometime in the early nineties, some of the people from Bradford Beach started hanging out naked on Paradise Beach. Started like getting wasted and having sex, and it wasn't family friendly anymore, and there were complaints, and then the Paradise Beach is no longer. Yeah, that the whole sex thing is weird to me. It's not like a bathing suit is if that's the barrier that keeps you from just going hog wild sexually, it's not much of a barrier. No, it's true. I get the impression that this hall Over Park in Miami, it is known as the largest new beach in the United States and one of the most popular in the world. So it says our article, Um, I get the feeling it's it's way more of a party scene because have you ever been there? No, I was reading, Yeah, I read about it, and I looked up pictures and of course, you know, I'm sitting to my destiny looking at new people on the beach. It's just part of the job. But um, there's pictures of you know, it looks like a spring break with like forty people posing and they're all naked. And these were younger people too. This wasn't like the older set. I mean, it's all kind of people older and younger. But and again, just because I am who I am, I was like, oh, well, that's kind of completely normal actually, and the other part of you went, oh my god, what is going on there? I just don't know what to think. It's funny, it is funny and sad. But I mean the very fact that you are aware of it means that there's hope for addressing it, like once and for all. Yeah, I think the nudity problem. Yeah, you just go one way or the other. Either be like I'm totally fine with nudity. I'm going to make this my mission. Just be fine with nudity totally, or just go never nude. Just always worry like that pair of like daisy dukes under your clothes. No, but like you said, I am fine with it in my adult, rational, evolved brain. But that shame is so ingrained childhood. It's really hard to get you. It'll get you. All right, let's take another break out, how about that, and we'll come back and talk a little bit about Cape Cod and uh, some of the behaviors you should obviously avoid. That's why scame you should know. But Josh Clark define s all right, So I promised a little cape Cod talk. We mentioned hall Over Park. There's Blacks Beach in San Diego, very popular, long standing nude beach. Yeah, one of the first in the US, I think, yeah for sure. And that of course San Diego they I figured they would have one there. Yeah, dude, San Diego beaches in the seventies were like whatever you wanted to do. Yeah, it's like Three Company all day long. Yeah, but like the place, not just the innuendo, Like the stuff they were making innuendo about was actually going on. Right. Uh. I always think of um, whenever I think of like San Diego in the seventies and Three Company, I think of the what those bars called fern bars, Yeah, fern bars that we covered in the Bars episode. Yeah. The Regal Beagle was like literally a firm bar. I think they had ferns there. So anyway, Cape Cod and then I K seventies in Massachusetts had a bit of a fight going on their hands. Uh. The NPS National Park Service outlawed public nudity um and it was a big deal because there are guests in parts of Cape Cod. There were people that would go nude. UM. It ended up in lawsuits and the nude band was upheld. And they believe still are the only national park with a specific ban on nudity. Yeah, it's not I didn't know that. It's not a federally it's not a federal law in any federal park apparently except Cape Cod. Now, yep, it's the only one. So congratulations Cape Cod. You really showed your butt. Yeah, and I love it. Here it says now if there are conflicts, the park employees attempt to resolve it informally, right, Like I think everyone is just like, come on, you know, can we just work this out? Like why don't you go over here? You go over there and don't look at them, and can I go back, you know, to my office, which is which you need a lobster roll, rough hewn log cabin of my own making um, so yeah, you you. Cape cod is kind of an outlier. Usually there are like a nude beach getting legislated. It will go one of two ways, like they it'll start with a beach that people just say, this is our new nude beach. We're gonna start being nude here, taking my pants off. It's very remote. Normally it's hard to get to and a lot of nudists prefer it that way, like it's a little harder for them to get to it, but that also means it's a little harder for um perverts and um, you know, look you lose to get to well. Plus, remote beaches are the best kind of beaches, you know. They end up getting a score with like a very remote kind of tranquil scene. Uh. And then so you've got that, it will be an unofficial public beach, public nude beach. Uh. And then something will happen and the local government will either legislate that um officially it's clothing optional or else. No, it's not everybody needs to get dressed. Um, Normally it's every everybody needs to get dressed. Because usually it's the result of a complaint, like there's a there's some residents or an h O, a group or somebody nearby who considers that their beach and doesn't want a bunch of naked people frolicking around. And if the nudists are trying to make their case like no, we just want to be naked, we're not perverts or anything like that. If they're making their case, it's usually again underscored by people like getting wasted and having public sex on the nude beach um, which brings us chuck. I think to um where we should share some tips to people who are thinking of maybe going to a new beach. And the cardinal rule of a genuine nude beach is no sex. Don't have sex on the beach. No one wants to see that. Yeah, I think the first two cardinal rules of a nude beach, don't have sex and don't be a creep, are the same rules at a regular beach. Definitely, just don't you don't want to be a creep with your clothes on or yeah, this one says, you know, it goes to a lot of trouble to say, like don't take pictures of people. Don't take pictures they I mean they mentioned selfies, like if you're in the background. You may not realize someone's in the background, or god forbid, if there's a child in the background, family, Like, just put your camera away for a bit. Yeah, I mean, like, if you're taking pictures and there's a naked kid running around, do you are really putting your life in jeopardy depending on that kid's father and what his opinions are and creeps very true. So but again my point is is that applies to regular beaches too, fully clothed beaches. Don't take pictures of people at the beach. That's that's creepy and wrong. Agreed. What else, what's another two? Uh? This says and these were we should point out these were from the Hollover Beach website. Uh. And that's the party beach in Miami. Um. It says, don't just sit right down next to another person if there's like plenty of space on the beach. And again that's sort of like a regular beach. It's it would be a little weird on a variant. When I was just at Ala Palms, not many people there on a weekday this time of year, like hundreds of yards in between blankets and chairs. If someone would have sat down right next to me, I would have been like, uh, that's a little weird. Yeah, uh, why don't you go over there or over there or anywhere else? And especially truing a nude beach and then you turn and the person is actually made of stand and they blow away? What what is that? I just made it up? Okay, now everything's a reference alright, sort of weird fantasy film or something, maybe Dune. Uh. This thing says be sure to bring a towel. Yeah, this was good advice. Yeah, I mean that's pretty obvious. And they say that most people knew to bring two towels, one to sit on and put all your junk on that can get potentially gross, right, and then another one to actually dry your face with. Right. I would have brought a towel just to dry off with, but it wouldn't have occurred to me, like, no, you also need to bring a towel to sit on. Like, if you're gonna set a stool or chair or something, nobody wants your butt funk on their chair. That's groty, and you don't want somebody else's either, So let's think here. Yeah, I would say a beach chair rental company at a nude beach is probably not thriving, don't you think. Yeah, I mean that should be a tip as well, like maybe bring your own chair. Another tip that it said is if you get an erection, the there's ways of taking care of that. Get in the water, turn over onto your stomach. Think about no one's playing baseball. Uh, I mean if you're getting an direction on a on a nude beach, I don't know, that's I'm not sure what to say about that. Well, you could be like yeah, maybe yeah, I didn't really think about that. No, But I mean, but even if you're a dude and it's your first time or something gets you just right, Yeah, there's gotta gotta be some sort of etiquette for that. I think the point of this is is like, don't just walk around like, hey, everybody, it's happening, check it out, you know, like you want to just kind of keep that to yourself, is the point. Yeah? I would think that would be uh a big like stay away from me, signed to be other people, right, you know, you could take an eye out. O. Man, I really feel like we may have crossed the lines here there in this episode, and I'm not sure. Yeah do you think so? No? I just I'm surprised that I'm able to make it through this episode. To be honest, I'll bet there's a lot of people who are like, can't I can't listen to johsh and Chuck talking about this one. Bring sunscreen of course, um and that you know, kind of kidding around, but definitely not getting around because they make the very fine point if you're in your twenties or thirties or forties and it's your first time ever doing this, then by all accounts, it's probably the first time your body parts down there, your private parts, they have seen the sun. And that's a bad recipe. You know. Can you imagine I can't sunburn there? Could not imagine because this sunburn will ruin your vacation period. I can imagine sunburned penis would really put a dent in things. Yeah, this article suggests even bringing a hat to use, which I thought was smart, yet helmet that would definitely work. I got a couple more things. Um So. Back in the of the nineteenth century, the Victorians were pretty well known for being pretty prudish. Right, Um, on the surface, that is, yes, exactly on the surface, but at a public beach, all of that is out on display, so the surface is all that matters, right, So I ran across this invention that they came up with, at least in Australia, if not in the in England as well. But they, um, they had cabanas on the back of wagons that were pulled by horses and you would get into the cabana and the horse would draw the wagon with you in the cabana in it out to the ocean and then you would get out into the water so that nobody else would see you in any kind of remote state of undress. And we're still talking like wrists and ankle is covered. Um, that was too much. So they would get in these private cabanas and be drawn by horse out to the water. Yes, that's a that was crazy. And then fast forward to the nineteen fifties and there was a nudist trend that sparked all over Australia, and I think now Australia has something like, um, I think five designated nude beaches, which I was surprised it was that little, because in Britain there's eleven of them. Yeah, I was surprised by that too. And there's a great quote from this one counselor Brighton, who was, like, I guess, the local elected official from back in nine when Brighton became the first official nude beach, he said, I personally have got no objection to people showing their breasts and bosoms in general, genitalia to one another, jolly good luck to them, but for heaven's sake, they should go somewhere more private. And they had a great quote, Yeah maybe that's where I lie. Is it really so you have a problem with nude beaches. No, they're They're fine, just not for me. Gotcha? What about the private, private, private nude beach that I envisioned the island that you own, I would visit it without you there, and I would pull my shorts down for a minute, for sixty seconds, right, but not past the ankle. You just stand there with no no, no, I would still have my hands on them, I see, and I'd be like, jokes on you, whole islands under surveillance, jokes on you. It's a surprise party. Well that's new beaches, man, unless you got anything else. I got nothing else. Uh. If you want to know more about nude beaches and you made it this far through the episode, or what we could probably call a psycho drama between me and Chuck. You can type that word in the search bar at how Still Work dot com and we'll bring up this fine article. And since I said search bars, time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this. We helped a dude get into medical school and here goes Hey, guys, um. I started listening at the beginning of middle school, although the moment I was completely hooked was when I listened to the Delta Force episode. Since then, I don't think I missed an episode for nine year straight. Jumping back to present day, a few weeks ago, ahead of medical school interview, one of the interviewers asked me something to the effect of, how have you cultured a spirit of continuous learning in your life outside the classroom. One of the things I brought up was stuff you should know in The interviewer who asked the question was a fan. That shared connection at the beginning of the interview really helped to break the ice a bit, and the rest of the interview went really smoothly. Just her back that I have been accepted. I guess I can't say that our mutual love of S Y s K was the reason I got in, but I do think that having that connection helped me to relax and nail the interview from that point on. So thanks for helping break the US for me. H. Hearing back from you guys would make my week. Uh, well, do you want better? Isaac Lamb We read it on the air, good luck in med school. Uh, he lives in Indianapolis that he wants us to visit there for a tour, and I think we're gonna try and hit up Indianapolis at some point it's possible, and um, yeah, way to go, buddy. Yeah, congratulations on getting into mid school. Isaac. Great name too. By the way, I agreed. If you want to get in touch with us, like Isaac did, you can tweet to us.
