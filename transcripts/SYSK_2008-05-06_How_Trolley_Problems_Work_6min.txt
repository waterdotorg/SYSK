Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from how stuff Works dot Com? Hi, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, as staff writer here how stuff Works dot Com and with me as always is my trustee editor Chris Pallette and his fantastic goatee Chris. Today, I want to talk about how the trolley problem works. Very cool article that I wrote and you edited. So do you want to give some background on the trolley problem? What is it? Well, it's every San Franciscan's worst nightmare. Um. Imagine if you will, that there's an out of control trolley speeding down the tracks and if nothing stops it, then it's it's going to go out of control. It's gonna flip and kill the people on board. Five people, right, Well that's yeah, five or you know fifteen? Hey, you know it could be fully loaded? Who yes? Um? But the problem is these people are gonna die unless you do something to stop it. But you know it's speeding alley, what are you gonna do? Um? Until you notice that the track has a switch in it and that you could actually switch the the the track with this lever that you happen to be standing next to. Well, that's great, right, You're you're gonna switch it to another track. You're gonna save the lives of people in the trolley because it's going to give them a chance to slow down and stop. Except there's somebody on that other track, and if you pull that switch and save the lives of all the people on the trolley, then it will kill this other man. So it's an ethical dilemma. What do you do? It is an ethical dilemma. And there's the second part. What's the what's the second part? Well, the second part is this, there's no switch. There's just one track with an out of control trolley and several people on it who are going to die unless you do something. Um next to you stands a a person. Um you know, probably not a diminutive person. It would have to be somebody big enough to stop a trolley. But if you push them on top, on in front of the trolley onto the tracks, then you could stop the trolley and you know by slowing it down. But obviously you know the trolley would run over this person and kill them. That as a door nail, that is, so, what do you do? Do you sacrifice one life for many? That is a an excellent question and it's one that's been plaguing people since it was first produced in the sixties. UM. This this philosophical problem. It shows the distinction between allowing to die, which is, you know, pulling that lever and sending the man on the auxiliary track to his death, and actually actively killing somebody, which is pushing the less than diminutive man in front of the trolley. UM. What would you do, Chris? You personally, would you pull the lever? You know, it's one of those situations, UM, where you never know what you're really gonna do until you're actually thrust in that situation, and it's easy to say one way or the other, you know, based on I've got all the time in the world to make the decision. If I you know, sitting right here right now, I would say yes, I would I would uh sacrifice one person's life for the people on the trolley. UM. But you know, there's always the option of standing there horrified and watching it all happen and then realizing afterward that you know, would you late, would you push the man in front of the trolley. UM. That is much much tougher, UM, because then I would actively be killing somebody, uh to save the lives of someone else, you know. I I saw another article since this, uh this has been published that suggested, you know, there there are many ethical dilemmas like this. It's it's funny how the study of these kinds of questions has exploded in in UM colleges and universities. UM. And I saw this this additional one where what would happen if you had a trap door and you could drop the person to his death instead of you know, making pushing actually pushing him on the tracks. I don't know if I could actually kill somebody to save the lives of someone else if I were accent, you know, if it was an act of saving a group of people and it was a passive thing, you know, it would be much easier than if it was active. Your response is actually pretty much fall in step with the majority of people. Most people answer that they would pull the lever uh ergo. They are okay with dispatching someone to their death as long as they don't have to get their hands dirty. Most people draw the line at pushing the large man in front of the trolley. Um, and I can understand that. But what that talks about, What that that this closes is the our society's view of utilitarianism. Now, I mean, doesn't it make sense that under any circumstance you push one man to his death to save five or fifteen. You're you, you've saved four more than you've taken. It just makes sense. But we draw the line at that, And um, we've actually developed we've we've used that kind of philosophical view to develop rules in our society. Take, for example, transplants patients. Um, if you have somebody who likes to beat up kittens and they have a bunch of great organs, Uh, why don't we just kill those people, take their organs and deliver them to five people who don't beat up kittens. You know, it's these kind of dilemmas that that were faced with every day. And thank God for philosophy, is all I have to say.
