Josh: Hey, San Francisco, we're coming back to see you. Yes, our second year in a row. We're gonna be going to s F Sketch Fest. What I like to think, it's the premier comedy festival in the United States, probably well in the world, you think, so, yeah, what about Beijing? Nope, it's a it's a close second, but a second. Well, we love San Francisco, we love performing there. Everyone is always so kind to us. And by San Francisco we mean the entire Bay area of course. Yeah. So we will be there doing our thing for one time only show on Sunday, January at one pm. Yeah, it's the rare Sunday afternoon. We're like the NFL of podcasters. Yeah, exactly, That's that's what I've always thought. So all you have to do is go to the SF Sketch Fest site, look at the old calendar, and there are tons of great people performing. Oh yeah, So I suggest like just doubling down and getting tickets all kinds of good shows for sure, and hurry up and get tickets to ours because they've only been on sale for a week or so and they're already half sold out. That's right, So please hurry San Francisco. Please hurry. Welcome to Stuff You should know it's from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and it's just us chickens here in Studio one A. Yeah, the blockhead is gone. Yeah, Jerry the blackhead. I'm just kidding. She's not a blockhead. She's a meat hit. She is a meat head. This is fun. What else is she here? We can say whatever we want. She'll never hear this, that's true. Two things I've noticed today. We're both wearing blue hoodies. Oh yeah, yours is uh a recreation of the great sweater that Danny wore in The Shining Uh, which I think I've told you you love Lee Unk of Pixar owns that real sweat her. Oh yeah you did tell me that. Yeah, Like, if you're like, you know, you got the sweatshirt version. He owns the sweater. It's the real thing. But unless he's the same size as like a little four or five six year old boy, he put it on his own kid. Yeah, that's probably why he had a kids madness right well to model the sweater. Yeah, yeah, uh and I'm wearing my high school sweatshirt Dan Raiders. Yeah. Dan. The other thing I noticed is that got new glasses or a new prescription. My eyes were clearly getting worse, and you're fuzzy to me, but my papers are clear. Oh and I should have gotten the bifocals, Like he said, vocals, Gramps, I've been doing a lot of this definitely doesn't aid you at all, chuck his pull his glasses down his nose, and then looked over him. Well, when you're at home and let's say you got the TV on but you're working on your laptop, it's it's troublesome. Have you ever heard of that? Um? I can't remember what. It's called progressive lenses. No, it's like a type of basically training your eyes to get better by denying them corrective lenses. Well, I did that for forty three years and it didn't work. Well, I mean, or maybe it did work. Your eyes would have been way worse had you not done that. Here's what I know. I know that two weeks ago, like I never wore my previous glasses prescription because it didn't look like they were doing anything. Um, but things were getting harder to read. So I went back three years later and they were like, oh, yeah, things have changed. Um, but I was reading two weeks ago. I was just sort of holding it back a little more maybe. But now when I put these on, it's like someone turned on the lights. I was like, holy cow, that's so clear. But it's something changed in just the last few weeks. No, I think I would just I was just used to getting by on as clearly as I could, because once I put these on. I just couldn't believe the difference. It's good for you for doing something, Yeah, but now I gotta I gotta weird glasses all the time, or not all the time. But when I read, you remind me exactly of how I felt in fourth grade when I got glasses. They came in and they were like, okay, everybody's doing the eye test, and of course you just think it's cursory, like a lice check or something like that, right, and you went stood in the corner, and then the nurse or whoever it was just like, you need glasses. I was like, what, You're insane, woman, I think, is what I said. But it was a man, right, and so that's all they knew. I proved myself insane. Um yeah right, so uh, I ended up with glasses and I remember feeling like, oh man, I'm shackle for the rest of my life. Yeah, that's a tough age. I don't know if glasses still had the same stigma on young kids, but when we were kids, it was definitely like four eyes and all that. Yeah, there was a bit of it. So I showed them. I went out and got the most Elton Johnny glasses I could find. They were clear, with like a thin blue like wire running through the frames. They were pretty awesome. Yeah, alright, so human block Yeah, so, Chuck, have you ever seen the human blockhead trick? I should not call it a trick, just stunt. You're right, I have like in person. Yeah. Also, I went to a Gym Rose circus once and that they had a blockhead that when I went. I'm not sure if they still do. Was it Ryan Stock? I don't think so. This is a long time ago. Yeah, he seems a little young to have been in the original Gym Rose show. Yeah, I mean this was in like was it at Lallapalooza. Maybe because that was in the first the first part of the first Lallapaluza. They were part of that. Yea, how was that that show? There you go? Maybe that's where it was. Maybe so well, I've never seen a human blockhead, so I mean I was aware of it. I'm sure I'd seen like references to it in cartoons or whatever. But I went online because I noticed as I was researching this, I was like, wow, I feel like fainting for some reason. I was like, this really makes me fainty, and I went online and just exposed myself to it, and uh, it was Yeah, I didn't actually faint, but it's something. Well, we should go ahead and say, then, a human blockhead is a person, and we'll get into the history of it where that name came comes from. But it's a person, a performer who inserts a nail or a camping steak or a drill, paris scissors, what something sharp that would make your stomach turn if you saw it jammed in a person's nose all the way and they do just that. And the reason I corrected myself earlier I called it a trick. It's not a trick. The person who performs the human blockhead, or who is a human blockhead, um would correct me and say no, no, this is a stunt. A trick suggests that there's some sort of illusion, there's some sort of deception or stage magic going on. This is a stunt because it's exactly what you think it is. There's a nail going into the person's skull. Yeah. And if you don't know and you go to one of these, you probably think it's a trick. It's a fake nail. It's a collapsible or a telescoping nail or something. Um, maybe some sort of a slide of hand, like the old trick where you just turned to the side and act like you're pulling something out of your mouth, you know that old bit. Yeah, I finally figured that one out in my twenties. Uh, thanks to your glasses probably, um so to the uninitiated, it's uh. People probably leave these performances sometimes saying, well, you know, of course that wasn't real. There's no way, right, it's true, right, that's that's what you think. In the performers they play on that, right, it's part of the whole thing. But it's actually legitimately the nail is not fake, and it it actually is going into the person's head. But the further misconception is that, okay, if it is going in the person's head, that it's being driven into their skull, their bone um, either through a new hole that they're making because they're crazy, or an established hole that they have like um that they're they've used time and time again. Like uh, an ear piercing that it's healed over. Not the case. Yeah, I was about to say the body doesn't need any new holes, but I forgot about piercing. That you need piercing. But that's the only thing I can think of where you would want a new hole that's legitimate, right, Um, I don't know. Some doctors could want new holes for you, depending like if you got a colostomate or a tricky otomy. It didn't even think about that medical reasons. Or stellarc put an ear on his arm. I was thinking about him. I can't believe you remember that guy's name. Yeah he was if he didn't listen. Years ago we talked about him. He was a performance artist who put he molded in and grafted a ear look alike onto his arm, survived some terrible infections that was bluetooth compatible, so he could literally hear through it. Right, I mean you know what I mean. He yeah, he's probably not literally hear through it, but it had like a bluetooth mic in the ear, and then he had like a head phone in his own ear, So yeah, he could hear what was going in there. With assistance of technology, he should hear through it. Well, he's a performance arts what do you expect? But that technically wasn't a hole though. No, it was just a fake ear on his arm. No, it was a real ear. Was it? A really? Whose was it? It was like a cloned ear grafted onto his arm. It was basically the cutting edge of performance art at the time. Yeah, I wonder what he's doing now. I gotta look that cat up. He's sitting around on people's couch, is going like, hey, remember that time I grafted in here on my arm? That was pretty great? Huh? And he says, hey talked to the forearm and they say still ark. We never get tired of that, Joe. Um So should we talk about the history first or the mechanism? Let's do history. I love this guy. Well, by guy I know you're talking about because there can be only one Mr Melvin Burkhardt, who passed away fifteen years ago in two thousand one, at the age of ninety four years old. He's born in Atlanta uh in seven, grew up in New Orleans mainly, and quit school at an early age and became a well we worked a couple of odd jobs, worked for Western Union, but then found his calling as a sideshow performer, which we've covered on the show. Yeah, along with other circus arts. Yeah, you you've got it for circus arts. I think just about every circus art one we've ever done is your pick? Was it? But man, we have an extensive library of circus arts. Yes, swort, swallowing, lion taming, lion taming, fire eating, fire eating. Do we have firewalking? No? I don't think so. All right, look for that one soon. Yeah, for real or tight rope backs. We had a circus families we did. He's exhausted this, I don't know, man, firewalking? We should do the the wheel. We talked about it, the wheel with the motorcycles in it. What's it called? The something of death? Wheel of death? No globe of death. Maybe maybe he's a globe of death. Clunky clunky ride right? Um? All right? So back to Mr Brookhart. He started performing inside. He did so he was. He kind of fell into performing. He used to go to the theater a lot. And one day when he was I think fourteen or fifteen or something, Uh, he jumped to his feet when the people on stage ask for volunteers to come on stage, and I guess he tripped or fell. I don't, I didn't know if it was purposeful or not, and drove a nail through his for her right, and everyone's just laughed and laughed. Um, he did get some last not for the nail yet, that came later, but um, he was invited back for the next show, and within a day or two he found himself with a contract to do an amateur performance. So he started um performing at a very early age. And and um, his his thing initially was and I think throughout his career he was what was called a talker, a master of ceremonies at a side show. Yeah, uh, you might call him a barker or something like that. But um, they were the ones who kept the show going. They introduced the new side show performers as they came on and went off, And he did his own act in between the other acts, and part of his act ended up being the uh the nail, the human blockhead trick, among a bunch of other stuff. Yeah. So one of these quotes that I got his New York Times obituary and um, which are always great, but one of the quotes from one of his counterparts, and Coney Allen was so funny. He said, this was from Dick Zigon. Uh, he's a side show guy, and he said, anybody can insert objects in their nasal passage, their nasal passage, but Melvin's patter and comedy made it an act. And then the other guy. It's two great quotes. Todd Robbins, as a magician, uh, who was also a blockhead at times, says, anyone who has ever hammered a nail into his nose it was a large debt to Melvin Burkhart. Yeah, there's a little bit of tongue in cheek in that oh bit that I'm sure Burkhart would have appreciated. Um. That Todd Robbins guy actually has traced it back um to the Joddu Wallas, basically the Indian the Hindu performers, street performers, UM. And they apparently did a human blockhead trick long ago. And I don't know if it was just totally coincidental that Melvin Burkhardt stumbled upon it himself, or if he had heard about it or seen it himself. But at any rate, as far as it goes in the West and the modern conception of the human blockhead, Melvin Burkhart was the guy who invented it. Yeah, I'm sure they're probably people in India scoffing at that notion. But he was soon discovered by none other than um Mr Ripley himself, and he took him on to his auditorium in Manhattan, had him performing, and supposedly is the one who came up with the name human blockhead for this act. Man that Robert Ripley, he coined a lot of stuff. I don't get it, though, I still don't get why blockhead this is. It's a dumb name. I would have called it, like, I don't know what I would have called it. Give me ten minutes, though, and I'll think of about Okay, shout it out when you got it all right? Well, I mean, like you can hammer nails into a block of wood. I guess so is that what? It's a stupid name, But without it we wouldn't have the Lucy from peanuts favorite Um put down. Remember she called everybody a blockhead? Oh yeah, what about the human pincushion. That's not quite right, though it's okay. It's actually a lot more accurate. But at think there are other human pin cushions, aren't there people who do? That would be very confusing. I'm the pin cushion. No, I'm the pin cushion. You're a blockhead? Um? So he uh, he actually ended up And this is where this story ties into Flee circuses. Actually, uh at Hubert's Museum on Fort Street, which I believe is where the Hecklers had their Um Flee circus for decades and where the where it appeared in Easy Rider. That's right, Yeah, that's right. Uh. Boy's all coming together, isn't it really? Uh? And he was what was known as um like some people are. You know, when we did our side show podcasts, a lot of people were born with physical deformities. If they would um, some people say we're exploited. Other people say championed. But he was not that. He was what was known as a working act. So he just had some talent and fortitude to do some of these things. He wasn't necessarily born with any strange nasal passage, although he does say he was a boxer and broke his nose such that they removed nasal bones that he thinks created this passage to um inserting a nail into your sinus cavity. Um, But it is, it exists in everyone, Okay, So that to me is a great place to put a break. All right, you're ready, Yes, here we go. All right, Chuck, you may mention that, um, Melvin Burkhard was a boxer, right, So apparently during his boxing career, he was getting some bone that had been shattered in his face removed around his nose, around his nasal cavity, and the story goes that he noticed that the doctors were having a really easy time sticking like a scalpel or pincers or all sorts of little medical instruments in his nose. Rubber Chicken. Henny Youngman was his doctor. Just look him up, everybody, uh. And he was like, well, jeez, if these guys can put the stuff in my nose, I'll bet I could too, And if I combine it with my pattern comedy, I could really make a good show of this. And apparently that's where he was inspired to do the human blockhead trick. I can make fifty a week. So he had something like a dozen pieces of bone removed from his nasal cavity area from his skull for medical reasons right speak from his boxing career. Um, so he apparently had a larger than normal nasal cavity as a result. Well that makes sense. But it's like what you said. Everybody has a hole in their face and it can be exploited to do the human blockhead trick. We have a lot of holes in our face. So let's talk about the holes in our face. Right, Chuck, just put his glasses on. I'm tired of looking over you and feeling like I'm seventies? So how do I look without? Like? I gotta get a picture of this? How do you look when I'm looking at you through the glasses. Without the glasses? You look great? How do I look with the glasses on? Not so great? Larger and fuzzy. So look at me over the clare you go wow. Alright, we'll put that up on Instagram. Alright, the holes in our face? Um, let's talk about the skull. The skull while it appears as if it's just one big solid bowling ball with a face on the front of it. Right, Um, it is not. It is twenty two bones and all. And if you look, if you've ever seen a human skull, you can see this because they have sutures where it's joined together. It's a big patchwork of of goodness, protective goodness. And for the most part, when you look at someone's face and you say, hey, high cheekbones, prominent chin, um, look at the size of those teeth and how pointy they are, that's crazy. These are these are actually like features of either the bone themselves, are the bone underneath the skin. That's your facial features. Right. But there's one very prominent exception to this rule, um, and that's your nose. Your nose is not the result of uh protrusion of bone with skin stretched over it. Most of your nose is made of cartilage, right, So there's actually very little bone involved in your skin. Just on the bridge or with your nose. Just on the bridge of the nose, that's right, Okay, So beneath the bridge of the nose, everybody, I want you to to take your anger, put it between your eyes and then just pressed down. That's the bridge of your nose, not too hard, Not that hard, okay, and then just go slides, start to slide a little further down. That is not bone any longer, that's cartilage. And behind that cartilage, friends, there's a big old hole in the center of your face. Have you ever had your nose broken? Let me just knock on with like fifty times. No. Have you ever been punched in the nose? Yes, but didn't break it? No, Okay, I've never had my nose broken. I've never been punched. Knock on wood at all. Yeah, uh no, never been in a fight. That's great, it is, but I kind of feel like I should get in a fist fight. That There's this thing called bars, and if you go out at certain times, you can get into a fight pretty easy. I was always the guy that was breaking up like like, oh, guys, like it would be much more fun if we all just kept drinking and not get in a fight like that. That there's nothing that will ruin a night more than a bar fight. It's all over bar fight suck. Yeah, across the board. Plus, I never always had a very strong inclination to not get punched in the face. I think that's a sensible inclining. So I was, well, not really. You know, you see how some people act and some people some dudes love to fight, some ladies love to fight. You know. Yeah, I could go out looking for it. Sure, I don't know that that's to be admired or celebrated in anything anyway. It's the worst those people like. And when I lived in Arizona that short year, I picked up just you know, friends at my restaurant, and one of the friends of the dude that worked there was one of the most uncomfortable people to hang out with have ever experienced. He was always looking to get in a fight every where we went, and it just I was so fraught with anxiety, you know, tons of anger inside. And is it just don't you wonder stuff like that is hormonal, Like that guy's hormones are tuned a little out of I bet you there's a lot of factors hormones upbringing anger from childhood. But all I know is is that I was like, I felt like I was gonna have a heart attack every time I was near this dude. So I was just waiting for the inevitable fits fight. Wouldn't it be need If that guy listens listening right now, knows who you're talking about. And it's just started sobbing uncontrollably, like he's just had a breakthrough. Would be great because you mentioned his childhood. He's not listening. I'm can guarantee you that. So um oh yeah the nose, yeah yeah, so cartilage, the nose is easy to break, is kind of where I was getting. But technically you're not really breaking yet really because it's cartilage. I guess you can break cartilage. Don't listen to me. So. Um. What you've also got in that in your face up front of that skull is um, all kinds of spaces. Uh. There are these little hollow places called sinuses. You got your eye sockets of course. Uh. And then you're the old reliable foreman magnum, which is where the brain stem exits the skull. That really has nothing to do with this episode, It doesn't. This is just sort of a breakdown of what's going on in your face, Tracy. By the way, this is a Tracy Wilson joint. Sure, um, And she's just trying to prove her point that there's lots of holes in the skull. That's right. The only holes that matter for a blockhead are the nostrils, and I would say the nasal cavity, right, And the nasal cavity is that whole in your skull, in the front of your skull where your nose goes, and um, that leads all the way back to your throat actually, yeah, which is very important actually for other acts that we'll talk about. Yeah, So the the area where it terminates at the throat is called the naso farynx. And all of this is just wide open. You can stick whatever you want in there, um, please don't, and you can do it without nailing, without hammering, without anything like that. You can just slide it in. Right. Physically speaking, we'll get into how all the reasons why that's very difficult, but just physiologically speaking, there's a big old hole in the front of your face. There's a lot of empty space behind it, going all the way back to your throat, and so the human blockhead takes advantage of this this um uh, these holes. Right. But it wouldn't be so great if you could just look at somebody and say, hey, that's well, it's great. You're just sliding a nail into a hole in an open passage. That doesn't do anything. The trick. The illusion is based on the natural formation of our nose and our nostrils, which appear to go upward, which is not the case. Actually, if you pull your nose back and look into a mirror, you see that the hole is behind him, not above them, right, And that's the whole illusion. Yeah, Like you feel like when you blow your nose, that snot is coming down from like the top of your head, and that's not the case. Now, it's coming from the back, that's right. It's the ceiling is just about even with the top of the nose right below your eyes, the ceiling of the nasal cavity, right, yeah, not the ceiling of your your bedroom. Uh. In the floor of the nasal cavity is about level with what's known as the L R cartilage a L A R, which is where the nostrils are, right, that's the bottom of your your nostrils. Yeah. So when you see it, like you said, when you see the trick, the fact that it's not going up and it's just going straight in, it makes people go, oh my god, what is going on. He's driven his nail right into the bone of his skull. That's what it looks like. That's right. And by the way, if you want a good a good view of all this looks like I stumbled upon a horrific photo of somebody who's nostrils. I guess there this the cartilage that separates their nostrils into two. Yeah, there's got to be a name for that. Right, it's gone, and the whole nose is the skin of the nose is being pulled back so you can see the skull behind it. So if you wanted to just type in all our cartilage and Google search image searching, you will. You'll be as unhappy as I am for having seen it's gonna go, rather than do you want to see it? Nah, it's pretty crazy now, that's all right, Okay, I'll look at it later because I know i'll I want to. I'll be lying in bed tonight thinking of it. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not doing it. H So to finish up, though, in the cavity it is not just a smooth straight thing either. They have um. They're these grooves called conka c U N c h A E I'm gonna say um on the walls and they hold onto the moisture when you exhale and that's gonna keep everything nice and lubricated, which is what you want in there, thanks to the mucus membrane that lines all these surfaces and keeps everything nice. And I'm not gonna say the M word, but nice and moist. Yeah, everybody hates that word, huh and not everyone, but there's science behind it. Okay there. I can't remember a post an article for mental phlaws. Apparently there's some science behind White people don't like that word nice. So when you're doing the human blockhead trick, I should change that when you're when you're seeing a professional do the human blockhead trick. Um, what they're doing is they're they're sliding the nail. Let's just stick with the nail. The nail into their nasal cavity. They want to usually hug the alar cartilage the floor of their nasal cavity, try to avoid the concat. Isn't that way you decided? That's pronounced? And then they're pushing it all the way back into their naso pharynx. Right, You've got about six eight inches of space to deal with from that much from your nostril back to the naso pharynx. Yeah, um, and Uh, they the human blockhead to make it so it's not just sliding a nail into your nose, which is gross, but that's pretty playground. Ee. They will take a hammer and they will hold onto the nail very tightly, and they will make it look like they're hammering the nail into their skull. Right, and there's the sound of the hammer against the nail and it sounds really painful. Where really you can just take the thing and slide it in, easy peasy. Yeah, that's called stagecraft. Right. So all of this sounds extremely easy, and in a sense it is. But there are a lot of obstacles to performing this trick successfully, and we'll talk about those right after this. So I don't think we should go any further without a serious c o A message. It seems obvious, but do not try to stick a nail in your nose because Josh and Chuck said it was possible. Yeah, that's really good. Um, the human anatomy, the anatomy of a of a face and a skull, makes it possible. We advise no one to ever try this unless you want to get into the circus arts legitimately and want to take the steps to like really learn how to do this right. I actually ran across this um theory eleven dot com forum. The novice was asking how to do this, and this guy named William Draven replied, and I thought he had a pretty good c o a himself. He said, like, UM, if you do want to do this, in no way advocate um learning from reading text on the internet or even watching videos. Go find somebody who is who has successfully performed this trick numerous times and then learned from them directly. Don't learn from guys like us. Don't learn from reading William Draven's comments on the internet. Don't don't read it from anybody. Go find somebody who knows this trick and and learn it from them. And where do you find that person? There? The guy in the corner of the bar with the nail in there? Now, it's pretty easy, right, or they live in a town called Winter or something in Florida. Um And I did, look, we keep saying, dudes. I did try and find to see if there are any women out there who did this. I didn't find any, but I'm sure they're sure they're They're supposedly more than a hundred human blockheads around the world. Go find one of them. I'm sure some women do this. I'm sure it's just not a prominent Google search to type in, you know, woman blockhead. I'm sure they also. I think every single time I've ever said guys, I've I've meant it as a gender neutral Yeah. Yeah, so. Um. One thing Tracy points out is that all noses are different. Uh, and sometimes to reach your nasal cavity, you might the lower edge of your nostril might be in the way. So you know, sometimes it might just glide right in and you look the same. But sometimes it will, like if you do it right, you know, your nose will stick up like, you know, like your snout will stick out like a pig because the nails holding it up. Other noses, it might just look normal except for the fact that there's a nail through it. Um. A lot of people who do this, most people, I should say, who do it practice initially with Q tip. That's probably smart, right yeah, um, yeah, you want to practice with a que tip. And one reason why you want to practice with a Q tip is number one. It's I would guess it'd be harder to injure yourself with a Q tip. I'm sure, although I'm sure it's still be quite easy, sure, um. And then that Q tips are kind of fuzzy. Yeah. And so one of the hardest things to overcome doing the human blockhead trick their stunt is overcoming the sneezing reflex. That's the biggest one. I mean, there's all sorts of other problems, like if you use something that's not clean, um, you set yourself up for sinus infection because you're sticking foreign objects back there around your scinus is. Um, you can damage the very soft mucous memories and tissue that are around that line your nose and nasal cavity and your scinuses and your nasal farynx. But one of the one of the biggest challenges is overcoming the sneezing reflects, which can combine all this stuff, all these dangers and then increase some tenfold. Yeah. If you're trying to stick a nail in your head in the early stages and you sneeze that, you know sneezing can be a very violent reaction. So let's talk about sneezing real quick, all right, All right, So Tracy went to the trouble of outlining how a sneeze works right, it's pretty neat. So you've got a sneez has a reef. What's called a reflex arc. Any kind of reflex, as far as the human body is concerned, consists of a reflex arc, and it's made up of a receptor. In this case, Um, we've got nerve endings in our noses. Those are the receptors, and they're the things that say, you know, I just snorted pepper up my nose yea, or this house is dusty or whatever might cause you uh you know, animal dand or whatever. Hops in beer for me. Oh yeah. So like if you literally smell like an I p A. I don't even have to smell it. I can just just drinking it, just like one good sneeze and then you're fine. Yeah wow, hops gets me Hops and peppermint huh yeah. Um, So you've got you've got the stimulus against the receptor. The receptors got the the sensory nerve leading up to the integration center of your brain that the whatever center integrates all of this information for that particular reflex. Uh, your motor nerve which says, hey, go do this, and then it's called an effector in the case of sneezing and effector is the process the physical process of sneezing? Right? Yeah, which you know everyone everyone sneezes. Let's get real. You know what was interesting to me, Chuck, is you know when you're researching yawning, you yawn when you research itching, did you sneeze? You scratch, didn't sneeze? I thought the same thing. Really, I wonder if I'm gonna start sneezing, and I did not. It's not suggestible, totally reactive thing. So when you sneeze, you know your you might start off with your eyes watering. Uh, and you're gonna secrete some fluid from your nasal passage. And then there's an abrupt like pre sneeze breath that you draw in from your diaphragm. Um, I don't think that has a name. Let's just call it the pre SNEeSe breath breath. I think we just coined it. Uh. And then and then you're I fram in muscles in your chest contract really quickly, and the air leaves that nose and mouth really quickly. Um. Do you have a sneeze pattern or is it random? Um? No, I'm sure I follow a pattern almost always sneezing. Threes is your three, yes, but I mean it depends, like I seriously will sneeze eight or nine times if you're drinking a poppy beer. Um, yeah, I'm almost always three. And when it's not, it's it stands out to me as being unique or incomplete. So yeah, sometimes or sometimes I'll sneeze later and think like, oh, yeah, there's the third, which is silly. It's like celebrity deaths. I wonder about. I meant to look that up though, wonder if there's any science to that sneezing patterns. There's just science to everything, science and magic. Um. So you can put off a sneeze. You've probably done that before. That tickling sensation just goes away. Those are to me the incomplete things because you felt like or I feel like, you know, so close and I clearly needed to sneeze, but you didn't. If your body doesn't sneeze and it it warded itself off. Yeah. And so the point of all the sneezing talk is that part of mastering the human blockhead stunt is reducing your sneeze reflex and apparently it can be done just by exposing yourself to a sneeze reflex, over and over and over again. So you just stick that que tip in there. You sneeze, You do it again, you sneeze, You do it again, you sneeze. You go eat a TV dinner and take a little break because it's tough and you're mad. You're really mad, get really fixed off, and then you come back, and then you do it again, and then eventually a few days later, a few weeks later, you've lost all your friends, but you don't sneeze when you stick something up your nose. Victory. Yeah. I also saw that if you, uh, if you are a human blockhead, you want to basically scrub down any new stunt nail that you've got with this with steel wool and then soaking in rubbing alcohol for a while to prevent sinus infections. I'm picturing like a Carnie thriller where someone creeps in and like switches out the nail some pathogen. No I'm dead. Uh So, Like I said, there are over a hundred people doing this around the world. Supposedly. Um Ryan Stock, who you mentioned earlier, has become pretty famous because he's been on I think he had a TV show of his own He was definitely an America's got talent. Yeah, and he does all sorts of things. He and his wife, Oh she in on the act. Oh yeah, she's definitely part of an Amberlin So, like I said, he does all kinds of things. But um, one of his most notable tricks is a spin on this called the human meat head where just look it up Ryan Stock. He puts a meat hook. Remember how he set it was connected to the throw. He will go all the way through his nose, out of his mouth with the end of the hook, and then he'll pull stuff around. He actually pulled the almost the pound car. He hels the world's record as being the only person that ever doing You gotta hear this the title of this world record. He has a world record for the heaviest vehicle pulled using a hook through the nasal cavity and out of the mouth point three five pound car. No idea, how much that isn't killograms? Uh? I remember my brother he ate something when he was the first time I realized that was all connected. He laughed a lot when eating hamburger and coughed hamburger through his nose or milk through the nose. When you made your friend laugh. That was always That's a classic, man. You just were triumphant the rest of the day. I actually have found if I'm jogging, like I always chew gum and I like break the gum slowly into small pieces and I eventually like eat it or whatever. But if there's like a few moments where like there there's a small piece of gum separated from the rest of the gum, and I've noticed every once in a while, I don't know what sets it off, but I'll just snot it out, like it'll shoot up my throat and then on my nose. And this sapped more than what I don't you're either not jogging, right, you're not chewing gum, right, there's something there's a breakdown here. I don't think you're supposed to do that. It's true, weird. Does it hurt? No, it's just surprising, Like, sure, it's the gum. What do you mean it's like pieces of brain. Did you ever hear about the woman who had like a running nose for twenty years and she finally went to the doctor and they're like, that's cerebro spinal fluid. Your brain is leaking out of your nose. Was she okay? I guess, I mean she lived with it for decades. That's crazy. Um. And there's this other guy that I want to mention too, the faith healer. Oh yeah, John of God. And this made me want to do I'd love to do a show on faith healing period and a show on psychic surgery like those are definitely on the list now. Um. But he is a famous Brazilian faith healer who um, I mean he's he's big, like if he's he's way more famous than I thought he was because I hadn't heard of him. But he's a big time and um, he does these. He has a couple of kind of operations, uh, one visible and one invisible. And one of the visible ones is he sticks forceps up the nose of people and to supposedly heal them of certain things. And apparently he was exposed by the great James Randy, Um, the amazing Randy who we talked about, the great legendary skeptic old sour Puss what's that his name? Did ever see the documentary? No? I haven't yet. It's really good. There's a great documentary called um an Honest Liar about the amazing Randy. He's just so interesting. But he he I think ABC or CBS or someone got him involved. Yeah, ABC TV to expose uh John of God. And he said, well, for sure one of the things. I mean, he's exposed psychic surgeons before, but he said, this force ups up the nose thing. There's nothing more than the blockhead trick, and that's all he's doing. Fraud. We'll do a human or no, a psychic surgery one. For sure. That sounds pretty interesting. I remember seeing that when I was a kid. I thought it was like the real deal. That apparently Andy Kaufman like went to psychic surgeon and then figured out the scam. So sad, so says Milosh Foreman. At least yeah, he's like chickens in the hand. I see it. Uh, you got anything else? I do not. If you want to know more about human blockheads, you can type those in the search part how stuff works dot com. You can search human blockhead online. There's at least one good Melvin Burkhart performance on YouTube. Don't forget to look up all our cartilage, um Ryan Stock and also shout out to um Zen Arts l A for their article on blockheads that was helpful. As well. Since I said all that, it's time friends for listener mail. So Chuck, I guess this is the last one of the year. Yeah, yeah, we should say before we do mail. Um, Happy New Year, everybody. Yeah, be safe. We want to see everyone in and um we kind of said it in the Christmas episode. But thanks for everything over the years. Yeah for real, it means a lot to us. And uh we we just can't wait to get things going again. And by your calendar, just a couple of days by your Earth calendar. And also on a personal note, happy birthday too, my darling wife. You me, Happy birthday? You me? Okay, Well it's time for listening mail. Huh. I'm gonna call this uh banning advertising the kids. We heard from a lot of people on this. It's a hot topic. Hey guys live in Northern Virginia. Just listen to your show on advertising for children. I want to relate an relay and experience we had with our eighteen then eighteen month old daughter. We're on vacation with her in Florida. Had a day with nothing on our to do list, so we decided to take a drive to Walt Disney World. We also found a bag full of cash in our club compartment. My husband was was hesitant about going because of her young age and the fact that she had zero exposure to Disney at this point. I persuaded him by saying she would enjoy the parades and the characters, even if she didn't know who they were. Literally, only television she had ever seen at that point was educational programming on PBS Kids, and that was even minimal. So as we turned onto the road trying to make our way to the Magic Kingdom, there was a water tower in the distance decorated like Mickey Mouse, ears and all, and my daughter immediately shouted, look, it's Mickey Mouse. But they were like, yeah, how do you know that? Uh. My husband and I were both completely surprised. We could not believe that our daughter had been indoctrinated into recognizing that brand at only eighteen months, especially since we hadn't taught her that. Most likely she was shown a toy or a book at daycare. Uh. It is not that we were against that Disney or anything, obviously, because we were taking her there. It's just very shocking to see your young child parrot that information. This could also be evidence of reincarnation well, at least what if it was like a billboard and she's like, look, it's a new Gangrich that would be cause for alarm. I know this advertising is everywhere and it's nearly impossible to avoid, and just hope we can eventually teach her to not be fooled and use critical thinking to make decisions rather than her emotions. Thanks for all you do to make my long commute so much more enjoyable. That is from Stacy, And she says, my daughter now is nearly five and gets annoyed by commercials, so she pauses television until she can fast forward through them all one point for technology. Nice. Well, thanks a lot, Stacy. We appreciate that. It's a cool story. I hope you guys had a good time at Disney World. Um, and uh, that's it right.
