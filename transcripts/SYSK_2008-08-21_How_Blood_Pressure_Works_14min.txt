Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from How Stuff Works dot Com? Stuff you should know is brought to you by Visa. We all have things we like to think about online fraud. Shouldn't do one of them, because with every purchase, Visa prevents, detects, and resolves online fraud safe Secure Visa. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark Stafford or here at How Stuff Works dot Com with me, as always is Charles W. Bryant. Chuck. What's going on? It's good to be here, Josh as always. Yeah, Yeah, I'm feeling the same way, Chuck. I'm feeling that pretty good. So you guys might not know this, but Chuck always kind of keeps me abreast of current events, situations going on in the world. Would you have for me today, Chuck? Today, Josh, I have the cause of death results for legendary soulsinger Isaac Hayes. Yes, the man who scored Shaft died recently. I'm Jim. Yes he did. He died apparently while jogging on his treadmill, which is um very sad. Yes, and it looks like the cause of death is uh stroke because of high blood pressure. You know, that's funny that you bring that up, because I've been wanting to talk about high blood pressure also known as hypertension for a while. Lately. I'm feeling like this's a good opportunity to do it. Right, Yeah, let's do it. You know how stuff works. Stuff You should know. It's not always just fun and games. Sometimes we want to help people out with a little health advice. Agreed, So so let's do that, right, let's do it. Well, Chuck, this doesn't in any way, shape or form qualify me as any kind of medical professional. But I spent a trimester in E m T School. Do you know that about it? Yeah? Yeah, seriously, I had no idea I did, uh, and I was terrible at it um. For the final exam for the trimester, uh, the instructor brought in some of his former students who are now E m T s and they acted like they were suffering from some sort of uh terrible medical condition and we had to figure it out based on the symptoms. Right. Well, I am a terrible diagnostician. Um, I I landed a victim. I just made air quotes who was choking? And I treated her like a burn victim, um, and laid her down, and I think I started doing CPR or something on her. And I knew that I had completely missed the mark when she looked over at the instructor with this what the heck should I do now? Expression? And He's just like, keep going, keep going. She grabbed her throat and you thought that she had burned her neck pretty pretty much. Yeah, yeah, I failed miserably. Um, But there were a couple of things I learned. One of them was how important it is to take care of the old ticker. I mean, we're we're getting to be about that age, chuck. I hate to break it to you. I just reached thirty two. I'm very depressed about that. But five onto that, my friend. Yeah, so you're pushing forty now pushing, Yeah, and and neither one of us are in prime physical condition, right, I think that's a fair assessment. Yeah. Yeah, So I'm no triathlete, no, And I love bacon. I love it. I love it so much I can't even begin to tell you. But one of the problems with bacon is that fat that we eat and digest gets carried through the blood stream, and uh, it doesn't always break down like it should know. It starts to form plaque within blood vessels, which actually can lead to hypertension. And you want to know how well, first of all, I think we should just tell people what blood pressure is, period because people hear the blood pressure and they don't understand what it is. It's really simple. Blood pressure actually is all it is is the measurement of the force of the blood going through your arteries against the artery walls. Yeah, your your heart actually UM creates it generates an electrical impulse. The the electrical impulse travels across the heart and it's picked up by the atria, which is which contracts. Right, the blood is forced out of the heart and into the blood vessels. So there you've got. You've got your systolic pressure, which is the first number on a blood pressure reading, right, it's something over something and that's that's the first one, the one on top. And the optimal for systolic pressure I think is like one twenty for the average healthy adults once twenty year or under is what you're looking for right now. UM to measure this kind of thing, it's it's luckily right. We don't need trepid nation or any kind of rectal exam. You can just slap a blood pressure cuff on your arm, and thanks to our good friend Mercury, we can measure the pressure exerted on any given blood vessel. Is the blood car pumps through it? Right? And I I personally love those things when you get your blood pressure checked. Ever since I was a kid, I just thought when the when it constricts around your arm and tightens up and you can feel your heart beating in your arm, I just thought it was really neat. And chances are if you go to a grocery store a drug store, you might find me sitting at one of their little machines. It's a it's a great thing. It's a great way to pass the time. Yeah, but it's not. Actually, I did some research. It's not always the most accurate read. So people need to know this when they get their blood pressure checked by machine at your local Kroger. Uh. It may have been accurate when they first installed it, but it needs to be maintained and recalibrated over the years, so if it's not, it may be off you. You might can get a good idea that you should look into it further, but you shouldn't, you know, make any medical decisions based on what you uh, what you get when you're picking out your hot dog buttons and you're we we hear how stuff works. Strongly advise you to console the physician for just about anything, including blood pressure readings. But yeah, at the very least, it's it's kind of a joy to have your arms squeezed by a robot. You never know if if the thing's gonna go berserk and just snap your arm right off. I think, yeah, that's part of the fear, is that it will take on a mind of its own and sever my arm off. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's everybody's fear. So what about diastolic? That's the bottom number, right uh, And I think for a healthy adult eighties a good reading. Um so, the the the good blood pressure reading, a very healthy blood pressure reading is one eight. That bottom number represents what the normal relaxing or relaxed pressure on a vessel, uh is when the heart is at rest, when when the blood's not being four wors through. It's just you know, the hearts at rest blood vessels just sitting there like oh, I'm waiting for the next pump, you know. Uh, so eighties good? Um. And the thing is is those numbers can change just a little bit and make some really you know that it can be it can be really bad with just a couple of numbers being off. Right. Well, tell me more, Well, I will tell you more, Chuck. Let me tell you about the third kind of pressure reading. It's called pulse pressure. Uh. It's not uh necessarily widely accepted yet, although it's really gaining traction. So pulse pressure is just the difference between the systolic and diastolic pre pressure readings. Right, So if one twenty over eighty is optimal health for blood pressure reading, then forty would be the optimal pulse pressure. It's the difference when eighty got you. If it's uh, if it's a high, or if the difference is high, uh, you've got problems. It can mean that your your blood vessels are hardened, that they have lost elasticity. There's there's all sorts of problems with it. It can also mean that your heart is getting a little too buff. Hypertrophy, all right, buff in this case is not good. No, it's good for the bicep not good for the heart because an overly buff heart can can fail a lot more easily. Yeah, so we've got the pulse pressure difference, and and I read that every ten um millibars of mercury, which is the pressure reading difference, actually increases your chance of stroke by like eleven percent. So so it's important to keep an eye on your blood pressure and and to keep an eye on whether or not you're you're hypertensive or pre hypertensive. Um. And Uh, again, the best way to find that out is to just go visit your doctor regularly and get some blood pressure reading, right, because hypertension a k A. High blood pressure. There's pre high pertension, which you mentioned, which is before it's a real problem, but it's when you can really correct it with your diet and things like that. And then um, secondary hypertension and hypertension or when things get out of hand, when you're in danger of maybe a cardiac arrest or stroke. Uh. And then the other thing I want to talk about, which I thought was kind of interesting, was white coat hypertension. Give it to me, this sounds interesting. Yeah, this is when, uh, your your blood pressure actually elevates when you go to the doctor. Oh, from from being nervous. I'm not sure if it's from being nervous or not, but it's you have a different blood pressure. White coat obviously it's what the doctor wears and the doctor's office and you at home. And I guess you know, my easy answer would be don't come into doctor and you won't get high blood pressure. But that's that's no good advice. And you should also be wary of any doctor that doesn't wear a white coat, right, Yeah, yeah, that's that's good advice too. That is interesting. They've also found that um pregnant women can often demonstrate higher blood pressure just because of their pregnancy as well. It can be normal before the pregnancy, it can be high during the pregnancy, and then go back to normal afterwards. To the impression I got was that we didn't have a really good read on exactly why that happens. We just know it does happen, much like the white coat blood pressure exactly. And uh, I've got some other stats for you if you just want me to do. You know how I feel about stats, Chuck, don't tease me, give me to me. Well, uh, they did some studies on percentage of adults twenty years over that have high pertension or that are taking medication for hypertension. And overall thirty percent of men and women are following into that category, which really, yeah, which is more than I thought. Over twenty I would think that the maybe a stat over forty or fifth women come in and right at the thirty percent mark. Men a little bit less believed or not at pent and uh, the stat I thought was interesting is that poor people are thirty at thirty four percent, whereas non poor or twenty eight percent. Well, it makes a lot of sense, you know. Um the uh, the poor usually have less access to a healthy diet, right, Uh, usually less time to eat well or take care of themselves since they're working. Cheaper packaged foods and I are loaded with sodium and podium and salt. It's a big contributor to high blood pressure. So that kind of does make sense. Well, Chuck, why don't you tell us some ways that we can avoid hypertension? And if you have hypertension, I mean, what can you do? Well? Uh? Kind of like with everything else, the doctor tells you eat healthy, lose weight, lay off the salt, limit alcohol, and quit smoking. Yeah, and I looked into smoking. Uh, you know, it turns out that smoking I thought it would stimulate the heart and would wear it out faster. It turns out that doesn't happen. Smoking actually goes in and injures your blood vessels. That's how smoking can cause heart disease and hypertension, which I found interesting. But yeah, you want to stay away from the cigarettes, the cigars, any kind of smoking is going to be bad for your heart, right, And as far as your diet goes, they have something they recommend called the DASH diet d A s H stands for Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension. And uh, what you want to eat is whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts. You want to limit fats and red meat. So not some much bacon, huh, not as much bacon, steak, stuff like that. Yeah, it's a nice it's a nice treat, but that shouldn't be your regular, agreed, chuck. So what happens if you do have hypertension? I mean obviously that there's a there's a lot of medications out there in the market for people who are hypertensive, right, Yeah, there's a lot of medications, but a lot of these have side effects too, so it depends on how higher blood pressure is as to whether or not a doctor thinks it's worth it to get on these meds um and potentially suffer some side effects. So it's a few points here and there. They'll probably recommend that you take care of it through diet and exercise if you have a real problem. Um, there's all kinds of anti hypertensive drugs, diuretics, uh, sympathetic inhibitors UH, calcium channel inhibitors, a C inhibitors, and you know they'll do a good job. But you know side effects like sedation, nightmares, depression, vertigo, uh, stuff like that. The effects. Yeah, my favorite side effect death. Yeah. I love it when they say that as pharmaceuticals. Well, you mentioned sympathetic inhibitors. Is that that would have to do with the sympathetic nervous system, right, Yeah, that would control your fight or flight response correct, right, which is something that we like to talk about under fight or flight response. Well, if you do have hypertension and you are being treated for it, take hope. I read somewhere that six of people who suffer from hypertension recover from it. They gain control of their blood pressure. It's goods. Go see your doctor, eat well, quit smoking, watch the booze all that, and Uh, if you want to learn a lot more about hypertension, read hypertension in depth on how stuff works dot com and stick around to find out how Chuck and I know that the world about in right after this stuff you should know is brought to you by Visa. We all have things to think about, like say, what's the best sight to buy a new leather jacket, or whether to buy the three or six megapixel camera. But thankfully we don't need to think about online fraud because for every purchase you make, Visa keeps an eye out for fraud with real time fraud monitoring and by making sure you're not liable for any unauthorized purchases. How's that for peace of mind? Safe? Secure Visa so check. You want to tell everybody how we're privy to the information that the world's about to end, well, Josh, is not because we're smarter than everyone else, because that's not true. Uh, it's because we read the article. Are frogs on the brink of extinction? That's true. Frogs are an indicator species, and when they start disappearing, everybody else at the top of the food chains in big, big trouble. So this is something you might want to do a little research on. Go Type in our frogs on the brink of extinction in the search bar how stuff works dot com for more on this and thousands of other topics. Does it how stuff works dot com. Let us know what you think.
