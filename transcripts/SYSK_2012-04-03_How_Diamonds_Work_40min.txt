Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles t. W Chuck Bryant and uh where Stuff you Should Know Crew with the Juice Crew, Big Daddy Kane. I'm Big Daddy Kane. All right, I'm Biz Markie. I'll take it. You're red headed King Pim. Yes, okay, you don't remember that guy. No. Sorry, we're still talking about our music sampling podcast, which we just recorded. Instead, we're gonna talk about something else, something called diamonds. I kind of hate diamonds. Now, by the way, do you this is this article is? Yeah? Well I thought it was good, but after reading all this stuff, I'm just like, it's just a big false market. Well, i mean, they're still pretty, but yeah, they have a lot of they got a lot of problems, all right, Chuck. Yes, have you ever heard of a magazine called The Atlantic? Yeah? I used to get that. Have you ever heard of a year called nine eight two? Okay, well, in nineteen eighty two, in that magazine, The Atlantic didn't. I didn't either. I was six. I wasn't reading The Atlantic yet. I came when I was ten. Um. In nineteen two, a guy named ever j Epstein wrote an article for The Atlantic called have You ever Tried to Sell the Diamond? And I got this from Neto Rama by the way, um. And in the in the article he wrote about someone else who who conducted an experiment to try to find out what's going on with the aftermarket for diamonds. Right. So this guy for magazine called Money, which magazine I don't understand the name at all. Um. In nineteen seventy Uh, the guy bought a one point four two carrot diamond for seven five pounds. That's a pretty good deal these days, but back then I would say it was an average price. Right. So he waits for a year to allow it to appreciate, because supposedly diamonds appreciate in value, right, And then he takes it around to all of the gem dealers in London and the highest offer he got for what he paid the year before seven pounds was five d sixty eight pounds. So he's like, huh, I want to figure out what maybe if I let it appreciate a little longer, it will work. And this guy obviously had other freelance work in the meantime, because he waited until nineteen seventy four and did it again. This time he finds out that his diamond shrunk from one point four two carrots to one point oh four carets because one of the dealers switched the diamond out on him when he was having it a praise V one. That's not even the worst. The guy buys another diamond one point four carrots, right, takes it around. He buys it for two thousand pounds in four I think, Um, he waited a week, it took it around, and the highest offergot was a thousand pounds hemorrhaging money. Right. But the point is is the reason why these things are like cadillacs the moment you drive them off a lot and they never come back and value is because there is no aftermarket. And the reason that there is no aftermarket for for diamonds is because of one single diamond cartel and their advertising campaigns to beers um, which we'll talk about in this But there's a lot more to diamonds than just all the shady business. The monopolies and the cartels and the artificial markets created. There is billions of years of history. One of the cool things about a diamond is that when you're wearing this, when looking at a diamond holding it, you're beholding possibly a mineral that's that was created a billion years ago. That is cool, very cool. I love that, and I very much appreciate the craftsmanship what goes into making a diamond in its final form, because, as every kid knows, diamonds are as hard as it kids supposedly, and they're a girl's best friend. That's another thing too. There's a lot of slogans around diamonds, all created by the beers. Let's let's talk about diamonds. Where are they made of? Because they're so expensive, it must be made up of like kryptonite and um in diamond and yeah, in diamonds, no, Josh, you know you're benkoy. They are made of carbon. It is basically carbon, and it's most concentrated form. And carbon is a pretty common elements, one of the four essential ingredients to life. We breathe it. We're made up of carbon. Pencils are like at least sixty carbon uh, and diamonds if you want to get down to brass, acts are not rare at all. Um. There are many many more precious gems that are much rarer than diamonds, including some types of diamonds. Colored diamonds what we're mainly talking about, and this one is transparent diamonds typical like white diamonds. But yeah, colored diamond and naturally colored diamond is nice. So um ice, let's call it ice? Yeah? Or bling? Do you remember when bling used to be called bling bling? Like there were two blings bling bling? No? Did they just shorten it to one bling at some point? Who's they? Who decides the stuff? Mtvay Urban Dictionary. Yeah? Um, so you've got carbon. It's pretty uh, pretty ubiquitous, Yes, very abundant. It naturally occurs in three forms, right, graphite, diamond fairly soft, diamond, very hard, and then fullerite John fullerite, which is uh. It's a mineral made of per quickly spherical molecules of exactly sixty carbon atoms, and it was only recently discovered and supposedly diamonds are no longer the strongest um mineral. Somebody synthetically figured out how to um combine fuller right, into and know something else and it's like eleven harder than diamonds on the most depth scale. Sorry, by that that sampling episode really had an effect the rest of the day. Then it's carrying over UM diamonds. Uh So basically, if you have graphite, you have a misformed diamond. Is one way to look at it. Diamonds form under very specific conditions UM that are found typically about a hundred miles or a hundred and sixty one kilometers beneath the Earth's surface in the mantle. As long as temperatures are above four I'm sorry, as long as temperatures are seven hundred and fifty two degrees fahrenheit four hundred degrees saleseness UM, and there's at least four hundred and thirty five thousand, one hundred and thirteen pounds per square inch of pressure, you will form diamond when there's carbon, and carbon will make a diamond. If either of those two things are not met, you're gonna get graphite. Right. So these diamonds that we're looking at today, like we said, reformed like fifty million, hundred millions up to billions of years ago under these conditions, and UM more recently say I think twenty million, between twenty million and one point one billion years ago, heavy magma um eruptions that are about three times from depths, about three times that that blew up Mount St. Helen. Um pushed diamonds towards the surface and form what are called kimberlight pipes. Magma is one of my favorite works, by the way, I don't know why. Uh yeah, And basically they act as like an elevator and they pushed the diamonds and other stuff up through the mantle. Happened very quickly, over a matter of hours. And but it's all underground, so it's not like it wasn't like a mounta Saint Helens. It's still impressive. It's very impressive. Um. The magma cooled inside the pipes and left behind these veins of kimber light rock, and that's where the diamonds are, right, and kimber lights bluish and I guess the diamonds are inside the kimber light. Yeah. I looked up kimber light and that's what it looked like. It looked like a big bluish rock with spots of crystals, right, and you crack that open, you have raw diamonds. That's right. Uh, that's not the only place you can find diamonds, though. You can find them alluvial diamond sits or river beds that were originally they all came from from the mantle, but they get pushed around by things like glaciers and water and they can end up thousands of miles from where they started. Those are called alluvial diamond sights. That's yeah. Did you say that that did? Are you sure? I'm positive I don't think you did. Um. Diamonds, like you said, they're not as rare as they have been artificially made to be. They can be found all over the world. Um. Some of the major sites are in Russia, Borneo, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Venezuela, Canada. Yeah, I didn't know that, um. And they're often found in these things called archie and cratons in the center of a continent. Well, Africa too, we gotta say Africa. Oh yeah, it's Africa's huge. I think come from Africa for sure. I can't believe I left that out. And that's right, um. But if you you're more likely to find diamonds in the center of the continent, and these things called archaean cratons, cratons and archie and craton is basically a horizontal piece of earth that is kind of relatively immune to geological events like earthquakes and tech tonic movement and all that. And this is usually a pretty good site to find diamonds. Yeah, it says here they've they're found in the center of most of the seven continents, six of them. Yeah, Like, why don't they just say there's only seven things. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Okay, Um, when they find diamonds, Josh, they're rough. Have you ever seen a big rough diamond stone? It's crystal on TV? Yeah, it doesn't look like much. It looks like a crystal like that you would dig up from the earth. There's like yeah, um, but you have to process it, um obviously by by carbon the sucker up and then making it pretty and then making it shiny, right, which is quite get specifically into that, but that's that's the base basics. Well, you said, um, that's one of the things you like about diamonds is the cristmanship. Yeah, and it takes a while. You want to talk about it, all right, Cutting diamonds Josh, which again, this is not the easiest thing in the world to do, and it takes special tape nicks. Like cleaving. Yeah, this is my favorite cleaving is when they they take the diamond as it is weak, it's point, which is the tetrahedral plane. We'll talk about that in a second. Oh you know about that because I looked it up and I can only come to guesses about what that is. Oh, well, I don't know what the plane is, but I know, I just figured it was the point where the well, I guess, I don't know, so sort of assumed it was where that there were fewer links of the atoms. Yeah, I think like so the lattice, the lattice um connection between carbon atoms and the diamond is what makes it strong. So each carbon atom is connected to four others instead of just one. It's like the the five side of a dice of a die. Right, I connect all those and you have your You're on your way to forming a diamond. Whereas with carbon or graphite um, the five are connected in a ring, so one's only connected to one other one, which is why it's weaker. Right, But if you look, if you kind of plot out um a tetrahedral um lattice work of carbon atoms. If you go straight across, there's a point where each of them where you're only cutting through one atom at the time, there's only one connection. Yeah, that's gotta be it. Then, that's what I would think it is. That's my guess. I think you're right, Josh. So they find this tetrahedral plane where it's weakest, and they hold the diamond in like cement or wax or something. They cut a little groove and then they put a steel blade in that groove and in one big whack they cleave this sucker into two pieces. And I'll bet that is nerve wracking work. I couldn't find a video of it. Oh yeah, I could imagine it's probably pretty well guarded. I mean I saw an old video from like old black and white thing, but it was I don't know if there was a new method now or whatever. Uh. Then, Uh, sometimes you can't just cleave it. Sometimes there's no plane of weakness and you have to saw it. And there's probably always a plane of weakness in the diamond. But for the angle that you're trying to get too, I imagine that there's not necessarily going you you can't find that tetrahedral plane. Yeah, because you're cutting it in specific places for a reason. You're not just like, hey, let me cut the sucker in two. You're cutting it very specifically for what you want the end result to be, whether it's I want to get five different cut diamonds out of this single rock or whatever. Yeah, And you need to think like that many steps ahead. And for each diamond, you the first thing you do is figure out where the table is, which is the top of the diamond. It's the most exposed surface area. And then you figure out what the girdle is and that is the part of the diamond with the largest diameter. Um. And once you once you established those two things and everything else, it just makes sense because there's just a certain way to cut diamonds and can go crazy make like a squirrel. Diamonds are shaped like diamonds exactly. That interesting. Yeah. Um, So you've got you've got cleaving, you've got sawing and sawing. You're using a special tool called the phosphor bronze blade. That rope, it's a RPMs. I did see this online. That's crazy. It's pretty crazy. Um, you can also use a laser, but that takes forever. Um. Yeah, I got the feeling lasers aren't really the way to go, which is surprising. I thought it'd be like whoop, yeah exactly. You know, I've seen seen James Bond movies. Lasers can you all sorts of cool stuff? Uh, if you want to shape your diamond, which you will want to do if you ever want to sell it. Um, if it's one of the lucky of diamonds, because I think it's only that actually make it to market. Oh is it that? Yeah, used for like sol blades and other industrial uses, embraces, embraces, Yeah, diamond dust bowls, racis, pianos. Brooding or cutting gives the diamond the shape, and brooding is when you do it by hand, and cutting is when you use a machine. And I couldn't find out how many diamonds are hand cut, like percentage wise. I'm curious about that. I don't know if it's a lost art or if that just means it's a higher quality because it's handcut. Do you know, No, I don't. Both of them seem to use uh a lot of human intervention though. Brooding and cutting and other diamonds to brooding is kind of like taking two pipes, filling them with cement and then putting a diamond in it so that there's just a little bit sticking out and then rubbing him together using a diamond to cut of diamond, which is the only thing you can cut a diamond with. Do you want to talk about the most scale real quick? Yeah, because you can only cut a diamond the diamond because as we said, UM, it's pretty much the hardest substance on Earth, right, anything but beneath that is not going to scratch it. And there's actually um a scale to uh describe the strength of um minerals by a guy named Friedrich Mose. Yeah, the Mose Hardness scale. Yeah, and he was a German mineral mineral ologists, mineralogist jee man from the thirties. I think who created this scale goes from one to ten or although you said now eleven, I guess it goes to eleven. Well, it's eleven percent harder than diamond, so it's got to be above diamond, right, it's gotta be above diamond level. Platinum level. We start out with talc. You can scratch talk with your fingernail it's such a wimpy little thing. Gypsum you can scratch with your fingernail barely calcite. You can scratch it with a copper coin and it scratches a copper coin, okay, which is a measurement. And it's quite a duel. Yeah, I'll get you yoursite versus copper fluora. You cannot get scratched by copper coin. And it does not scratch glass. It just kind of sits there. Yeah, doing this thing. Um appetite. I think it is appetite. Appetite either way, I'm hungry. Um. It scratches glass sort of, or just scratches glass, and it's easily scratched by a knife. I remember when I was a kid, I didn't understand what the word barely meant. And I was playing kick ball in one of like the older kids. Is like, man, just go out there and just barely kicked the ball, and he's telling me to bunt. Basically he kicked it like a bear would. No, I thought, barely meant like to just just barely miss it, not just barely make contact with something. So I kept going out there and like just perfectly barely missing it, and the kid was going crazy. I'm like, I don't understand you. You're in my yard. Go home? Is that your excuse for why I struck out a kickball growing up? I struck out at t ball even Yeah, and like they give you like six strikes and they still would be like ghost, sit down, Josh. That makes me feel bad. Um Ortho Clays Josh is number six, um quartz is number seven. Then you got topaz, correndum, courrond, dumber is like sapphires and rubies, and then the diamond and that is the most hardness scale and um so as you can see, since diamonds the last because the most scale hasn't been updated. Uh the you have to use a diamond to cut a dime, which some of those the industrial uses of diamonds is diamond cutting tools. Yeah. I have a diamond sal blade, nuts be rolling in it. I'm loaded, dude. It also has diamonds just bedazzled all over the saw itself. Uh So, we talked about brooding and then cutting. You would use a lathe, which is something that spins it around very fast. That's one of my favorite words. Lathe. I used to work with the wood lathe back in the day, a lot of fun and then you want to polish it if you want to. By the way, there's only five major cutting centers in the world. Yeah, Like, if you're gonna get your diamonds cut, they get shipped to New York, Bombay, Israel, Antwerp, or Johannesburg generally Johannesburg either way. So, like I said, you want to polish it because you want it all shiny and pretty, and uh, it's a polishing wheel coated with once again diamond powder. Are you starting to see a pattern here? Diamonds cut diamonds. Um. So, once you once your diamonds cut and you say, hey, this is pretty good diamond, I'm going to try to sell it to somebody for you know, too much money, right exactly. Um. One of the things that you're going to use to describe this diamond and increase its value are the four seas. Right, You've got cut, clarity, carrot, and color. And we'll start with cut. So basically cut is how well the diamonds cut and what shape it's cut in. There's all sorts of different cuts, including the most confusing of all, the emerald cut diamond UM, and the one we're referring to initially was I think just the round cut. That's like the standard diamond shape. So you got cut right, you have clarity and that measures UM. The diamonds natural flaws, so um you have the flaws are also called inclusions, and you have a flawless down to slightly included in between you have very very slight, very slight and then slightly and then there's different degrees of that like vs one VVS two s I two, and it just keeps going until you're like you need to we'll use this as as a sol blade. I like a little flaw in my diamond. Well, that's nice, Chuck. That just shows what kind of guy I am. That's also a way that diamonds are catalog like a specific diamond is cataloged and tract is by its inclusions because they're frequently for for diamonds, they're solding as gem stones there. The flaws are so infrequent that they're almost like um birthmarks, right, They're they're birth marks for diamonds. Uh. Carrot Josh is the third scene, and that is the weight a carrot is about two d milligrams, right, and that actually came out of India. Um. The carib seed was used as a weight for um for diamonds, and that be and carrot instead of ca. And then you've got color, and we're talking about transparent diamonds. So basically what you've got is totally colorless, which means it's a carbon. There's no other mineral or element in this diamond um all the way to h a light yellow and that's ranked but from d diz so weird. I've never understood that. I don't know. There's a lot I don't understand about diamonds. And then you also have transparency, luster, and dispersion of light. Fire, yeah, fire, that's right, fire. I think brilliance and then the other word for it, probably and that's all dispersion of light. Yeah, I think virus, which is means you can see different you know, when you hold it up to light, you see different colors, and it's like the discobalt quality of the diamond exactly. Um. So we we also mentioned that the truly rare diamonds are colored ones and they come in like a rainbow of expense tons. Yeah, there's black diamonds, there's yellow diamonds. Even though transparent diamonds go down to light yellow. Those aren't yellow diamonds. Yellow diamonds, yellow diamond They're awesome. Um, you've got pale green, pink pinker popular with rich people. What I've seen they go with. I think j Lo had a big pink diamond from one of her husbands. Is that right? I think so? I don't. I don't know why I knew that. You benefit. You know how things get caught up in your brain that should not be there, and then you can't forget it no matter what. Now you'll always remember that. M hold on, I'm getting rid of it right now. Shoot, donkey eating grass and done. Okay. Um, so let's talk about the history and why diamonds are. I haven't always been so popular with the Americans. Um, they were not always a an engagement ring. No. Before that, it was like colored Joe stone, like a nice looking ruby. Yeah, well, why wouldn't you give that to somebody? You like to look at it? It's gorgeous. And then the Beers came about. That's right. De Beers is a cartel. If you don't know what, a cartel is founded by a Mr Rhodes, who um Rhodesia is named after, and the Rhodes scholarship, and the Beers is the family name of the people whose farm he bought initially in South Africa. If you don't know what a cartel is, it is a syndicate of competing firms that all gets together and says, hey, let's fix prices on all our stuff, create a monopoly and let's run the show. Yes, and that's what De Beers is. It is a consult De Beers Consolidated Minds Ltd pretty much says it all. It's the all the different uh well, not all. Up until like two thousand it was mostly all Yeah. I think that's something like of all the diamonds are controlled by them. They produced he used to be, but they also go around and buy up diamonds from the market and sit on them and then every year through these things called um sites. I think the sales because there's only two people, are groups that are licensed to buy from the Beers and they have like I think ten sales a year where they say you're you. Two hundred people are are allowed to come buy diamonds from us. And they so tightly control the market that they control the price of diamonds, and that's why diamonds are so expensive ten weeks out of the year. That's it, is it, right? And they could buy in packages from I think like one to two million or something like that of uncut diamonds and then the site holders take them to go get created by people who cleave. That's right. Uh. And in two thousand um I said that their monopoly sort of ended. Um Russia, Canada, Australia basically said enough of this and they went outside to beers, and that in really ended their big monopoly, although they still what is it, half the world diamond supply and they control about two thirds of the whole world market, right, but it used to be close to how did they do this, Chuck? How does the company do this? I mean obviously by buying diamonds, but how did they take the diamond and make it the this precious sowed after Gemstone. Well, when you control supply, obviously you can say it's rare. But then they did it through clever marketing. Basically, as about all there was to it. Diamond diamond is Forever in the nineteen forties was voted in two thousand as the ad campaign slogan of the twentieth century. That's pretty big. That's huge. And that that basically sold the American public and Japan. Japan in the sixties America in the late forties sold them on the fact that a diamond was, uh what you needed to save up two months salary for and uh and spend on your wife for her engagement right or on your fiance right. Um. And then following that the beers said, hey, we should get rid of the aftermarket. And they said, by the way, that diamond you bought is an engagement, that's a family heirloom. You want to hang on to that, which keeps diamonds off of the market. And it's what's so, this is why I said I don't like diamonds. It's just none of it was true. Yeah. It was just a cartel that got together and said we're gonna snow the American and Japanese public on the fact that these are really rare, precious gems, when they should have just said, you know what, we've got lots of diamonds actually and appreciate the craftsmanship and pay a decent price for it and everyone's happy. It doesn't sound like something the beers would say. Um. So, in addition to the fact that the industry is virtually controlled by a cartel. Um diamonds also have. They routinely get bad pressed for um conflict diamonds blood diamonds, which are essentially diamonds that are mined illegally to fund as far as UM. The people who oversee such things rebel groups there are that seek to destabilize legitimate governments. Right, yeah, we have a whole article on that. I think, Yeah, I think our blood diamond's making a comeback, comeback or something. Yeah. Um, So they've come up with this thing called the the what is it, the Kimberly the Kimberly process certification scheme and scheme. And I hate it when they use scheme like that, even though it's correct, it always sounds bad and the use words scheme, but it's really just a plan. And they call it the Kimberly Process. The u N and the Conflict Free Diamond Council got together to basically monitor the diamond at every point of its production process, so they know basically the birth certificate of the diamond all the way through to the until it's on the little ladies finger. So supposedly that's what's supposed to happen, but really, what the Kimberly Um. The Kimberley process entails now is getting governments to control their imports and exports of diamonds and certify them. So like if you are shipping a certification or a bunch of diamonds that each in each diamond doesn't have a certification, you can't get the shipment. Um. You're supposed to package them in tamper free UM or tamper proof uh containers, So people can't slip blood diamonds into these shipments mid shipment. Yeah, that makes sense, um, But the problem is what you were saying, like they control every aspect. That's not true, cutting, polishing, um, all of these things aren't overseen. Yeah, which leads to a lot of possibility. You can introduce blood diamonds at the beginning of this stream and they just become bona fide through a shipment. So when the u N says that they're ninety nine point eight percent of diamonds now and market are conflict free, is that not Also the other criticism of the Kimberly processes, it depends on your your definition of conflicts. The u N and the Kimberly scheme people well are basically saying it's a rebel group that can produce a blood diamond and this is a this is a human rights organization above all else. But they're turning a blind eye to human rights abuses by these legitimate governments like Robert Mugabe's um government of Zimbabwe. Hugo Chavez apparently his government in Venezuela has some human right abuses regarding diamonds, but these are still considered legitimate diamonds, not blood diamonds, even though they are still conflict diamonds. Well, in uh two thousand one, UM Bill Clinton signed Executive Order one which basically said America is not no longer gonna get any roughs from Sierra Leone. And then uh W came along later that year and signed another executive order saying no more RUSS from Liberia. And then in two thousand three, we passed in the United States the Clean Diamond Trade Act, which supposedly has legis slation that helps implement in the Kimberly process. Yeah, and it sounds like a big scam. Now, if you buy it's not a scam, it's just flawed. It has inclusions to say that um and if you buy a diamond you can UM, you can request to see it's UM kimberly processed certificate. UM. Another way to get around this all together, to make sure that there's no way that your blood, that your diamonds of blood diamond is to buy synthetic. Yeah, and there's plenty of them, plenty of different varieties out there, yep. Growing up in the seventies, we all heard about the Cubic Zirconia the c Z and uh it's a lab gym that was made in a lab and it's been on the market since seventy six. Yeah, the Russians created it, right, Yeah, and it's hard. It's an eight point five on the most scale. Um. And the problem with the c Z is it's too perfect, Yeah, so perfect. It looks fake. It's like the diamond that hit the Uncanny Valley, right, Like there's something wrong with it because it's just too good. So, I mean it looks artificial when you look at it, because it is. They have manufactured it too perfectly. So nowadays sometimes they will put slight inclusions in there, which is just so funny. That's like the like the new stuff that like the hat you get at Abercombie, that's fraid I'm the bill. Um. There's also moistonite, which is named after Dr Henri Moisson, who discovered diamonds in a meteorite in Arizona in and somehow managed to replicate it. Yeah, and if if it was just moisonite, like the natural moistonite, it would be one of the rarest things on the planet, the asteroid version of the meteorite version. Yeah, the non man made moistonite um, because it's essentially just silicon carbide. But it's really really rare to get the real thing. It's like a crystallized version of diamonds. Yeah. And so in the eighties, come an called cre Incorporated developed a way of producing silicon carbide crystals, and moistonite was now available as of the late nineties too, you know, to take the place of your natural diamond are they I couldn't get a price on those. I don't think moizonite is cheap. Uh, I don't know. I know that man made diamonds that's a different class. It's a different category from even moistonite. Yeah, Moissonite and cubics arconia are synthetic man made. No manmade is synthetic. Cubans cubic zarconia moistenite are simulants. They're not actually made from carbon. Manmade diamonds are made from carbon, but they're made in a few days rather than you know, eons um and they are structurally diamonds, so much of that the Deemological Institute of America recognizes them as diamonds. But they sell for about thirty of a natural diamond um and those are I guess, second most expensive. So I would think moisture night is cheaper than that, probably, And uh uh. The man made are sometimes so hard to tell apart from the real thing that gemalogists can't even tell, and jewelers can't tell. And so they are now selling machines that helped jewelers determine whether or not it's a real diamond or it's man made. And who makes that machine? Josh, I couldn't begin to guess. The beers the beers in November last year, um late last year, the Anglo American company which the Global Mining Company acquired. Oh, it was the Oppenheimer family who was one of the original the Oppenheimer fun people. Now it was from the They were one of the original families for the de Beers Cartel, I think. Um, but they bought out the Oppenheimer families of their Steak into Beers for five point one billion dollars in cash and cash, yeah, not like stock certificates or future promises. And now they raised their steak to because they already had forty five So the Oppenheimer's are a longer part of that, but they are rolling in the cash. They went straight. Um. I think we would be remissed. There's plenty of famous diamonds, but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about probably the most famous diamond, the Hope Diamond. The Pink Panther. Is that real? I don't know. It was a real movie. Yeah, A really good movie about a diamond in a great cartoon. Yeah. Um, but the Hope Diamond. Have you seen it at the Smithsonian which is big, um? And it was there. It has a curse associated with it, you know that. Um. There was a newspaper in nineteen eleven. Um. Well, I guess several of them wrote about the curse of the Hope Diamond. That's when it started to come about. Um. And in a book in the Mystery of the Hope Diamond. Really like kind of established its um lower in popular culture. But UM starting with a guy named Jean Baptiste Tavernier. He stole the Hope Diamond and was um torn apart by wild dogs. That was the first bad thing that happened associated with the Hope Diamond. Uh. Louis lost his head during the revolution. Louis his head, Yeah, Louis the fourteenth had it. He died of gang green Um. George the fourth died deep in debt UM. All the way to UH, one of my favorites uh Mademoiselle laurens Ldu borrowed the diamond from her lover Ivan, who had been murdered by Russian revolutionaries, and she was murdered before he could be murdered by Russian revolutionaries. UM. And then all the way down to the Abdul Hamid, the second Sultan of Turkey. He paid four grand for it, and it just brought horrible luck to everybody, from his um, his favorite member of his harem, to his royal guards UM. And then finally Harry Winston got his hands on it from Pierre Cartier, and Harry Winston decided to just end it all and send this thing to the Smithsonian and he sent the Hope Diamond just regular postal. Regular post didn't tell him it was coming. I mean they knew that they were negotiating. He's like, okay, I'll send it, and it just arrived very unceremoniously. And a guy named James Todd is the mailman who brought it Hope Diamond to the Smithsonian. And um, he later crushed his leg in a truck accident, his head was injured in an automobile accident, and he lost his home in a fire. I'm not laughing at him. Boy, the Madden Curse has nothing on that. No, that's crazy, no way. So that's it for diamonds. Do you got anything else? What are we at? Like an hour and a half now, okay, let's end it. Then. Um, if you want to learn more about diamonds, type diamond into the search bar. How stuff works, like to common opening up a lot cool stuff? And I said search bar. So it's not for a listener mail. Yeah. In addition to diamonds, it was blood diamonds, and there was an also an article about diamond thieves. I'm wanna look into that, have you? Yeah, I was kind of a history of diamond thoughts it wasn't um okay this from Liz, and I'm gonna call this pickpocketing. For spring break, during my junior year of high school, I went to Europe as a part of a group trip organized by my school's art club. There were maybe thirty of us in total, spending three days each in London, Paris, and Madrid. Before we left, our art teacher, who had put together the entire trip, warned us repeatedly about pickpockets. We even had an in club project where we made little bags for our passports to hang around our necks and under our shirts. During this trip, we did have occasional brushes with suspicious people, including one lady who stepped onto a crowded subway train, pushed against my mother, and immediately started unzipping her purse, which was hanging in front of her. When she saw my mom looking to eckly at her, she turned and walked off the train right before the doors closed, about five or six seconds in that entire exchange. The big story, though, was one night in Madrid where a group of the adult chaperones and anyone old enough to drink went out to a pub. By sheer chance. The Swedish rugby team was also there that night. The smallest among them was about six ft six and they were all built like mac trucks. And they were already very drunk and very rowdy, but also very friendly. So you got big, burly, drunk friendly rugby. Uh they were Swedish, yes, but that was a handsome group of guys. Now I had went back to our hotel, but this was the story related to me. Our our teacher was chatting with the coach of the rugby team. She felt a hand reached inside of her purse. She grabbed at it as it was pulling out, and realized that the pickpocket had her wallet, passport, and two passports of my classmates. The entire team rushed the guy and took him outside, where they recovered at least two other wallets that have been stolen at the same bar. I can't say what else they did, but I'm fairly certain he wasn't picking any pockets for a while. That is from Liz in Philadelphia, a k a. New York LIGHTE. Nice. Thank you very much, Liza. It was a pretty cool It's a good pickpocketing story, and go Swedish rugby team for beating up people. Who's steal. Yeah, any anybody who beats up people who's steal It's pretty great. Unless it's one of those kind of like morally gray things from Lameyserab. You know it's tough yet.
