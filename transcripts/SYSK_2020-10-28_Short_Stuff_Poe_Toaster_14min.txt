Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short Stuff. I'm Josh and there's Chuck, and it's just the two of us, just a couple of a couple of hanchos, a couple of ombres, just doing our thing, rattling off facts in a superspeedy manner with a limited amount of time. So this is short stuff, so we don't want to waste time with long intros saying unnecessary thing right exactly? Uh so the po toaster. Huh is this the beginning of our spooky content? Yes, it is, if that's okay with you. Yeah, it's our favorite month. I love October, I love Halloween. I've been sitting on this one since last year. Actually, have you heard of this guy before? Now? And and obviously I didn't just ask Chuck everybody if he's sort of ed Growl and Poe. We're talking about a corollary to the po legend. Everybody knows about Poe, the master author, the creator of the short story um, believed to be the first person to ever write a genuine detective story, Ed Gralan Poe. Everybody knows about him. We're not talking about just him, no, but we are talking about his dead body, Yeah, which Pope would love. Oh, he would totally love it he died, and he probably would even love dying under mysterious circumstance. There's no way he didn't. He was probably like, as they were dragging him out of the street, he was probably like, this so great. Well, he was forty years old. This was an eighty nine and he was buried in Westminster Burying Ground in Baltimore, where he made his home. And it was kind of not a big deal at the time as far as you know, paying tribute. He had an unmarked gray for a while. Finally a relative stepped up and said, can we at least get you know, his name carved into something. He just showed up with a stick and carved it in the dirt. It he may have, yeah, but yeah, it was. He was still fairly obscure enough that he yeah, he was able to first be buried in the on Mark grave. But some local academics started to recognize the man's genius and they actually held like an early go fund me to to create a monument for pose Um grave actually, and they were successful finally in eighteen seventy five, that's right, So they had a monument carved it was Um. He was actually moved. It was dedicated on a on a space a little more befitting one of the great authors of his time. And they, you know, they exhumed him, moved the body, and about ten years after that his wife and his mother in law were buried along with him, which is sort of key in this story. And hopefully he wasn't like a Fred Flintstone type where that would have really bothered him to have his mother in law so close by for eternity. Instead, I have the feeling that it was a very sweet gesture, sure so that you would think, well, that's it there there, That's the most you could possibly say about pose remains laying in the ground at a grave. Not true. That was the case from about eight to eighteen forty or nineteen forty nine, i should say. And then allegedly on that year, the centennial of his death, UM, he was visited by somebody who came to be known as the Poe Toaster, a mysterious stranger who showed up at his grave on his birthday January nine every year, dressed in an all black suit, a white scarf, and a big black, wide brimmed hat to cover his face. And created this ritual out of whole cloth that eventually attracted the notice of people in Baltimore. Yeah, so what would happen is this man presumably would show up with a bottle of cognac and literally toast po and leave three red roses along with that bottle. Uh, they are not. And this would happen sometime between usually midnight and six am. So it was even led more to the creepiness of the whole thing. Yea, and no one did anything about it. No one said, hey, grab that guy and let's see who it is, get his rip off that hat and expose him. Right, it's Roy Kane. But um, so what happened was, well, first of all, we should address the cognac. No one was exactly sure why he toasted with kognac, even though I read very quickly on the Internet that Poe loved kognac. Wasn't in his stories. Yeah, he supposedly loved it, but couldn't afford it unless someone else was buying, because you know, he didn't he didn't get rich, right, So yeah, a lot of people are like, well, he should be using a mantiato because obviously the cask of Amontiado is one of his great stories. I don't know why he would be using cognac. Apparently now we do know why. You just solve that mystery for me, Chuck, Thank you. What about those roses? So he would leave three roses on the grave, like you said, and they've people have come to believe that that's a gesture to to Um to give a rose to each of the people who are buried beneath that monument, Poe, his wife, Virginia, and his mother in law Maria. UM. So that one's probably the likeliest explanation of that. Should we take a break? I think we should, Um, but first will reveal the identity of the po Toaster after this. How's that for a cliffhanger? Pretty great? So I totally lied on the cliffhanger. Um. No one knows who the Poe Toaster is as far as we can tell, and we certainly don't, so there will be no revealing. We just wanted to keep you tuned in. Well, I mean, there is one guy who claims he was the Poe Toaster, and two thousand seven, a ninety two year old man named Sam Porpora claimed it was him. He was a former ad executive and he in nineteen sixty was made history in Westminster Presbyterian Church, which was apparently in disrepair at the time and kind of just full of people getting drunk and you know, uh, not treating the graves with respect. So he claims he did it as a promotional thing to sort of raise money in publicity, and it was he and his tour guides. Uh, this gentleman Jeff Jerome, who was the curator of the Poe Museum. I think his quote was there are holes big enough in his story you could drive a mack truck through. So I couldn't find those holes. I couldn't, Like, I looked everywhere and I couldn't find him specifically saying why he did not think it was him. Well, so Jeff Jerome has kind of become like the de facto historian of the Poe Toaster because he ran the po Historical Society for a while or the Poem Museum. I'm sorry, um, and a lot of people put a lot of weight into what he says. He claims that he had worked out a um signal with the po Toaster so that the po Toaster would signal him and let him know that he was the real deal, because over the years, there were right, there were, um, there were what are known as photoasters who people who pretended to be the Poe Toaster after the thing be kind kind of became a big deal, um starting in the seventies. Um, so that Jeff Jerome at least would know it was the real article. Um. But he swears up and down and most people believe him that he has no idea the actual identity of the Poe Toaster. The only interaction he'd had with the po Toasters at was grave on these specific nights over the years. Yeah. And I wonder why Sam Porpora would come forward and claim to be such so late in life. And they even asked him that in this article, and he said, like why he came forward and he went, I don't know. Uh, yeah, that's not a very good Yeah that that's a big hole in your story right there. To not have a motivation. Yeah, if you're somebody who who starts out and here's the thing like this, This whole Poe Toaster thing became a kind of a cause celeb in in Baltimore and places outside of Baltimore. People would show up and there'd be little groups of onlookers who would watched this thing every year. Um, and like you said, very coolly, never tried to find out who it was. They just respected it from and watched from a distance. Um. So it kind of became like this this cool thing. But this guy was doing this for decades before it became a cool thing. So of course there's some sort of motivation behind all this, And people who do stuff like they have a motivation behind everything they're doing. There's some larger meaning or some something to what they're doing. So, yeah, he would I don't believe the poet Toaster would have come forward just for I don't know. Well, I mean, he said he said why he did it. He didn't say why he came forward and invited that he was the Poe Toaster. Yeah, I don't buy that kind story. Who knows I buy it. I think it makes sense as a former ad guy. But at any rate, the and he was on the scene as well as the historian of the church, so anyway, I think it's Uh. I think there's a lot of credence there. But at any rate, the the gentleman, whoever it was, would leave these notes occasionally, and one note in said the torch will be passed it to be read in creepy Vincent Price voice when read out loud. Uh. And then there was one that said the toaster had died, and there was a theory, and I think Jeff Jerome buys the theory that, um, the torch was passed to his sons because they kind of did a uh they were sort of lackadaisical about how spirited they were with their efforts. Let's just say that was that was a really diplomatic way to put it. Yeah. Sometimes they would show up in street clothes, and from what I've gathered, like the the minimum criteria for being the Poe toaster is that all black suit, white scarf and a huge hat. That's yeah, there's a certain amount of dapperness that needs to be brought to this. And showing up in like jeans and vans and like a you know, Counting Crow's T shirt, that doesn't cut it, buddy, Although the Crows, Counting Ravens maybe Baltimore maybe maybe. Uh So. One of these notes though that supposedly was left by one of the sons, if you buy that theory, was a prediction of the Super Bowl in two thousand one, that the giants would beat the ravens. So if if it was his sons, then I totally see how Jeff to Rome would be like, they're not doing a great job exactly. So. Um. So finally, in two thousand nine, I guess that's twenty years. Ten years, yes, ten um, ten years after the torch was passed, After the original Poe Toaster died allegedly, Um, they just stopped showing up all together. And they didn't show up in two thousand and ten eleven, and then finally in two thousand twelve, when they didn't show one more time. Um, Jeff Jerome said, well, I guess I have as much cloud as anybody. Being the curator of the Poem Museum, I'm gonna officially declare this tradition ended forever. Yeah, but not so, because he turned on his heels four years later and in said, you know what, let's just throw a big party. Uh, we're gonna audition Poe Toasters. And this is where the story really like. It's disappointing to me. I wish they would have just let it die. It's this mysterious weird thing, is it the raffle. Yeah, they have a raffle. They have a po themed cake that you can win, um, you know, hundreds of people. They toast apple cider, and I don't mind them honoring Poe, but it just I think they could have just divided it and not made it part of the Poe toasting thing that came and went yeah, yeah, I have to I have to agree. I like that it's a I like the idea of what they're doing. I like the toast with apple cider like, but I think, yeah, maybe hold it at the local library or something, because it really smacks of like the kind of event you would hold at a local library. Yeah, and it's during the daytime. I don't think we mentioned which I mean, if it's not between midnight and six am, then just get out of here with that. True, But it does give the Poe Toaster an excuse to do some day drinking of cognac once a year at least or apple cider. Yeah, supposedly the po Toaster does does drink yex still a tradition. Yeah, so I don't. Did you say that they held auditions for the new pot toaster. I did, And the new pot Toaster plays the violin, though added a little extra flare. Yeah, maybe you know what's gonna happen is they're going to hear about this and then make us honorary po toasters, and we're gonna be way into it. Yeah right exactly. I'm gonna wear a Counting Crow's T shirt and I learned to play the violin, all right, So that's it, everybody the pot toaster. This is one of those legends where I hope we never ever find out who it was, because I think that's wildly appropriate in this case. Okay, ad executive, Well, since Chuck said ad executive, that's the secret word for short stuff to be out.
