Josh: Welcome to stuff you should know from how Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry over there, and this is who I object to what I don't know. I don't think you object them from the Supreme Court. I think they strike you down with lightning if you talk out of turn. Yeah did they even uh geez, I'd love to see one of those hearings. Yeah, they even call them hearings. Uh, magic our right, I don't know. I'm sure they do call them hearings. I'm almost positive it's like shrouded in secrecy though, right, you never know. I don't show that stuff on TV, do they like? No, but they do have like like if you listen to Nina Totenberg, she's a great Supreme Court reporter, and um, it's all. It's not televised and I guess it is just traditional reporting reporters that are allowed in there. But it's not closed to the press or and he's not like a Pasi court or it's not it's not the Star Chamber. No, no, uh, it's interesting though, it's it is sort of it does seem sort of secretive though, because they like write these rulings. Sometimes they don't even read them. I saw that Clarence Thomas went seven years without speaking in court. What Yeah, that's what it said. Where did you see that? In an article about Clarence Thomas. It said he he's one of the quietest justices. That said he went at one point seven years without speaking in court. But apparently writes a lot in his uh um rulings and you know, his briefs, his briefs, he writes in his briefs. Yeah, I can see that because I guess when you're in court, you're arguing in front of the Supreme Court, I think basically, and we'll do like a whole separate Supreme Court episode. Yeah right, agreed, Sure, okay, um, somebody mark that town. But you are, you're being peppered with questions from them and then like you're you're trying to answer the questions to to show why your side is right right and arguing the case right now here and intimidates you. Um. But yeah, part of it is going back thinking about it and then writing your opinion on It's very weird job. It is. It's a pretty neat job. Too. One of the big things about it is it's in here in the United States. If you are on the Supreme Court's the highest court in the land, you're there for life. It's a it's a life appointment. Is the only as far as I know, besides you know, um working at the d M v AM. I right, it's the only for life appointment in the United States government. Yeah, which seems like kind of crazy, but it also sort of makes sense because you want you want a stable Supreme Court. Yeah, you want them focusing on cases, not you know, what's going on, whether they need to elected again or campaign. That makes it makes sense once you kind of put your head to it. Plus, it also kind of dovetails with the way that they're viewed here in this country and I'm sure abroad to um that they are this panel of highly learned legal scholars just basically like um uh, I don't know. I'm sure there's something in Star Wars that resembles this. You know, the Jedi Council. Oh man, I'm always afraid to say, hang about Star Wars. You know, the Jedi Council that John jar Binks was on. Okay, Yeah, we won't hear anything about that. How could we write? Uh so this was written by our old buddy Ed Grabbynowski. Yes, should we tell everybody? Should we reveal the big reveal? Do we have an announcement? I think so? All right, go ahead. Oh you're letting me do it so everybody. You may not know that because we tried to stretch out Grabstar articles as much as we could, but they were starting to get thin. Ye, Crabster wasn't really writing for the site any longer. While we said enough of this, we need them, you need them bad. So we did a little wheeling tad bitter dealing and Grabster is going to be writing again, specifically topics that we are requesting. Yeah, it's pretty great. Like you and I were both so excited, stoked, I think is the word. Yeah. So anyway, we love Ed and uh big shout out to him and to Buffalo New York and their wings and their football team. Sure why not? So anyway Ed wrote this, Um, and you know, it's a great article. So, like you said, I think we kind of duve into it really quickly. But um, if you're not in the United States, you might be saying, what's the Supreme Court? Although I think you probably know. Um, like you said, they are the highest court and um, they're the third branch of our government. Uh. And they are specifically specifically air to kind of keep everyone in check and to say, like, you know, you may be the president, but you're not a dictator because you still have to answer to the Supreme Court at the end of the day. You can't run a monk. And we're gonna we're gonna make sure that we and this is ideally, we're going to make sure that we review everything in a in a legal way, and we're gonna get to ideology. You can't escape that, of course, but you know, Supreme Court justices are supposed to rule on law and specifically these days at least how it relates to the Constitution. Yeah, and that's a It wasn't their initial They weren't created to say, like, go defend the Constitution. Uh. And the the Supreme Court said, well, can we sow some patches or bedazzle our robes? And the framers said sure, we don't care, so they went out and defended the constitution. It actually is very vague. The judicial branch or the Supreme Court is created in the Constitution, but all it says is that they are there to UM. They that it's power should shall quote extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution. That's it. It's the only thing it mentions about the Supreme Court and its power. So Ever since the Constitution was written and ratified, the Supreme Court has kind of been this evolving thing, or it was evolving for a while. Now it's pretty well set into into its role and what it's meant to do. What evolves and changes are, like you said, the ideology and the personality of the of the people sitting on the court. Yeah, and their word is the final word. Um. There there is no court that can overturn or review even their decisions. And they review. They have about five thousand cases submitted every year and can only review about a hundred to a hundred and fifty, which I thought was kind of a lot. Actually, yeah, I was not expecting that. UM. And they specifically try now, like we said, and focus on the constitution or UM usually cases that have been appealed from lower federal courts. You know, they worked their way up to food chain um or and I think they probably love these uh treason cases involving treason or disputes with other countries or ambassadors kind of like you know, the high stakes stuff. Imagine being an ambassador and getting dragged in front of the Supreme Court for something you did being or your kid did. Yeah, probably a little snot nosed brats ambassador kids. So like, like I was saying, the the Constitution is pretty vague about what the Supreme Court is meant to do. And it wasn't even out of the gate that they realized that they were supposed to really kind of examine laws in respect to the Constitution. That started in an eighteen oh three case Marbury versus Madison, and it was yeah, it was a landmark watershed case both both kinds um and ironically, the court found owned that it didn't have the power to satisfy the petitions of the petitioners. I think James Madison or no, Stephan Marberry was suing James Madison because James Madison had said, um, we'll give you these commissions and then he was taken out of office or he phased out of office and the commissions were forfeited, and the Supreme Court said, you know, we thought we had the power to do this, but it turns out we don't constitutionally, so sorry. And it was the first time that the Supreme Court had ever examined something through the lens of the Constitution, and that set the precedent from then on. Yeah. And they serve, well, they serve kind of however long they want to or if they die obviously, but the average about fourteen years UM or if they retire, they average retirement age seventy one UM. But they can serve super long. And I know that one justice served for thirty five years UM. And you know, if you if you nominate a young judge, which is kind of more of the trend these days when you're thinking politically, like you know, we want someone in there for our team, so pick a young one, right, Uh. Then they can have tremendous sway And how things going this guy year after year after year after year. Yeah. Yeah, because the reason why they have so much sway is like the stuff that they're they're ruling on is constitutional in nature, and here in the United States, if it's if it's constitutional, if it's guaranteed by the Constitution, protected by the constitution, outlawed by the Constitution, whatever. However, the Supreme Court measures the law against the constitution, Like you said, that's the law of the land. From that point on. Um, any law similar to uh, what the Supreme Court just ruled on, it's immediately null and void, like it's done. Um ed used is a really good an example. And this he said, like if if main bands anti war signs from people's front yards and Supreme Court rules that that law is unconstitutional, well, if Rhode Island has a similar law, California is a similar law, those those laws are immediately illegal. I guess, um. And it's not like Rhode Island's gonna bring their case and then California is going to try their case. Once they rule, it's done. It's been ruled on. That's right by the sc Yeah, and uh, there are nine justices, Um right now there are eight, which we're going to get into. And uh, obviously having an odd number means you can break a tie. So it's um with eight you can have a tie. And when you do have a tie, they've actually thought about this, believe it or not, they arm wrestle. I'm kidding, of course, they don't arm wrestle. But um, what happens is the lower court decision is what's called passively upheld, which means that for that case only, it's upheld. But it's not like the Supreme Court didn't rule on it, and it doesn't create that that nationwide legal precedent forever and ever passive aggressive and someone could you know, once I get that ninth person, they could bring up a similar case, not the same one, but a similar one if they want to like have that precedent said in the Supreme Courek will be like, let's try it again. Yeah, but yeah, if you for a case to be decided definitively, all you need is a simple majority five to four. And a lot of cases these days in the United States are have I have like five to four decisions, um, Which is the fact that that's a pattern and then that's routine really kind of shows you how just close to the center that that ideologically the bench is. And um that all it would take was you know, one or two votes that you can really rely on one way or the other. It's going to be super liberal or it'll be super conservative. Yeah, and these days it's um, I mean sometimes you'll get surprises on ideology, like oh, we thought this person would vote this way, that way, But generally you got kind of the four on the left the four on the right, or you know you did before Scalia died. And um, I think Kennedy is sort of the swing vote, right, yeah, generally speaking for us right, it used to be Sandra Day O'Connor. Right. But when when they say, oh, we were surprised, we thought they were going to vote this way, that's putting it about as mildly as you can. But surprise, yeah, outrage. I wasn't expected that fiddle d d yeah, And I looked up some of the I mean, we'll get to this later, but some of the appointees, um, throughout history have been made by like conservative points of conservative and then they might grow a little more liberal over time or the other way around. And they're always like they're so upset, like, you know, I thought this is what we were getting. But to me, that's how it should be, you know, Like that means probably that that judges deciding cases based on merit and not like I'm just dug in and entrenched in one ideology. Yes, which is exactly what you want from a Supreme Court justice. Should we take a break, Yeah, let's take a break. All right, we're talking about appointments, so we'll get to that right after this. All right, how's this work appointing? Yeah, so remember the constitutions when their Supreme Court do it. I'm done. I'm out right and going to take a nap um. So appoint appointments, it's it's all just made up. There's no qualifications. Uh, there's no requirements. You you or I could be nominated to be on the Supreme Court. The President was like, I want to figure out the fastest way to ruin my political career. I've got it. That's that'd be a good way to do it. Because again, here in this country, people treat Supreme Court nominations like a religion. It's a big, big deal. Not even to like get someone through the process. Just to nominate somebody can bring so much blowback from your party, from the voters, from the opposing party, from everybody that you really want to think it through. It's not a haphazard thing. But as as far as the starting the whole thing off, you have a list of qualified candidates. I think every single Supreme Court justice in history has been a lawyer at least, but lately almost all of them The only person on the Supreme Court now who isn't a judge is Elena Kagan Um. But the trend is is most of them are federal judges who are called up to the bigs. Yeah. And a lot of them have even served as clerks on the Supreme Court. Um. So what they're looking for with all that is experience. Yeah. And and for the last hundred and fifty years, not only have they been attorneys, but they've they didn't go to you know, the strip mall although was it O'Connor, Well, she didn't go to a strip mall law school, but she was a strip mall lawyer. I think yeah at first. But they have all graduated from like an accredited legit university, like not like Dr Nick graduated from the Upstairs Medical Clinic. Is that what it was called. I think it was Tijuana Upstairs Medical Credit. Uh. A lot of these UM justices before their Supreme Court appointment have been involved in politics. Um. Some of them have been governors, some of them have been in Congress. There was even one former president, one Howard Taft. Howard is actually a great story. He hated being president, hated it, loved being a Supreme Court Justice. I could see that, he said. On the bench, it groaned, anyway, I'm home, this is great, the bench groaned. I know that for a little while there were people there were there were rumblings that Obama might be in line for a Supreme Court appointment had the election gone a Diffroy, which would have been I could see that. I could too, But um, you know, obviously that's not gonna happen. No, I don't see Trump, I pointing Obama. All right, So, once this nomination goes through UM and you know, the president, it used to be like a very I don't know about solitary probably there a little close circle. But now, like you said, they get a list and that that's culled from a group of very smart people that are UM trying to firmly entrench their own ideologies basically, so they're gonna choose from that list the candidate UM and nominate them officially in the Senate. Then we'll hold hearings. And just recently, you know, we've seen this going on. You know, this is happening right now with Gorse. Yeah, and the whole thing would have started with Gorsets getting a phone call from the press saying, hey, I want you to want me on the Supreme Court, and Gorstch was like, I don't, I don't know what you're saying. He's like, you're gonna be on the Supreme Court and hung up right. That was it, And then uh yeah, the name gets released to the press and the Senate says, all right, let's get busy, let's get to work, and um, this whole high bee hive of activity just starts kicking up around this one. Poor sap who accepted the nomination and now has everyone from the Justice Department to Congressional aids putting on latex gloves and going right up there rectum to try to see what they can find in this person since passed. Yeah, and not only what they can find in their past, but really grilling them, um on maybe where he or she might lie ideologically, like how how would you rule in this case that it has happened? How did you feel about this case? And I was watching um A news network the other day talking about how Gorsets did such a masterful job of like dodging, yeah about like not going on record with with how they lean, um and that's tradition. Well, yeah, apparently they they like the one thing that you're supposed to do up there is not give anything away. No, because it's just a big dance. And if they say yeah, Joe Biden back and I think the eighties called it a kabuki dance. Um, and Elena Kagan called it a vapid and hollow charade because the senators are trying to pin you down one way or another on your views on gun control, abortion, all of these hot button issues that the Supreme Court has either ruled on, may rule on in the future, may overturn at some point. Um. That that really split the country ideologically. And the point of these Senate hearings is basically for the nominee to sit there and not give up anything, because if they did do that, then they would have to recuse themselves from that case for having gone on the public record stating their position. Well yeah, And it's the opposition's party's job to sit there and sigh and rub their temples and say, well, it just seems like you don't want to go on record for anything, right, And they never get to respond. Duh. It's a Senate hearing for Supreme Court justice is what always happened. It's really funny that they play that up, that like the senators act like they just can't believe what's going on even though this has been happening for decades now. Yeah, it's just a big I don't know about a charade, but I think part of it is they part of it is to see how well they can hold up to the grilling too. I think that's part of it as well. But the group that probably plays the biggest role in in in kind of rooting out what the nominees politics are are the aids in the Justice Department and whatever they leak to the media, because, um, you're not gonna you wouldn't find anything out about say, like Gorsets from those two days of hearings. No one found anything out about him. If that's all you know about that guy was those two days of hearings, you didn't read anything else about it, You have no idea what his positions where. You'd just be like, that guy's got one of the better haircuts I've ever seen in my life. That's all you would get from it. But the media tends to report on it and they kind of fulfill the role that um that that the Senate fails at every single time and it'll be things like, um, Harriet Myers was was, um was nominated by George W. Bush, and Um, he just got immediate blowback for it is a terrible nomination. But one of the things somebody found was that she had cant if you did some money back in like a good fifteen something years before to Al Gore's presidential campaign. Like they find like little stuff like that, and they try to put it all together to create a picture so that the Senators can ask them about stuff or whatever, or the media can can paint a picture one way or another, and everyone can try to divine how they're going to rule. Now, did Harriet Myers actually go through the Senate hearings? Well, that that's what will happen a lot of times if there is a skeleton in their closet. Sometimes they want to accept the nomination, not even for that reason. Sometimes they want to accept the nomination because they're like, no, man, I know it, I don't want to go through all that. I'm fine just being on my federal circuit here. Um. But sometimes they'll withdraw if they know that they won't make it through that and they don't want that drug out in public. And sometimes the the President will withdraw that nomination to avoid that kind of embarrassment too, right, Um, Like Clarence Thomas, I don't know how they missed that, or if they did, you know, he would famously was uh allegedly sexually harassed Anita Hill. And I don't know if they that didn't come to light until the hearings or if that's what my guess was. I think they started the hearings and they were still doing investigations and they got into Anita Hill. Yet he would come I don't think in today's climate, no, that was that was nuts, um. But the what's ironic about it is that he wouldn't make it in today's climate with our awareness and understanding of sexual harassment. But those hearings, his his Supreme Court Um confirmation hearings were what exposed the world to sexual harassment and concept of it that we understand today is rooted in that moment in those three days where Anita Hill stood up and was like, this is messed up and I'm gonna share it. Um. And and Clarence Thomas famously called the whole thing a high tech lynching. And then after all this, so he was about to be voted on. There was debate in the Senate, which we'll get to this process in a second. They sent after this came to light, they sent it back to the committee hearings. So he took a huge step backward in the confirmation process, had to go through three days of Anita Hills testimony, and then after that the Senate still said, all right, cool, well we'll confirm you. Yeah, and he was so upset he said, you know, I'm not gonna talk for seven years, right, I'll show you so. UM. By and large, though the vast majority of appointee UM submissions what would you call him nominations are appointed, right. Oh, I think it's something like there have been a hundred and sixty one nominations and a hundred and twenty four have been confirmed. I think there's only been thirty six rejections, and so the rest are withdraws, withdrawals UM or. There's one very recent one that I think is the first in history, um Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland. They just didn't even get hurt. Yeah, um, which is very much an unusual, uh step that was taken in the process. Yeah, I mean, this just happened. Everyone saw it happen. Um. Obama was in his last year of his presidency, and so uh, Republican senators basically said, not only are we not gonna vote on it, we're not gonna hold hearings. Some of them refused to even talk to the guy. They just basically took their ball and went home. Right, so we're not gonna do anything, which received a lot of blowback from people already frustrated with the um the notion that maybe these people work for them and they should do their jobs, and that is one of their jobs is to at least have hearings and take a vote, and um they everyone dug in and um he went without earrings, went without a vote, And uh, I don't know what he's doing now. I guess he just kept his regular job. Oh yeah, I'm sure. I don't think you like lose your job and no, no, like quit and move and everything go on the trail. Um no he uh yeah, I I but I think the more to the point, like you're it's gotta affect your reputation, you know what I'm saying, Like even if it had it was no fault of his own, it's still like a black mark on his history at least. Well, it was a big deal because this was Um, it's kind of tough to pin down someone's political ideology as a judge. They have a few ways of doing it. There's something called the Martin Quinn score for Supreme Court justices, and they compare how they vote relative to one another. Uh. And then there's something else called the Judicial common Space score, which measures their ideology based on the ideology of their appointing presidents and home state senators. And then I think this from Washington Posts, I read an article that they're basically trying to sus out how liberal is Garland right here? Who was super centrist, wasn't he? Well, they said in the end that they looked at all those scores, and then they did one more where they basically looked at the law clerks that they hired, because generally you're gonna hire clerks that agree with you, and clerks to work for judges who they who they agree with, um, And they looked at what they're the clerks political donations where they were So what's this? They said that he was center left in the end, would have definitely swung the court more to the left. But at the time you know, it was sort of a showdown. It was like for the Republicans are like, do we do we let Garland go through because he's sort of center left? Where do we take a chance that Hillary wins this election and goes whole hog left to someone that's way more liberal. And in the end they dug in and uh, well everyone knows what happened. Uh yeah, And I read both sides of this, likebviously the liberals and the Democrats were just going crazy over it there like this with the audacity of not doing this right, um that that because the Republicans were saying, well, it's an election year, so we don't want to put a Supreme Court nominee on the Supreme Court for life during an election year, right, And the Democrats said, you're crazy. There's been like eight or nine Supreme Court justices who were confirmed on an election year. That's a terrible argument. But apparently that was when the um the I think the government wasn't split, right, There wasn't like the executive and Congress were in the same party. The same party was in power for like seven or eight of those confirmations to have gone through, So both sides actually had legitimate arguments, but it definitely seemed like a dereliction of duty from the outside looking in. Well, what it did, too, was it set up, um the gorste situation now, which is Democrats are delaying the vote, and I think by the time this comes out, they will have voted. I would guess so, because usually I think McConnell said by April two he'd be confirmed, was his estimate. Yeah, well they delayed it one more week a couple of days ago, but um, regardless, it's it's you know, imminent if it hasn't just happened. And so they set up the situation now where Democrats are dug in and they're like, don't expect any votes from us to confirm. And then the Republicans are saying, well, if you do that, though, we don't need a simple we just need a simple majority. We can use what's called the nuclear option, which we talked about in the Filibusters episode. I think, yeah, so they're the Democrats would filibuster, then they would use a nuclear option, which means they can kind of rewrite the rules and confirm with a simple majority. And then there's a fear that if that happens, that will just be the norm going forward. Yeah, that they'll use that for everything. And and on the one hand, it will definitely be the Democrats fault because they used the nuclear option first. But they used it for a bunch of Obama appointees back and I think two thousand thirteen or fifteen, and um, they said specifically this does not apply to Supreme Court nominees. Now the pendulum is swing the other way. The Republicans are in control. If they use the nuclear option for the Supreme Court nominees, that'll that'll just be like there will be nothing off limits any longer. And yeah, they'll there will be no filibuster power in the Senate any longer. Yeah. It really underscores just how ugly things have gotten, you know. Yeah, it's pretty ugly these days in Washington. Uh And and we should say, well, we'll take a break in a second, choke, but we keep talking about the Senate. The House has nothing to do with this, actually, yeah a little bit. Um, it's strictly the president appoints, and the Senate holds committee hearings and then debate and then votes, and then the person is either confirmed or rejected, almost exclusively confirmed. And if they are rejected. Um, they can't be submitted again. But it usually doesn't make sense too unless something big has happened that makes the president think that they can get confirmed. Which happened I think with Andrew Jackson. Is that right? Yeah? In the eighteen six Yeah, he had a guy named Roger Taney who had never heard of before. Um, who he submitted. Guy got rejected, and then there were elections that changed the complexion of the Senate. Yeah, that was much friendlier to Jackson. So he did it again. I got he brought him in with a like a baseball head on. Yeah, I said, how about this guy big mustache? Um? And George W. Bush did the same thing too, but he his guy John Roberts didn't get rejected, but he nominated Roberts twice in the same month for two different seats. The second time he got confirmed. So well, well, um, there's a lot of politicking that goes on behind this, A lot of thought goes into it, not surprisingly, and we'll talk about all that stuff right after this. So chuck, um, this is not again, This isn't taken lightly. Um. It is a hollow and vapid sharade and a kabuki dance and it's ridiculous in a lot of ways, but it's the end result is really really important, and that is that you have a Supreme Court justice who's one of nine voices that are that create the law of the land here in the United States, and that they're on there for life. So everyone again takes it extremely seriously, and there's a lot of things to be considered when a president is even picking a nominee from that list that they have. Yeah, that you know, even though we said there are no rules for qualifications, there is a long history that's kind of become accepted as qualifications, which we've talked about an attorney generally a federal court judge. Um, so once that is kind of sussed out. We talked about ideology a lot, and um, you're not gonna find his head points out the perfect fit where someone agrees with everything that you agree with as president, But what you want is someone who by and large will side with your side. What Yeah, you know, he's like us, But again it's not going to be a perfect fit. Yeah. Like, but you also want someone who probably has a good chance of getting uh confirmed. That's a big that's a big point, right, So like that. There's a lot of factors that go into that selection. Right. So obviously, if you are a conservative president, especially like a deeply socially conservative president, you're gonna try to find somebody who's a pretty socially conservative ideologue, right, and that will be your your pick. But you may want to stop yourself and think about this first. Let's let's let's think about this. Who's in control of the Senate. That's a big one. If it's the opposition party, well, then you may want to consider somebody who's um maybe a little closer to the center, because your person might get rejected. And if you're just an outside observer saying, well, who cares, it's they'll they'll get rejected. Pick somebody else. You you said you have a list, go to the next person, right. There's a lot of political ramifications for this, right. So if if you are a president and you're picking a pretty radical nominee, um, it can make you look bad, especially if you're not that popular of a president. Yeah, And it can also have a lot of bearing on mid term elections and how the public views the direction the country is going as a whole. Yeah, Because if the Senate goes along with your radical person and the public is not down with that person. That's going to be a a negation on on on the ballot, like you're you're You're not going to look good at all because of this Supreme Court nominee pick. Yeah, the the whoever um just left whatever, whether it was a retiree or in the case of Scalia, someone who just died. Um suddenly, Um, the outgoing justice is gonna play a large part in and again depending on what parties in office, what party holds the Senate, because gets the replacement, can you can you get somebody pushed through? And if you can't, it's not gonna look very good on you as the president. Yeah. And basically with gorsech Um, I looked him up as far as where he might sit or is predicted to sit. He's pretty right. Yeah, obviously he's pretty right. But they said that he was right now at least you know this is from all the studying done from those different methodologies that I talked about earlier. They said he would sit second to the right, next to Thomas, the silent Clarence Thomas apparently is the furthest right at this point. Um. And then you know, it goes all the way through down to uh Sonia Soda Mayor, who's uh the furthest to the left, and then uh Mr Kennedy in the middle man. What a powerful dude he is. He gets gift baskets all the time. Yeah, yeah, he has muffins every morning. And you know, depending on and people forecast this like a way in advance. I'm like, it's not just Supreme Court justices, it's appointing appointing judges all throughout the system in the United States. Um, Republicans have had a tactic for years now that's really paid off for them where they have really worked hard to appoint as many judges conservative leaning judges throughout the system and staunchly tried to oppose any liberal appointments. And um, you get those lower courts. I mean, people don't pay a lot of attention a lot of times to these lower court appointments, and it's made a big difference, you know, Oh yeah over time. Sure, if you've got that many more bullets in the chamber just in as far as like conservative rulings, yeah, just all over the country. You know, if you have more of your people in place, and lower courts they're going to be more clerks that work for them that are conservative, and then eventually they rise up and you're probably gonna have a better chance of getting a Supreme Court nominee appointed who was conservative. It's an incubator. Yeah, that's a good way to look at it. A farm system. Sure, they probably love that terminology. But you were saying, so do Myers farthest to the left and Thomas is farthest to the right, right, Now, that's what they say. Yeah, and I think you're saying earlier to that. You know, depending on who's being replaced, and that makes a decision on who's picked as well. True, right, because if you're replacing a far right seat with a far left nominee, you're gonna get some serious um push back from the right or vice versa. Yeah, And that's why this election, you know, that we just went through, was so important because there are some aging members of the Supreme Court, and um, you know, if you get to a point like Nixon got to a point, four Supreme Court justices, Yeah, and they turned on him like a pack of jackals, three of them did. I'm sure that's that's what Nixon thought. Um, yeah, that's that's and this is kind of a pretty good demonstration of how Supreme Court nominees. They're appointed or they're nominated by presidents, but they are in no way meant to be beholden to presidents. They should not be. It's it's they're not doing their job if they're ruling in in line with what they think the president wants to hear. Yeah, and I guess that goes back to why they're in there for life. Like they probably do feel I mean, they still have their ideologies, but they probably do feel like, all right, I'm in here. They can't take me out. Um, there's probably some mechanism to take them out. There is something really bad. It's a it's impeachment. It's the exact same process that you would get rid of a president with where the House impeaches the person and then the Senate votes to convict or not and then they're removed. It's only been threatened twice. One of them was a Nixon appointing, and thing. Uh, but I was looking, like I said, at Garland and the kind of gut started digging into history and um in the modern era, and uh, Anton and Scalia is rated as the number one most conservative justice in the modern era. Is that right? That's what it said. See because I have anonymous further right than him, and that gorstch would be even further right than Scalia. I didn't create that. That's a well, I didn't create this either. So well, this was Stanford University, in the University of Chicago, Northwestern and Harvard. Yeah, but it was based on um. It just depends on what they use. Let's just say they're both super conservative. But I mean one of the things they looked at and they like to look at his campaign contributions, either by like I said, clerks or by them, and they said, based on Gorstages Gorstages campaign contry utians, they said that he would be more conservative than seven percent of all other federal judges. That's pretty conservative. When Requests was supposedly number two and they don't have Thomas where they have they have Thomas at number seven on my list. I don't know by that. They have him on the furthest right right now, at least in the sitting justices. Well, and then there's people, like I said, over time that might change a bit. John Paul Stevens was the guy that was in there for thirty five years and apparently he became more liberal over time. Um, and then Burton was very conservative, but he ruled against segregation. It's like you kind of never know. Uh. David Souder became he was a Bush appointee, and I think he was one of those that like conservatives were really mad at. They were like, you're not nearly as conservative as we thought, Souder. They would have never picked you. Yeah, And I mean you just can never tell. You can't tell. And the whole point is that makes a good just this, that's what you want. You don't want to be able to look at them and be like, oh, this is how they're going to vote and be right every time. You want to be surprised, because if you can just point to a Supreme Court justice and say this is how they're gonna vote, they're doing a terrible job. They're voting ideologically, not on the merits of the case. Yeah, it sounds funny to say that you want a Supreme Court justice like you never know what they're gonna do. And I'm predictable like Clarence Thomas, he didn't speak for seven years. Who knew. I did not see that coming A Penny farthing to work every day. He didn't know that Judge Rehnquist had a huge heroin problem. Oh you got anything else? Uh? Yeah. One of the things that Harriet Myers was criticized for the Harriet Myers nomination by George W. Bush was that somebody had dug up that she had called George W. Bush cool at one point, and that was used against here. Huh. Well, they were worried that she was she would be beholden to him because he was so cool cool. Interesting. Um, Actually we didn't cover this. I think it's pretty interesting. Um. Arthur Goldberg appointment of John F. Kennedy. He was Jewish, and he took his oath on the Hebrew Bible and on the traditional Official Court Bible, which is a Christian Bible, and he signed that because everyone has signed it. And he said, you know, I just want to I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this, even though I'm Jewish. I'll sign the Christian Bible just to kind of maintain that continuity. But when he was um, he said it was really neat. When he was sitting at his bench for the first time, he uh, he opened up the drawer and there was a copy of the Constitution, because he said it was a dog gear to copy of the Constitution that actually belonged and it was signed by who Oliver Wendell Holmes. Pretty neat was just in that drawer. He calls him that old yankee from a limp. This no idea what that means, but it meant something to Goldberg. I'll tell you that. He said he's looking for like a notepad. Yeah, and there was. He thought that was pretty awesome. Well, it is pretty awesome. And if you think Supreme Court nominations are awesome, you should go look them up. There's plenty of stuff out there. It's pretty fun to watch. Uh, if you go back through old articles, every nomination cycle or whatever pattern it follows um has people griping about how you can't tell anything about this nominee and they never say, well, it's like that for all nominees. Anyway, take a trip down memory lane. You'll amuse yourself. You can also type in the words Freme Court in the search bar. How stuff works. And since I said Supreme Court, it's time for listening. Now I'm gonna call this Georgia connection to Trail of Tears. Hey, guys. I enjoyed the episodes on Trail of Tears, which I literally just finished. Even Calhoun, Georgia, which is home to the new ektoa She says yeah, she says, oh, even it's He's serious, sir, And I think that's right historic site. It is home to the print shop where the first English language Cherokee newspaper was printed, the home of Samuel wools Stuff, among other things. It's a beautiful and fascinating place. I think all uh North Georgia kids have gone on a field trip there at least once. There are also road signs that drive past every time I drive to and from my mother's house, indicating that I am actually driving where the Cherokee marched from their homes, very sobering. The home of Chief Van is also nearby. I didn't know that I'm gonna have to go see that stuff. Yeah, because it's not too far. I enjoy your history episodes because the way you explain history in layman's terms and make it interesting to someone like me who couldn't quite stay awake in history class in school. I believe learning about history is important to help prevent society from repeating big, shameful Calcy Mistakes. Thanks for the work you do and all the stuff we should know. Have a blessed day.
