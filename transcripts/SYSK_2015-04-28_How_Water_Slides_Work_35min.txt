Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you should know Frondhouse stuff works dot Com. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry slowing us down. And this is stuff you should know the podcast. That's right. The water slide addition. Yeah, man, you like water slides. Who doesn't? Nobody? Pretty much? Water slides are point man. I used to go to uh Whitewater here in Atlanta growing up. I haven't been in years and years to a water park. Yeah. I would like to go, though, Oh you're gonna go again. Yeah. I mean I don't know the Whitewater because I don't know if it's any good. I mean, it was great when I was a kid, but now that I'm adults, I'm a little more discerning with my needs. I see, you know, reading about some of these water parks, I'm like, they're really doing it right. Yeah, like the one in Kansas City. Yeah, what's it called the well? I think it's a German name, isn't it. Yeah, um schlitterband. And you know why it's German? Why because German invented the water sign. Okay, I was looking this up. I was looking all over for the first water slide. Um, I think I found it. I want to hear all right, And it was fairly recent too, Like I thought water slides probably the four hundreds. Yeah, this is what I would have guessed. Nope, I was way off. Well, this one article I found says that the very first time people did this was people aqueduct workers in Rome and Egypt. They would, you know, to get from one point to another, quicker would just slide down the aqueduct. Very smart. So they think that's where the idea may have come from. But well, there's also plenty. There's a lot of natural water slides around the world to um that people take advare. So I would imagine it started out like even maybe before then. Yeah, where someone finally said though, hey, this is nido, I can make money off of it, and let's build one just for this purpose. And what I found was nineteen three with Herbert selna Um, who was actually an American. I thought he was German. Um. Uh, well, this was in Minnesota. You invented the water toboggan slide and they got to use it two days out of the year. Um. And I think it was more it was a sled type deal. And then I saw one in England or in the nineteen thirties or so, where it was the same deal. It was like a little flat bottomed boat that you know, you in England they still had on their full they weren't even like in bading gear. They're like in there, they're full suits and monocles and frocks sitting in this boat. So it's basically a little flat bottom boat that would go down to slide and then skitter across the water like the log ride or something like that. Yeah, that's that's the water slide, except way more dangerous, I would guess, because it's the uh yeah, exactly. So I thought the providence was even more recent than that. I thought it was the nineteen seventies. Well that's where the water park was born. Okay. I ran across mentions of water slides, original water slides in the United States from like the seventies the earliest I found. Well, you'll find the Minnesota one. You didn't find the Minnesota Well here's did you read that story? The history of water parks? Yeah? Man, you came up with this great article from grant Land, which is a publication that has some really good long form articles, but this one in particular was really cool. Uh. And it is what is it called? Do you remember the wet stuff that we have a play on the right stuff? Yeah, like the original astronauts of water parks. Well, in this case, um George Malay in nineteen seventy four was sort of the inventor and main thief that built the water park by stealing a bunch and this out. Now there were water slide because he would travel all over the country and they'll be like, oh, there's this concrete water slide, but that was all it was at the time. It was like this hill with like three curvy concrete slides cut into the side of it. Yeah, and you heard chuck right, he just said concrete. The original man made water slides were made of concrete. Yes, I've been on those. Did it not like tear your skin up? No, it was really Yeah, it's like a concrete swimming pool. Um, yeah, which I mean like if you ever come in contact with the bottom of it, it hurts. Well. No, there's a lot of water first of all, and then these are the ones you needed the little mat to sit on. Okay, that makes sense. It's gonna stay like you just stand up in the bottom of your swimming trus to be totally shredded. So Malay had the original idea when he went to a wave pool um in Alabama and said this is awesome. He would see a water slide and say that is awesome. He would see like a little kid's water thing, say that is awesome. Him, let's bring it all together. Let's bring it all together. And then he was the guy who made Wet and Wild. Yeah. Well he was originally of the creator sea World and then left the Sea World in nineteen seventy four. Who's fourced out? Yeah. I get the feeling that he was not an easy guy to work with. No Supposedly in this Grantland article, supposedly his he had red hair and his face would get just as red when he'd start yelling, which was a lot. Yeah. So he said, let's bring this all together. Um, let's go um Inland to where people don't have access to beaches and things, which makes sense human maide beaches. Yeah, with these wave pools and uh. He was rebuffed by investors at first because they were like, no one's gonna pay the swim you big dummy. Yeah, that's really stupid idea. Yeah, that was like the initial response that he got. Yeah, and like I can kind of understand that no one had ever tried it before. Swimming and bathing was one of those things that like you just went to the beach and it was free. Yeah, So the idea of bringing the beach to people was kind of lost on on the early investors, not all of them. He managed to raise like three million bucks. Yeah, or they'd be like community pools and things, but not like a theme park, just without without roller coasters and rides. People thought he was nuts, so he built it anyway. In Orlando. He called it Wet and Wild um, because he said, apparently in a meeting, I want it, it's gotta be the name's gotta be wet and wild, and they're like, how about that. We're ready to go home pretty much even yelling at us all day. Um. The center piece of Wet and Wild was the wave pool. Yeah, which you know it's like that that well, it's a wave pool. It's a pool that creates waves, which was a huge deal. And that's the one that's what he saw Indicatur Alabama vour right, that's the thing that kicked it all off, and like you said, it was the centerpiece. So when you came into Wet and Wild in Orlando on International Drive, um, that was the first thing you saw, and it was meant to kind of bull you over a little bit, like, oh my gosh, it's a it's a human made beach. Trying to discontinue my use of man made by the way. Oh really, Yeah, sure, it's really easy to say too, because you grow you grow up saying that, but yeah, human made it's harder to say. It's harder to remember. So I'm training myself. Good job. I'm gonna start that too now. But you're gonna say human made, right, maybe you and Terry Gross So uh, the the idea was pretty great, but it didn't take off at first. Um he lost about four grand in his first year because people were used to roller coaster parks and they were used to go go, go, go go at those things. He was trying to talk parents into kicking back on the lounge chair by the wave pool while the kids partied, and the parents were like yeah. The parents who went though were like this is kind of awesome, actually yeah, But getting them there at first was a lot harder than he anticipated. Yeah. Um. He figured out though that there was kind of a too to a dual attractiveness to um a water park depending on your age. So like, if you're a teenager, you wanted something fast and scary and fun and sure, sure, but you wanted something that you wanted thrills and spills and chills. Right, if you're a parent, by the time you're at this place, it's probably very hot. You've probably already been to Disney World or whatever, and you are tired, worn out, but your kids still has tons of energy, so they're running around. You don't feel like running around. You feel like sitting in a way pool, You feel like sitting on a lounge chair, or you feel like and this is an idea he ripped off from I think um Sri Lanka or something like that river, the lazy river that was the stroke of genius. It seems like that apparently sealed the fate of wet and wild was introducing this lazy river where you don't even have to propel yourself. You just get in this river or and you're gently pushed along by the current, along and along, and you can just chill out and not think about anything in the nice cool water on a hot day in Orlando. Yeah, and apparently when he had stole that idea, Um, the guys, the humans building this thing, was like, well, yeah, well we can build a river like you get in one and get out the other. And he's like, no, no, no no, no, this thing is fully enclosed. You never have to get out if you don't want to write. He's like, do I have to explain the concept of infinity to you? So they build it shaped like the infinity signer got fired. But and yeah, because in the middle they'd all just bumped together. They glutinated traffic jam. So I mentioned him stealing. Uh, everyone was stealing because after this water parks started opening up. It was the seventies. Everybody was stealing. Yeah, all over the country. And they they stole their names. Like every water park in the world has the same like twenty words over and over to describe their rides, and they all just from each other, like flumes and raging and wild and splash and storm and typhoon or in his case, the Kama Kaze. Well, yeah, that was the first really big in the States, at least I think he stole it from somewhere overseas from Japan. Actually it was Japan, that's try, which is appropriate and highly inappropriate to have named it the kama Kaze then, but he uh. It was the the first really tall water slide in the United States. And the way that it was allowed to be made really tall is because he used fiberglass, which revolutionized water parks because again they would use skin shredding concrete that had some real serious like structural limitations, like you had to build it into a hill. She had to build build a hill, and then you had to build the water slide into the hill. With fiberglass, it was like just build straight up into the air and you're fine, Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah, and the Kamikaze was the first one. Plus they built it and situated it in a water park in a way where you could see that thing from miles away, and it was basically like a beacon, like, come check this out, you twelve year old crazy person. Yeah, they call it a skyline feature. It's the same reason that the biggest roller coasters are going to be situated near the highway most times. So it's basically self made advertising and marketing. Um. So they also found that they could make a lot of money doing other things like selling concessions. And at first they would put the concessions all, you know, the lockers, because you're not gonna carry on money. But then they said in this article that became the mother of invention, and they were like, they invented the water wallet. And they sold a lot of bathing suits because women would come in their bikinis and get their bikini tops thrown off in these some of these rides, So they sold a lot of one piece bathing suits once people got there. Um, and it was kind of genius. They were making money hand over fist at a certain point. And this is one of the reasons why I think the seventies are possibly the greatest decade of all time. The water park was established in the seventies. Yeah, so um, these days there are some really really innovative um slides going on and we'll talk about those later. Um, first, let's take a break and then we'll get back to like how water slides actually work. So, Chuck, I promised physics, and we're going to deliver on physics. If you have listened to our roller Coaster episode, you'll probably get a lot of this. But the basic premise between a roller coaster and a person on a water slide is virtually the same thing. Like when you're on a water slide, you have when you're at the top of you're just sitting there, you like a slinky, have a lot of potential energy, and then once you shove off, that potential energy is translated into kinetic energy and gravity starts to pull you downward. That's right. And when you're traveling on a relatively straight slope, the force of gravity pushing down on your body is counteracted by the force of the slide pushing up, and you're you're going kind of slow. Sure, but if you take that slide and move it more from the horizontal to the vertical, it's still pushing you forward, but it's not counteracting gravity any longer. It's just basically allowing you to drop very quickly from a high place to a lower place. Yeah, and uh aided the whole time. Um, well, I guess combating friction, you're aided by the water. Of course, that's gonna help the friction not take hold and you won't scrape your little bottom on the concrete water slide any longer because they're sending tons and tons of water constantly down these water slide. Yes, And the the higher the drop and the steeper the grade, the less friction is allowed to generate because the less the slide is counteracting directly the force of gravity. So you can get going pretty quick. Yeah, And I remember on some of these tall slides that would have like a big drop and then a little small hill, like I remember leaving my butt leaving the slide. The concrete sly Yeah mean, no, no, this is but when they were fiber class at this point. But um, yeah, like zero friction because I'm airborne slightly. And they had missteps along the way, like sending kids off into the world, launching them from these water slides. And so they especially with the Serpentine slide, which all of a sudden you have angles introduced to the physics um and curves and inertia, and so they realized, we gotta build these walls up pretty high on some of these curves because your inertia, you're working against your own inertia. It's take in one direction and then boom, you're taking a hard left turn. Your body still wants to go that direction exactly. Slide says no, no, you're going this way now, so it adds a whole other sensation to it, not just the downward fall, but a change in velocity too. Yeah. So they raised these side walls and then eventually some of them were so extreme that they just said that you were you have to be in a tube altogether, right, completely enclosed, which is also a feature, like they have something that have like, uh, well it'll be dark and they'll have lights inside the tube and you know they've got seat them up over the years, right, they clean up real nice. So, um, well, that's pretty much the physics of water slides. There's not a whole lot else to know about it. Well, there's the water break. That's another feature. Okay, so you made mention of like, um, people being thrown all over the place. There's a story in that grant Land article where George Malay was showing, um, I guess an investor or something like that, this new slide and had one of his teen age employees go down the slide and at the bottom of the slide, um the collecting pool. Well before the collecting pool are supposed to be a dip which is filled with water and that serves as the water break. And then you've got the collecting pool, the place where you spill out into, and that's supposed to slow you down even further. Apparently the design of this slide was such that this little teenage kid wasn't really slowed down with the water break and skipped across the collecting pool onto the concrete in front of the investor who's like, Um, I don't think that's supposed to happen, right, You may want to check your numbers. Yeah, I think that may have been a sled maybe not a sled slide. Well, with a sled slide, you would guess that there's even less friction. You know, you need to have a longer water break going on. But the cool thing about the water break is that was invented by somebody who's actually one of the foremost water slide designers working today, guy named Jeff Henry. Jeff Henry's family owned like a campground in the sixties, I think Texas in Texas, and um, one of the things they had going for this campground, because you know those are usually pretty boring places, was a slide, A regular slide, yes, from the second floor. I think of one of the cabins down, not a water slide at this point, um, until Jeff added the water break feature and that became like a standard feature for all water slides. Started out on a regular slide. Yeah, And he's the guy that basically saw what Malay was doing and said I can Like he wasn't too impressed with Malay and said, I see what you're doing, but I can do this a lot better. And I think his parks today are some of the coolest ones. Right. Well, yeah, he's working. Um. He co owns um the one in Kansas City, the one with the German name. Yeah, I don't know why the name won't stick in my head. Schlitterbon, Schlitterbon. You don't know why that doesn't stick. I mean it's so memorable, sure, schliter bond Uh. That's the one that has the tallest one in the world now, right, Yeah, So the tallest one in the world is called or, which is German for crazier insane. And how high is it? A hundred and sixty eight feet and seven inches tall. The second place one is called Kilimanjaro. It's in Brazil. It's a hundred and sixty four The third one is also in Brazil. It's called Insano. It's a hundred and thirty five ft that's really tall. Man. Oh yeah, do they have little elevators for those? Do you know? Are you? I think you have to climb, which makes the whole thing even scarier. Really yeah, that's to me the worst part about the water park is, uh, the and it even puts it this way in this article. The potential energy is you climbing steps. That's how you develop the potential energy. And the higher up you go, the higher you climb, the more potential energy you have, which means the more is released in transferred to kinetic, which is scary, but you're right, it does built up like as you go. I imagine you're like, man, I've climbed a lot of steps here, I can see really really far. One of the cool things about that grant Land article too, by the way, Chuck is at the top. Rather than a photo, they have like a gift that's a p o V video of going down. It's pretty neat and I believe that is also one that uses is that a water coaster? So that is the latest and greatest um feature going is Someone at some point said it was probably uh, what's his name, Jeff? Jeff did he invent the water coaster? He said, you know, this is neat, but it would be really neat if you go up and down and you didn't just uh go down and stop and maybe a little hill here and there. But he invented I guess the water uh was it called the water cannon, water blaster, the water blaster, which is exactly what you think. It's a lot of water when you start to go up that hill to shoot you up that hill, right, it's it's um, you know, like the chains that clink you up on a roller coaster. It serves the exact same purpose. So uh with the addition of these water blasters that that move you along, um, it's just completely opened up the field of of water slides. It's just no longer using gravity to push you down. So um, chuck with with a water slide like it's This article makes a pretty good analogy that when you build a water slide, you're basically it's the same process as putting together like a matchbox track. It's the them the fiber last pieces are designed. For the most part, there's companies that design water slides. Four water parks. Rare is the water park that designs its own slides. But Jeff Henry and um the co his co owner of um Schlitterbond in Kansas City. Yeah, what is the guy's name? Do they design these together? Yes, John John School, he's the co owner's name. So they'll dream it up and then work with another company who will actually put it together or build it and then put it together. These two, yeah, they do their own designs, but for the most part of you in a water park or something, you'll contract out the whole thing, design, building, implementation, all that stuff a fun job. But this is one of the things that makes these two um some of the foremost designers is because they're they're not only owners of water parks, they're designing it themselves. They're testing it out themselves, and they're really putting a lot of thought into the water features that they're coming up with. Let's spend his life since the sixties, you know, Yeah, this is passion alright. So like you said, they are dozens and dozens of fiberglass pieces that just fit together. Like you said, like a little car track, you gotta raise lip on one end and a little sunken step and just slide them together and bolt them together boom, And what you want is to have a very smooth um single slide feel to that on your autom half. Yes, you know, once you're butt like bumping against every you know, every time there's a new section and then you have some steel that holds the thing up and there you go. You've got the world's tallest water slide. Um. One of the things, though, besides physical harm that you have to combat as a water park owner is also p Yeah. Sure, have you ever seen that South Park or the water the water park there, The concentration of PE is so much that it flips over and there's a chain reaction and everything turns to pe and like they're trapped in this water park and can't get out because everything is p it's so gross. Do they have measures in place for pin now or is it? Um? Well, just massive amounts of filtration and yes, chemicals just like in a pool, exactly right. But um, one of the ways that you combat this is to keep water circulate all the time. You don't want it to stagnate. And the other um, but honus of having water circulating all the time is you don't have to just use water once to go down the slide and then flush it down the train. A water slide is basically a closed circuit, and actually most water parks, or at least several of the features in the water park are closed systems themselves, so like the water will circulate through several different parts of the park in a closed system. Right, all right, Well we'll talk a little bit more about these pump hounds is and how that all works right after this break. All right, Josh, you mentioned um pumps. This water doesn't move itself, you know, I mean gravity helps on the way down. Yeah, I guess it does. You need to get it up right to the top of the slide her for this all to work correctly. And to do that you just use some pumps. You put a pump at a smart location, say a collection sump, and in most cases this is the pool that's at the bottom of the water for the um water slide that they fall into, right, and that water, that water is collected and sucked out and run through a filter, which is pretty simple. It sounds like filters for water parks. I'm sure, I'm sure get more technologically advanced than this, but at their basis, they um the waters run through a layer of sand and a layer of gravel, and the edges of the sand and the gravel pick out fine particulate matter, hopefully proteins from urine and um. The water, the clean water, the cleaner water is run through the other end and up to the the water slide and then down again. Yeah. And most of these slides, especially the ones where you have to work water all the to the top, have um one way valves or check valves. And that means at the end of the night, when they turn everything off and clock out and go to the local beer and pizza joint to I'll hang out, because that's what all water park employees do, right, It's like summer camp. They the water stays at the top. It stays in that pipe. It doesn't flow backward because then you would have to work to get it all pump back up to the top again every morning. Yeah. So it's a one way system and it just stays ready to go when they turn it on at the beginning of the day. They take their advil and wipe the crust from their eyes too. Pizza. Uh. They turn on that pump switch and the water is just right there at the top, rady to be uh. Squirted back out. Um. Backwashing is very important feature. If you ever worked at a pool or owned a pool, you know how to backwash and that is another uh sanitation method which you will reverse the flow of water through the filter and backwash it and it moves back through it cleans all the crud that the filter caught out. Yeah, and then pumps it out into the sewer system exactly. It's a very important part. It doesn't pump it back out into the collection pool because that would be so gross. That's right. And they're always pumping new water in there too, because you're losing a lot of water throughout the day as well. Yeah, people's bathing suits carry that water away evaporation. Sure, all that stuff. And as much pe as they're adding, they still need to add water, which is good. Um. Did you read the bit on Action Park? Yeah? Man, so this is pretty cool. It's I read and watched that documentary about a year ago, and uh, it was amazing. I can't say enough about the Mashable. Um, did they actually do the documentary? I think they hosted it. Okay. It was a park in New Jersey, the deadliest amusement park in the history of the world. Apparently. Yeah, it was called Action Park, and it was from the seventies till I think, and um, it had such a horrible track record of causing injuries and just being insanely flagrant with Yeah, pretty much that had the name Traction Park. Um. And there's a legend that the Smashable Articles or was it the New York Post, which now I'm questioning the veracity of this legend. But um that Action Park bought ambulances for the local township because they used them so much. Well, it's pretty cool. If you watch the documentary interviews, Uh, it details the features of the park, which are all, um, you seem like you were teetering on the edge of injury at all times. And um, but when you entered. They interviewed a lot of people that were now adults that went there as teenagers and they were like, Action Park was the best thing ever. Well, and the reason why it wasn't just because they didn't care about your safety. Yet. They had really cool rides to Like, they had a water slide that made a pleat loop and that's not water slides don't do that normally. Yeah, it was a tube and if you look at this thing they have video of someone going through it. Um, it seems like the way Action Park was laid out, it wasn't like it was a sort of piecemeal like this thing looks like it was just built in a parking lot. Uh. And it was a complete and closed tube and you would just go down, do one loop and get spit out the other end. And it didn't always work great though. It's a problem. Yeah, it didn't always spit you out the other end. You might get stuck, broken or whatever in the in the loop. Yeah, it seems pretty great. They're like everyone across the board had fond memories. Um. And I know in the seventies we all like pat ourselves on the back for having you know, we didn't Yeah, we didn't have bicycle helmets and like we were all dangerous and our parents didn't care. But um, that sort of was the heyday, you know, like when kids were just left to their own devices and apparently everyone that worked there it was just like a really fun time. Like the cards are party in, the kids were partying. It was just a good old time at Action Park. So they're bringing it back now, right they are. After this this documentary went viral. Um and it's like a web documentaries. I don't think it's feature length or anything like that. But um, the once they went viral, the former owners were like, oh, okay, well I guess there's still demand for Action Park, so they bought back the old Action Park and it's the family business, right Yeah. And the the they basically said the recent owners who they sold it to back in the nineties made everything way too safe. So they've said about making the rides more dangerous, which is nuts. Yeah, they're probably walking that fine line, especially these days litigation and kids feeling like they're, you know, in peril. Yeah, it makes more exciting. I came across another article, um that basically said if you are worried about roller coasters, you should be way more worried about water parks. Yeah. The death rate is much higher, isn't it. Yeah, the in the injury rate, the incident rate, for sure. So um, there was It was a study in New Jersey, which is where Action Park is. Um. But the studies between two thousand and seven and two twelve, So this is while Action Park isn't even operating, so it's not adding to these statistics. But one fifth of all amusement park accidents in New Jersey between those years where water park attractions, whereas only like thirty nine incidents were due to roller coasters, So like a hundred and twenty out of like five hundred something where things like, um, drownings in a collection pool or just injuries on a water slide, that kind of stuff. So if you're afraid of roller coasters, you should be way more afraid of water slide. Yeah. The one thing that I read in that article that made sense to me was they said that, um, with a roller coaster, you're generally looking at some sort of a malfunction, mechanical malfunction that causes injury. But water is unpredictable. It's not on a track, and sometimes you know, it does whatever the heck it pleases, that does whatever it wants, and maybe someone's size and weight will contribute to it in such a fashion where um, it's yeah, you're taking its humble and breaking a leg or something. Good times. I can't wait to go again. I got one last step for you once you got There are twelve water parks in North America. You know how many in the rest of the world. Wow? Really, yeah, crazy, it's the North American tradition. It is um. I used to love the Lazy River. What I would do is my friends and I would play hide and go seek in the Lazy River, which was fun. You basically get like five or six dudes because we didn't play with girls. You know, we were scared of them, and one of them would kind of hang back and the other ones would get in and then you'd wait like thirty seconds or whatever, and then you jump in the Lazy river and they'd have a little head start and you would, Uh, we would spend hours due playing hide and go seeking this thing because you would us creep along behind some uh you know, some big fat guy on a on a raft. You would just sort of hide behind him and see your friends swim by. And you know, you can swim with the current go super fast, so there are all sorts of techniques of hiding and evading and capture. It was pretty fun. That is pretty cool, man, that's awesome. I think we would spend like half our day doing that because we realized standing in line for a water slide is for the birds.

All you had to say was Murph. Yeah, he's our our friend. It's a teacher and um sends this stuff sometimes. Yeah, in part time put putt golf course worker. And he wrote in about slinky's he said, he guys, as you know, I teach history and science, and in science class I do use a slinky to demonstrate concepts and physics that they may find hard to understand. What I do is I hold up as slinky with a class to see, um it is uncompressed or slinked. And I asked the students what they think will happen if I drop it, and response is always it will fall Mr Murphy up or down. Though, kids, then I drop it and it naturally falls, and they look at me like I'm unfit to teach. Uh. Then I use their cell phones or my cell phone and record the drop in slow motion to demonstrate the fact that, uh, information of an object state takes time to permeate. This is what you were talking about, remember, uh, and what this means for the slinky? Um to know that when it's dropped, it takes time to move as a wave through this ink. The slinky until the status quo of the slinkys ends are matched, stays closed. That science maybe political science. Basically, one end of the slinky moves and follows by the other end remains motionless, floating until the information reaches the motionless end and says you can fall now, which is what we talked about at the end there. I like how he put it. Yeah, so you do this in class and um, kids are amazed and delighted. I'm sure. Yeah, finally ste the slow motion camera fon. That's from Tyler Murphy and um, thanks Murphy.
