Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast this creepy, creepy podcast. It's not even Halloween. Bill, come in. I'm Josh. That's Chuck. This stuff you should know? How you do it? I'm well, sir, good Chuck. Um. It's gonna sound like a bad editor to our producer Jerry for that one, though. It is just weird, Chuck. I think I speak for everybody when I say I want to hear about one of your favorite movies. One called Doctor Strange Love subtitled or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb? Great great film. Do you like this one as well? I've only seen parts of it here, I've never seen the whole thing. You continually disappoint me cinematic. I can't help it. It's all I ever do, Chuck, Yeah, that was I think. In nine four, Stanley Kubrick's awesome, awesome, awesome movie, I did like Eyes Wide Shut. I made my entire family go to the theater to see it for my birthday. You're kidding, there was a row of uncomfortable people seated on either side of me. Was hilarious. I like that movie too, but I can't imagine taking my mother. Um. Anyway, getting back to Kubrick. Uh. Yeah, Dr Strangelove um starred Peter Sellers in three different roles, as a doctor Strangelove, as an army officer in England, and as the President of the United States. That sounds familiar. Yeah, toward a force performance. It was awesome. It was the parts he was born to play. But I know I bring this up because Doctor Strangelove. The character of Doctor Strangelove was a Nazi. Well you know, the US used to like to poach Nazi uh scientists after the war, you know. Well, and that's exactly what happened in the movie. And um, he has a condition. Even though they don't speak of it in the film, Um, it's pretty clear once you know something about it. It's alien hand syndrome. What's going on there? And he loses control of his arm and he does the zeke kil and beats his arm into submission and it's really really funny. He has some real trouble with it. I remember he does. Yeah, So I think that's very appropriate that we just talked about that movie, Chuck, because this very podcast is about alien hands syndrome. How nuts is that? I know? It's almost as if we planned it. Yeah kind of so chuck. Um, this one's yours. I would like everybody to go ahead and read this by my Um, it's called how Alien hand Syndrome Works. It was written by my colleague, uh and love of my life, Charles W. Bryant go On, who I could never do without go on, um and uh. Basically, alien hands syndrome was first recognize the nineteen o nine I understand it was first described by the Germans, right, and Um, it wasn't until nineteen seventy two that it really became part of the medical lexicon or accepted by the medical establishment. Am I correct? Yeah? Okay, So since nineteen o nine when it was first noticed, Uh, um, there's been fifty cases or less, yeah documented. I mean, that's the definition of extremely rare. So what is it? I mean, are these people just crazy? What's the deal? Well? I should point out though, that there are possibly a lot of other cases that have never been officially diagnosed. But it's still really rare, is it? Because they were mistaken for crazy. Maybe I would say so, because what happens, um, when you have alien hand syndrome is your hand, one of your hands will involuntarily start doing something and you don't know what's happening until you look down and see your hand. If you're a sleep you might even know what's happening. Uh wait, waiting, wait, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry because I didn't I wasn't aware of this. This can go on while you're sleeping. I did not know that. Yeah, I can go on while you're sleep. Um. So what happens is your hand just starts doing things and it's all purpose oriented, which is one of the most fascinating parts of it. Like your hand will grab the remote control and change the channel, or tear at your shirt, un button your shirt. And it seems like something out of a movie. But it's real. It is real. It's crazy, but there's some science behind it, which I know you're into. Well, first of all, of what I understand, there's four main hallmarks to this. Uh this I guess disease or disorder. UM. One is that the the U I guess offending limb feels like it's foreign. Right. Another hallmark is that when you're not looking at it. Yes, that's that's an even better way to put it. Um, when you're not looking at it, it it doesn't feel like it's a part of your body or that it's attached. Maybe, um, and that they're people who have suffered from alien hand syndrome have trouble distinguishing between um, what's voluntary movement like oh, I want to grab that cup of coffee, and what the alien hand is doing. It doesn't seem to them that it's coming from the same place, although it is, which I know we'll get to in a second, right. Uh. And then the fourth one is that, um, the limb is often personified like it has its own um, its own personality. Maybe you call it Roger. Well, a lot of people do name the limb. Is Roger a popular name? I bet it's number one? But Roger in the hand. So those are the four hallmarks, Chuck, Yes, all right, Um, but what's what? Let's talk about the brain, the aspects of the brain that are thought to be responsible for this. Yeah, we've learned a lot about the brain ourselves from doing this podcast. It's pretty amazing. The number one thing I've learned is that we know almost nothing about the brain. I know. Yeah, we can put man on the moon, which happened and supposedly supposedly, and we still don't even know exactly what's going on with brain function. Uh. They do know that there are you know, certain things like two hemispheres for lobes. Literalization of brain function, which we've talked about. Explain that real quick. Well, literal literalization of brain function is uh say, the left side of the brain being more detail oriented while the right side of the brain evaluates the big picture. So the brain functions are lateralized, one side responsible for one thing and the others for the other. You did such a good job there, I'm gonna ask you to explain alien hand syndrome with the brain, okay, And actually I have to tell you I went behind your back and I did a little additional research. I came up with a couple of other things too, did Will you forgive me? I can take it all right? So there there's one really clear away that alien hands syndrome is is created and that is a usually a lesion on the corpus colossum, which, as you so actually put it in the article, is like the brain's email server. It's a bundle of nerves that are important in communication between the hemispheres and different regions of the brain. Right you need the key to the brain is to have the lobes and hemispheres all working together. And that happens thanks to something, you know, the corpus closum. Right. So, um, when when that doesn't happen and the brains aren't the regions of the brain are communicating with each other, specifically, say the frontal lobe, which is involved in planning and organizing action, right Uh, when that happens, uh, say it's it can't send a message to the motor strip, which actually carries out those movements. Right Um. When that happens, the motor strip isn't dead, It's still functioning. So it may just be sending random messages to your arm to say, grasp that, you know, grasp that shirt and pull at it. Oh, it's your shirt, but do it anyway, that kind of thing. So that so whenever there's a there's a malfunction again usually caused by a legion on the corpus colossal where the the frontal lobe and the motor strip um are engaged in telling each other what's going on. There is this purposeless motion which is alien hand syndrome, and really think about it. Purposeless motion is basically just um and and motor activity out of context. There's no context to it. So I mean, like all of a sudden, your hands grabbing a coffee mug. Right, Um, but it seems foreign and weird because you don't understand why you didn't form the thought that said I need that coffee cup, right, which I guess makes the whole thing kind of chilling in need and even worse, chuck. There's no there's no curious there, no, there is no cure. Um. You know. They've done some studies is is recently as two thousand seven. But one of the reasons they haven't done that many studies over the years is because it's so rare that just just say that and it's not Um, I guess you could say it's not dangerous. It's more of a nuisance than anything. There have been really really rare cases where someone's like choke themselves to death. No no, no no, I'm not to death, but they found their hands like creeping up around their throat, which is really creepy. But um, since it's not that Since it's so rare and since it doesn't do any real damage to your body, they haven't really been interested in studying it that much. But they did in two thousand seven a bit and put people in an fMRI machine and they found, you know, they basically said what you just said, which is the motor strip has been singled out as a center of activity, even though they don't know what triggers it. It's still shooting messages, but it's not it's not taking orders any longer for that one side of the of the body, that one limb from the frontal lobe. Also, there's another thing. Um. It's kind of a variation on um alien hand syndrome, which by the way, is also called antarchic hand um and doctor strange life syndrome. Yeah, is that for real? Yeah? Yeah, I think it's probably like a more casual term that doctors use, especially if they're kubric fans. Right. So, UM, there's a it's kind of a variation on it. It's caused by damage to the parietal lobe UM and usually what it results in is a basically a levitation of the hand UM and it's I can't tell if it's dominant the dominant hand like um with with with corpus colossal damage corpus colossalm damage. Usually that is the non dominant hand. So if you're right handed, your left hand is gonna be alien hand. If you have actual damage to the frontal lobe, that usually results in the dominant hand. If you're right handed, your right hand would have alien hand syndrome. Damage to the prioral lobe doesn't go one way or the other necessarily, But what happens is, especially when you close your eyes, um, the hand will start to levitate because they're no longer in sync um and it makes you know, dressing kind of difficult, that kind of thing. Uh. So, pridal lobe damage, since the pridal lobe is responsible for sensation and sensory um input, when you close your your eyes, your hand just kind of goes a little wacky because, like like you said in the article, visual cues kind of are very important in associating your hand with your body when when it's dissociated like this right. Uh, And like you said, there's no cure, Um, I think you said that. I think you said it. Either way you said it, Uh, there's no cure. A lot of times there that seems humorous, but people will do things like, um, wear an oven met or keep their hand occupied by giving it something to hold onto. And some cases is so severe that they've actually like tie their hands behind their back. Wow. I know, wow, Um, but josh, we're not done yet. One of the things I thought was interesting was all the different times the alien and syndrome has been portrayed in somewhere another in books and TV and movies. Yeah. I like this point you made. Yeah, that that it's as many as there have been real cases, or more there have been. Uh, it's been depicted on the silver screen, in small screen. And he goes back all the way to the film Mad Love, followed an obsessed doctor who replaced the hands of would be lover's husband with those of a knife wielding murderer. Yeah. I looked this movie up because I hadn't heard of it before, and um, it's actually um the mad doctors played by Peter Lorii. And he's totally bald like Peter Laurie's not creepy looking enough. He has his his head as ball as the baby's butt, and he looks really creepy interesting like he I'm sure he played the part very very well. The Adams Family. Josh. Actually I've watched um those I think all well, two of those movies recently. They're actually really good movies. Yeah, my brother worked on the second one, good stuff. Young La Ricci had a crush on him. Really, it is true, but she was you know, do you think she remembers him? Now? I bet she does. She sent him Christmas kifts for a couple of years. And Angelica Houston had the hot sporn. Dude, what my brother is a handsome guy, I guess. So, um, off track there, but interesting nonetheless, um, Adam's family had the thing, which wasn't quite alien hand syndrome, but it was like an exactly but doing its own things, purposeful things. So yeah, it was also very helpful a lot too, drove the Getaway Car professor. Yeah, so I chuck. Yeah. I find it interesting too that, um, that Hollywood has this fascination with it and well all so creepy and cool and unknown and it is. But at the same time, apparently modern medicine doesn't have as much of an interest as Hollywood does. Mr sad So get to it. Physicians and uh medical researchers have also writes and While you're doing that, we're going to do some listener mail. Josh, you know what we're doing, Hiku Theater. I'm ready for this, Chuck. I've been waiting for this kind is. I'm very psyched about this. The hikus are rolling in at an unprecedented rate. Veronica thirteen. It's hot in winter, all the people start to melt. Welcome to Texas. So I'm guessing from Texas? Yeah? Uh. This one is from Crystal Duqui. I found your podcast. I just could not get enough. Told Chuck, I love y'all. He sent me a pick, which I added to my shrine. Just kidding, not nuts, keep up the gray work. Can't wait to hear the next one. Why Chuck love Hikus. It's an excellent question. It is, uh, diego Garcia, Philadelphia, consider the city of brotherly love. Glasses caked with philth Nanners, yogurt, strawberry smoothie aftermath. Yes, so you must have made one of my sumothies. Uh Andy sixteen from I of Ho says I want to suggest a podcast about Greek myths that would be so boss and I love the use of the word boss there. And we have two more Sandra Thompson of Irvine, California. I learned neat things when listening on the train. Then the song I'm sad and I guess the music that she's talking about is the the altro music the end, I'm sure at the end of the podcast, little thanks for that. And then we got one from Bob capital b O b exclamation point. Bob is how he says his name, apparently, and he wrote us a limerick, but explained that he would do so in the form of a high coup. I'm not sure that's possible, he said. It ain't a high kup. It's a limerick. You see. Hope you enjoy it. And now the limerick, the edited version. It's Friday today, a day for bad luck, so they say, so, I'll damn Josh and Chuck because they have all the luck. Let's keep out of misfortune's way. Fantastic gosh, Thank you, Bob, Bob, and thanks to everybody who wrote in. Whether you send us at haiku or otherwise, um and if you have not done so yet, you can send us something the email.
