Josh: If you've ever been at home and wondered, Josh and Chuck is it really worth going to see them perform live? The answer is a resounding yes yes. And if you live in Vancouver, b C. Or anywhere near there, come on out to the Chance Center on Sunday March to see us and find out for yourself. And then the next night, if you live around Portland, Oregon, you can go to the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall and we'll be there ready to go on Monday March. That's right. You can get all ticket information at s y s K live dot com. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant over there, and there's Jerry. Jerry's back everybody that's right. And all the listeners said, what happened to Josh TV? What are we doing that? Did we decide? Yeah, we're gonna do birthmarking? Check the title? Chuck, Well, I mean I have two things in front of me. How are you doing? I'm great? How are you? I'm good? You got any birth marks? I do what you got Um, I've got something under my right armpit. You're like, it looks like Richard Nixon. Close, it looks like Spiro Agne. Do you remember when Mad magazine used to make fun of Spiro Agne And you're like, I have no idea who that gets the name. Maybe no, it's because like they hated his politics, but too. But then there was a Simpsons where Millhouse is like, they're making fun of Spiro agnew again. He must work there or something, and I remember specifically thinking that he referenced Mad Magazine. That's funny. Yeah, so you you've got an under your armpit birthmark? Yeah, how about you? I don't think I do. Actually, what I have a lot of now because I'm an old man speeding toward death. Our skin tags, oh yeah, around the neck and armpit. That's where they like tend to gather. That's just your skin, you know, really going at it. I used to have them clipped, and I did. I did that for a while, but it's been a while, but now I went in recently. It was so annoying. It was one of these our medical system is just broken. It was one of those reminders because I went in to get it taken care of like I usually do. And I got in there and the guy was like, oh, well, we don't do this now unless you make another kind of appointment. I was like, well, can I just make this that since I'm here sitting in your office. He's like, no, no, no, those take much longer. These are just ten minute appointments and that that'll take like an hour, and some of them have their own vascular systems so they need to be cauterized. And I was like, oh, okay, so I'm just leaving and he's like yes, He's like, if you want to make that other appointment, and then they refunded the money for that appointment, which was the copey, but then said make the longer appointment if you want to come back, which I'm gonna yeah. You know. I mean they're not like medically dangerous or anything, but their brother unsightly when they get long and big, well long, sure, I mean how long are we talking like? I mean some of the ones are like, you know, quarter inch, so okay, I was just about to say how big that one? Let me see if I can figure it out in the metric. It's a few centimeters, so I think it's what you just want to get him clipped again, So I'm gonna make that longer appointment, right, I think it will be painful? Is it painful? I've never had one clip the regular clipping. The small ones aren't a big deal because they just hit it with a little quick shot and then clip it in. This no big deal. But what kind of a shot like a you know, needle, like a little numbing, numbing thing. Okay, I like with a needle like whatever. I don't know if they don't they don't spray it with the freezy stuff. No, you're thinking of this stuff for athletes foot This is like a shot light of cane. But anyway, the ones that are big that require cauterizing, I'm sure that doesn't feel great, even if they've numbed it up and just get the seedline torch out And imagine I'll have to shave my armpits because if you're torching something near armpit hair, plus you just want to look good. Maybe I've never shaved my pits. Um might start that I used to? Why not? I'll bet that's itchy though. Yeah. Maybe anytime you shave something that starts to grow out, it's itchy. You know what? I'm saying, so um. I used to get warts actually when I was a kid. Oh yeah, And I remember going into the dermatologists and they go into the freezer, put on these huge rubber gloves and pull out like this thermos of I want to say, nitro glystroom. That's not it, and now you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, the cold stuff. Yeah, and it would freeze my wart basically right off right there, just kind of sting for a second. That was it. I never really had warts. Believe me, buddy, you lucked out because if you're a little kid in grade school and you have like it wasn't like I wasn't coated with them, but you know, like i'd get one like here between my four finger and my thumb. I had one of my elbow or something like that. Other kids jerks zero in on that stuff, and you're the you're the little weird kid who was already the fat kid now with warts new and improved. Uh. I had freckles a lot more than I do now, because freckles tend to fade as you get older, and freckles are I guess kind of well, they're not a kind of birthmark because you're not born with freckles, but I did look into it. Freckles are just an abundance of melanin, like collected together. Well, that's basically what a mole is, which is a type of birthmark if you're born with it. That's right. So I love freckles though. Freckles are super cute. Freckles are great, Moles are great. Birthmarks, especially interesting ones are great. Sports are great. That's why the term warts and all came about it. That's how you should love his true Chuck Man, quit making the people kids. Well, that's a thing, so mean. Birthmarks have been around since the dawn of humanity, I'm guessing, um, and people have probably been ostracized because their birthmarks since the dawn of humanity. And you know, for a very long time people were ostracized for their birthmarks because of some really stupid ideas like that it meant you were a witch, or it meant you were touched by Satan, all sorts of stuff like that. Um. And then over time it got a little more innocuous. But even still today there are parts of the world where you can find people who are ostracized because their birth marks. And then even in the developed world, the Western world, which is rational and based more on science. You can still find yourself, you know, at the receiving end of being ostracized. Maybe not because you're a witch, but just because you have a birthmarker you look different and so um. I've seen parents react to it if their baby has like a strawberry mark on their head, yes like that, seeing them feel the need to say like, oh, you know this is you know, we'll go away, or something like that. I was reading this birthmark support group from Great Britain and they were saying this. One mom had cards printed up explaining what her child's birthmark was because sometimes she just couldn't. She just didn't have it together enough to to have a conversation with the stranger who'd walked up and been like, what's up with your kid's face? Rather than belt um, she would just give him a card and then just probably go home and weep or something like that, knowing not for herself but the life that her kid was going to have to face, not because her kid has a birthmark, but because the rest of the world are schmucks. Yes, that's the that's the long and short of its right. Al managed to find a soapbox. Even in the birthmarks episode, I bet a kid, probably a collection of kids could still make you cry if they started. They started, I just started kicking, throwing elbows. I just hold my arms out and started twirling around really fast, and whatever got hit got hit. People be like a Josh fighting a bunch of children and be like, yeah, they made fun of them. Yeah, they'd be like I shoved one in a grocery store once. Oh man, I'll never forget that, lady. So let's talk birthmarks, Chuck. It turns out there's a lot to know. Yeah, they're um usually not a big deal. They aren't painful, they're usually harmless. A lot of times they go away. We're gonna detail the ones that do and that don't go away, and the ones that are of more concern. But generally speaking, science doesn't really know why they come about to begin with, but they are something that doctors will sometimes want to keep an eye on. And that's the intro. That's Intro number seven. Yeah, there's a couple of big categories, uh, vascular and pigmented. And let's talk about some of these. Vascular are usually reddish because they have to do with blood vessels. Yeah, I think reddish is a very common When you think birthmarks, you think reddish. Typically I think brownish, brownish too. Um. Apparently they can come in a whole rainbow of colors blue, brown, black, pink, white, although I take issue with that purplish or tan. And I take an issue with white because I think white is like a reverse birthmark, although technically it would still count as a birthmark. So the whole rest of your body is a birthmark, and that one little right, Okay, that's right. Um. Birthmarks tend to be an aggregation of either pigment or blood, as we'll see, and white is like an area where pigment is absent, So I guess it still counts as a birthmark, but it's not really a birthmark. If you go into a dermatologist office, they'll be like, he got this all wrong. Uh. And like we said, the skin tags and freckles and things like that, they come later in life, although freckles can start out very early. But it's still not a birthmark because you're not born with that mark. Yeah. And even as we'll see, some types of moles don't technically qualify as birth marks, even though they typically fall under the banner of birth marks. You have to be born with something for it to count as a birthmark, that's right, So that's not even fully true. As we'll see, this is just full applies. Everybody who studies birth marks needs to get their stuff together. So the macular uh um, they're called flat sometimes macular stains, and we're in the vascular right, This is the non pigmented. These are usually caused by blood in large blood vessels. These have some cute names that go along with them, angel kisses. I think some of these can be because of where they're found, although I've heard people cross referencing. Like I think an angel kisses usually on the forehead, but not always. A stork bite is usually on the back of the neck. That makes sense, But I've also when you google stork bite there's some like right on the tip of the nose, and people call them that. I took it to me more like, um, that those those names were derived from the age that they're like kids who are born with this and then it tends to go away at an early age. That's what it's associated with, you know, like the stork brings the baby and the angels, well, everybody agels love babies. What about the salmon patch. I don't understand it at all. Uh, they are usually above the neck um. They usually or a lot of times they'll disappear and and fade away by the time they're two to three years old, but not always. Sometimes the last Yeah, but for the most part, if you have a macular flat vascular birthmark on your kid, they're probably going to outgrow it. Is just really no other way to put They outgrow that birthmark eventually, that's right. Most often, port wine stains are a whole different ball game. Yes, they said they look like kind of what they sound like. They're usually kind of a purplish red where it looks like, uh, well port or wine has been spilled. I would know nothing about what a wine spill looks like, right, because you never ever spill all your wine. It all makes it into your mouth. That's right. I've seen it, so port Weinstein, I say, that's like a whole different kettle of fish. Um, it's in the same uh category as macular because they're vascular. It's like an aggregation of overdeveloped blood vessels kind of close to the skin. But they seem to come from like a whole different um place a whole there's a whole different reason. And in fact we should say this chuck, because this is really important. If you go up to a dermatologist or anybody who would know what they're talking about, and you say, hey, where did birth marks come from? What causes birth marks? They would say, we actually don't know. Um. The closest that they've come is with port wine stains. From what I can tell, they figured out that there's a genean um where the this molecular switch that's supposed to go on and off is locked in the on position, and that they think that this is what causes port wine stains. And the reason that they found it is because about six percent of kids who are born with the port Win stain birth birthmark developed something called Sturge Webber syndrome, which is a neurological condition. Interesting and it's if you have a port wine stain birth market does not mean you have Sturge Webber, but if you have Sturge Webber, you have a port wine birth mark. Six percent of birth port wine birth marks um cases have Sturge Webber. It's actually a symptom, but of people with that condition have right the port wine stain. Yeah, and so in investigating the syndrome and the link between it and the port win Stein birthmark, they found this gene that they think is the culprit. All right, Well, they never go away. A lot of times, they'll get darker as you become older. Uh. And these are not a big deal healthwise either, unless it's something near your eyes that can affect your vision, and then they might want to take a look at it. I also saw that in some cases they can start to get lumpy and actually become disfiguring as you age too. I did see those, and they can also just once they lump, they can scar too. So um, a lot of people seek treatment for port wine stain birth marks. As we'll see. Yeah, strawberry marks is what I referenced at the beginning. You might see these on little babies. Uh. They are haman gioma's is it right? Yeah, and these most of the times, Um, I saw even less than thirty percent. But it says your thirty percent are visible at birth most of the times though. They'll develop between four and six weeks, and I think by the time you hit six months, if you're gonna have one, it will be visible by that point. You won't develop one of these at like the one year mark. No. But again that's there's that one. There's that loophole where it's like you it still counts as a birthmark even though you weren't technically born with It drives me up the wall, right, And these are um a little more reddish. And you've probably seen these, like I said, on babies before, because they're you know, they're pretty common. Um, they will they have they're raised off the skin. That's kind of one of the differentiators is they're not flat so um like hamageum hamage. I've said it like five times in my head, hamaggiomas fifty times probably yes, and I can't say it out loud. Hamaggioma's um macular and port wine seems like we said, these are all over developed blood vessels, clusters of blood vessels there. They're from blood vessels, which is which is why they have that that reddish pigment is because the blood is close enough to the skin and it's clustered together. It's kind of almost pooled right there, right, But it's not like a bruise or any thing like that. It's the blood hasn't escaped. The vessel is just a lot of vessels, are big vessels all clumped together near the skin. What's interesting about maggiomas i did it? Chuck? Ha? Maggioma's nice work? Um him angiomas oh Man, did I miss it twice? I think there's an end in there that it's being forgotten. What's interesting about what you just mentioned is that in some cases they can extend down into the body, and the further they extend down, they won't be reddish, they'll be bluish. Yeah, and they can even be on the organs. It's pretty rare, but it happens. It is, and they can be threatening on the organs. You don't want to have a cluster of blood vessels on your organs. But back to the blue part. So the reason that they look blue is because, as everybody knows, um blood on its way back to the lungs to be oxygenated is blue. That's right, that's not true. I'm sorry to set you up like that. I thought it was true. That's why your morning veins are blue. It's not. And as soon as you get cut and it hits that sweet, sweet oxygen, that just transforms into red. That's what you thought, right, that's what not what I thought as an adult, but that's what I thought as a small child. That's what I thought until this morning. No, yeah, you knew that. No, really, you thought blood was blue? Yes, I thought deoxygen eated blood was blue. Okay, Well do you understand why it appears blue? Well, I mean no, but I just knew that that was like a playground falsehood. Well I was too busy veins are blue, thinking about how we're fighting up it was covered with to learn this. You're like, I'm gonna draw some sweet blue blood out of that jerky with my fists. The reason it's blue is because the deeper it is, the less blue light is able to penetrate, so the less that can be absorbed, and so the light that's reflected tends to be blue more than say red, which penetrates deeper and is absorbed. That has to do with blue foods too, which is a bit for the next episode. Thank you, just put a pin in that. Uh. These strawberry marks though, back to those, they will disappear usually by the time a kid is like into double digits. Um. If they're large, sometimes you might see a scar. These are around the head and neck as well and are most commonly found on Caucasian girls. But they're not They don't have a real impact on development either. Um. But if they are really big and puffy again, they could and around the eyes or ears, they could interfere with hearing and vision and stuff like that. Right. Yeah, and if you if they're on the on your internal organs, it's a problem. So I think we should take a break because astoundingly we're twenty minutes in and we have not taken a break. Um, So we'll be back to birth marks right after this. Okay, to recap, Remember, vascular blood birth marks are reddish because of blood vessels. Precisely, if anyone misses that question on the quiz tomorrow, your toast is not our fault. So the other kind of birth marks are pigment at birth marks nothing to do with blood vessels. Oh I don't know. There could be a blood vessel or too involved, but no, not really. No, this is because like freckles, like I was telling about, it is just a collection of melanine that's brought out by its unexposure. Yeah, and you have melana sites, melanin cells, melantonin cells, or melanin, one of the two all over your body. It gives you, like the color to your skin. Some people have more, some people have last, but everybody has them. But like you were saying, when they kind of congregate together, that's when they form these pigmented spots that we know as birthmarks. Right, we are in our house, my daughters at the age now where she has started to notice skin color, which is something that you you know, every parent has to deal with at some point. And uh, that's how it was recommended to us to talk about it with scientifically being like, hey, everyone's the same, which got different skin tones because of science, some people have more melanin than other people. Is that why you had me over to dinner and started asking me about that? Yeah, you just wound me up and knew. I go, huh, that's right. So um, but I mean that is tricky stuff for parents because what you're really talking about is the first talks of race, you know, and you just you you have to do it in such a way that diffuses it almost so it's just like, no, everyone's the same. Some people are lighter skin, some people are darker skinned. Both of her best friend Zo or multiracial, which helps. Oh, yeah, I'm sure because we can say you know your friend blank. I'm not gonna say names Jerry Blank. She has two friends are both named blank. Um, we can just say you know her skin is a little darker than yours, because you know when you see her parents and try to explain all that, and kids are like, oh, okay, how does this matter? Why does this have to do a big bird, big bird yellow? That's a great question. But these have some cute names too, and they are almost um, well, that's not true. I was going to say they aren't. They're named because of what they look like. But really, just the one is. Yeah, there's really just two types of pigment of birthmarks, or broad categories of it. Yes, the very Parisian cafe latte, Oh cafe l A, Sorry, I just read that A lot tastes different. This has nothing to do with vascular um aggregations of blood vessels. No, And do you get confused on coffee orders or do you know all that stuff? I'm pretty pretty good with it. I don't know what any of them are like anytime someone it's all just a differing amounts of milk, steamed milk, yeah. But like when I hear like a maciato or an Americano American, what these things are a shot of espresso or multiple shots with ultra hot water, right, that's an Americana. I think that's what our friend Chad Crowley drinks. It's it's just a really really really hot black coffee. Okay, that's all interesting, Marcioto, you got me. I don't know, like cappuccino, there's a lot there's like more foam than milk milk. I know those two. It's all just milk or foam or coffee. What's a cafe? A cafe l a is simply coffee with milk. That's it, really, that's what that's literally what it means in French is that like the what's it called in uh in Spanish? Cafe? Okay, that's the same thing then with milk. Okay, I am a dummy. I haven't been drinking. It's not it's not that. It's just it's not that. As you can see, I'm still drinking my uh from this morning. Those are great, aren't they? And it's still hot thanks to And I'll go ahead and plug it the Zoji roushi and I've plugged this on our page before. Like, if you like your coffee hot all day, get one of these little Thermisis this thing keeps this thing hot for ten hours? It really does? Yeah, so much? So I have the same one. You has a little pinquents cute. When I pour coffee in, I have to like pour the coffee into a mug to let it cool off. Have to put it in there because you won't be able to drink it. No, like maybe the next day you could. It keeps it that hot, for sure. We need to get them as a sponsor. Man. They also make out of this world rice cookers too. Uh yeah, I've got Well now, I'm not sure if that's the one I have or another one. I think those are the two best ones in my opinion. I can't remember, bro, I have to look, But all I know is the one I have is very forgiving. You can be pretty off with your measurements and it still makes perfect rice. You can use like butter milk and somehow it still comes out just oh man, buttermilk. That could be all right. Well, here's a little tip for you. You make sushi rice, okay um. Usually you just do a one to one rice to water ratio. Then go in and just put like half like a teaspoon half teaspoon, even depending on how tiny you want to be of rice vinegar. Oh well sure, I usually add that after No, No, you want to pick it together? Yeah, so you want to cook it with it? Yes? Okay. I used to make my own sushi rolls, and then I just got to the point where I was like, it's not worth it. It's just a lot easier to get sushi. Where did you get your your seafood? Uh? Sorry? I would get that at um the decab farmer's market. I would get the tuna there and the crab sticks, which that's easy. Can get that it Kroger's and the seaweed there. But then there's also a Japanese market nearby where I would get the eel to a bacon the oven. But that's kind of a you know, you could do spicy tuna, tuna eel and crabstick California rolls. I really want some sushi right now. I we both eat a lot of sushi. Yeah it's good. Okay. So Cafe A birthmark, So that is the Cafe l A. They are the color of a Cafe l A kind of a light brown, which means coffee with milk. Yep. There and this is to me was when I think birthmark, I think of these because it's just a little brown spot anywhere on the body. Yeah, and that's I think. One of the things we didn't say is with some of the birthmarks there is kind of specific places that they'll appear, yeah, um or they're tied to specific places usually, but with cafe A birthmarks in particular, they're just they got no rules. Forehead but cheek wherever, wherever, um and apparently don't there's nothing, there's no problem with them. But very much like the um the port wine staying birthmark, that cafe A spots are tied to a neurological actually a nerve condition where if you have six or more of these kinds of cafe A birthmarks, UM, especially if they're larger than like a dime in a in an older kid, you want to go to see a doctor because that could mean that you have something called neurofibromatosis. I said that a million times in my head too. You gotta start saying things out loud. Also known as n F one. That's easier, but um n F one is not even necessarily it could It could be asymptomatic. Like if you if you're like, oh my gosh, I've got six or more cafe A birthmarks on me, maybe I have neurofibromatosis um that that's It's not like a death sentence or anything like that. Just go see a doctor. The Mongolian spots are these look like bruises to me. They can if you don't know what you're looking at. It can be alarming because you see these pictures of babies that look like they're heavily bruised kind of at the lower back upper buttocks area, but it is not bruising. Their bluish gray though, and like I said, usually on the lower back. I think um African Americans, African Asian and Hispanic kids usually with darker skin have more of more of them or more more commonly have them, and these are the ones that fade out by the time they're like, you know, six or seven, usually yeah, And they're usually a bluish green because their clusters of pigment cells together deep under the skin. And so you've got that same thing going on with like you have with the um Hey Mangiomas nice I got it. You got it. There's a good old fashioned mole. Uh, this is a pigmented birthmark. Um. Multiple of them are nev, brown, nev, and e v I because the nevus is a single mole. Are any of these like band names? I don't think so, but very fortuitous mentioning of that because of listener mail later. It is Latin for spot and there are three categories. Yes, uh, no, nev I think mole is Latin for spot. Oh is it? Oh? Yeah, wow, I was just about to make fun of you too. I'm glad I didn't. I'm glad you have mole sounds real Latin word. Boy. So there are three categories of moles, congenital, acquired, and atypical. The congenital About one percent of babies are born with these, and these are kind of all over the map as far as color and size. Some remember Harry, some of them are not Harry. I saw that basically every congenital mole has a little hair. Hair of some sort can be very very fine. It can be thick, it can be coarse, it can be very dark. Um. Usually they're very dark because they're growing out of pigment cells that are like just pigment away. Um. And I learned that on the Dollar Shave Club blog. Um. And they say also to just kind of pluck because shaving, if you're a man and like say, you have one on your face or whatever, it can nick very very frequently. Yeah. Well, I've got some of the skin tags that obviously don't shape, so it's not a problem now. But well, maybe that's why you have skin tags. If you shaved, you just shave them off all the time, trim them down. I don't think that's why. Now. The skin tags come from like clothing rubbing against the skin. That's why they're around the neckline a lot of times, or sometimes around the waistline. So you know. But again, those aren't birth marks. Those are old man marks, acquired moles. Uh. They come around later in life as well. Uh. And this is not the same as a skin tag. Still, it is still a male and a lot of doctors think that this is from sun damage, yes, but not necessarily cancerous, which leads us into the third type of mole, a typical moles. These aren't necessarily cancerous either, but they're the kind you definitely want to keep an eye on there. Um. There there will be multiple colors or have some sort of color gradient in them. Their shape will be um, just kind of amorphous, yea, irregular. Yeah, they'll be um just kind of You'll be like that don't look quite right. That's that kind of mole. And those are the kind that you definitely want to have a doctor check out because a lot of people don't know this, but um, an atypical mole is associated with melanoma, and melanoma is no joke. I think a lot of people are like, melan was that thing? Just go, you know, get it removed at the doctor. No, melanoma can spread like lightning through your body and it can be a real problem. It's a very serious thing to to keep up with. Yeah, I've got a pretty sad situation with a family member with melanoma that, um, I think the treatment is going really well, but it is. It has definitely opened my eyes to the fact that it's no joke. Yeah, I had no idea. Um, you may open my eyes. She had somebody that she lost to melanoma. She saw the same thing like melanoma, and no, that's not at all how it is, which is really weird because somebody's dropping the ball because most people just think it's nothing. Yeah on messaging, Yeah, yeah, I agree with myself. Apparently it's interesting that different kinds of cancer have better or worse PR. Yeah, great product, terrible marketing, right, Yeah, it's kind of what we're dealing with here. But I know that, um uh, prostate cancer has often lagged behind breast cancer, like breast cancer does a bang up job of marketing and press and PR and awareness. Um these, like you said, the doctors will want to monitor these over time. What I couldn't figure out was what is the quote unquote beauty mark? Is that an acquired mole? I think a beauty mark is any kind of mole. That's just I'm I'm living with this and and I'm loving every minute. It's so interesting how that has become a thing. I was trying to figure out where it went back to. Obviously, Marilyn Monroe like really kind of popularized, didn't I think it predated her? Like Liz Taylor is at least contemporary, if not predated. Yeah, it's very famous for one. And then like even still it is Cindy Crawford, star Joe um, who else, Oh, Natalie Portman apparently has I'm like on her face. Interesting. I went over this list of celebrity I was like, celebrity birth marks. The only one that comes up though, is moles. Could not I couldn't find any like well known celebrity is with birthmarks like birthmarks, birthmarks like facial birth marks. Yeah, you just I couldn't think of one either. I couldn't find any. Well, that's probably because of the prejudice against them, I would guess, so, yeah, which is sad. Yeah. Um. It reminded me though, Chuck. Didn't one of the Fat Albert gang have a birthmark on his face? Um? I don't know. We was he the guy that had the pulled his toboggan cap over his face? No, I think that was mush mouth because you never see his face at all. Well, then how would you know if he had a birthmark. I don't know. I just thought that might have been a like a backstory or something. I think this just went off the rails enough for um a message break, don't you. Um sure, Yeah, we'll be back right after this and we'll talk about treatment and what I think is a pretty interesting things superstitions throughout history about birthmarks. Greedy. Alright, So, like we said, about most of these birthmarks, usually medical treatment is not necessary, but some are monitored over time, and what doctors will do obviously is examined, examine them, take some pictures, and then just sort of follow that over time that same routine to see if they're changing and to see if they're getting bigger or changing shape or anything unusual. It's a wait and see, yes exactly. Um, if you have hamangioma's, they will UM frequently use like a port wine stain is something that a lot of people go seek treatment for because it's often on the face, the neck right, um, and it actually responds pretty well to a laser treatment, something called the pulse dye laser. Is this like the same tattoo uh treatment or no? Probably because that's pretty painful, right. Oh, yes, Like I can't image because it says children a lot of times can be treated with this laser treatment. But man, I know it's sad. It feels a lot like um, having like a hot bacon grease splashing on your skin. That's what if getting a laser or tattoo remove with the laser, but without the knowledge that like in a couple of minutes, I'm gonna be eating some sweet bacon. More like. The only silver lining too, is that a pig didn't die for you to be in that situation, you know what I mean? Right? Or uh, I won't have whatever tattoo obviously don't want on my body anymore. That's the reward, they're right. So if that is the case, then if it is the same feeling as that, then yeah, I feel bad for little kids who get that. But that's the best time to start this treatment is when the child is young, because again, what you're what you're doing is you're using a pulse die laser, which uses a certain frequency or spectrum wavelength of light that is targeted so that that birthmark will absorb that light. The surrounding skin is a different pigment, so it won't absorb that light like the birthmark. Well, and that energy, that light energy is translated into heat energy in the birthmark, and there go the cells or the blood vessels that make up the cells. And after enough treatments, you've hopefully broken up the hamangioma or the port wine stain um and like the birthmark will go away. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? That was me? I think that was me? Now that was mine. Well, then we just had a simultaneous stomach growl because my stomach just growled at the same time. Are we like after after twelve years of podcasting together. So if you are getting something removed, it's usually a vascular birthmark. Um. Generally they don't try and get rid of pigmented birth marks, although it's possible, I think, but usually doctors don't treat that. No, but if you if you have a child with say a cafe ol a birthmark on their on their face, the doctor is not going to be like, no, we're not doing that. They'll they'll probably try to work it out, but the results are not nearly as reliable as with vascular birth marks, which have to do with um blood vessels beneath the skin clustered together, overdeveloped, that kind of thing, or what your doctor might say is, um, you know what this thing is on your forehead, Grow your bangs out until you get old enough to where you accept this as like an individual trait that you're proud of. There's a there's something called the British Association of Skin Camouflage that is dedicated to helping people actually training makeup artists on how to cover birthmarks because for some people they'll just never get used to it. They don't want to have to get used to it. They just rather cover it up. And that's their right, that's the prerogative. That's their birthmark. They can do whatever they want with it. And so the average makeup artist doesn't know how to do that. It actually takes special skills apparently, and so there's groups who train people are interesting to do that. We should do I don't. I don't know if it's a short stuff for full length, but we should do something on vida igo. Uh. I had a friend in l a who, um, who had videl igo. And again, like the same with some of this stuff. It's such a forward facing thing if it's on your face, and it's a big deal to people, it's an important, um, it's important issue because like the bullying, like we were talking about, we're just kids and adults remaining self conscious about that kind of thing. It's it's sad, it is sad. I agreed. I think we could all do a lot better at accepting people with facial differences. What it's called. There's something on facial differences. I don't remember what it was, but I know I've mentioned this group before, changing Faces dot Org. It's awesome. They're just there. Their whole thing is like, hey, actually it's funny they um are they promote skin campus if you want it. But they're also they're big pushes like hey, rest of society, Like there's nothing different about these people except for their face. Like they're not cognitively challenged. They're not. They're not disabled in any way or differently able. Like their face is different for any number of reasons, and it's really kind of on the rest of you to get over it, you know, which I think is the healthiest approach if you ask me. So the superstitions we were talking about, I know we mentioned a couple early on, um, like that you were touched by the devil, like that was real stuff. In some cultures, uh, in China, there were some quirky ones like if you have a right foot birthmark means you're adventurous. It's on the left foot, it means you're really smart. If it's on your tom toms, that means you're greedy. And this is just sort of you know, culture and folklore sure, um, the world around. So because we can't explain what birthmarks or where they come from. All over the world, people societies have said it's something the mom did while she was pregnant. Course, and so we came up with all sorts of dipstick ideas for exactly what the mom did wrong to explain birthmarks. One of my favorites is that the mom was startled and touched her face, and at the exact same moment, the baby's blood vessels at that point in the baby's face formed of birthmark. It's very scientific. Or how about this, If you have a strawberry mark as a baby, it's because mom ate too many red things or can't play off the strawberry or port wine staying they couldn't laugh off the wine. Yeah, or coffee cafe a coffee that's so on the nose, Like, come on, people, it is. There's this thing called the doctrine of signs, where like if a food looked like um a body part, it was associated with helping to heal that body part, like beats um are good for the for the blood or something like that, or avocados are good for the testicles. Exactly. I was hoping you would bring that up. Uh, let me see what else um In Japan if um, a pregnant woman looked at a fire or into a flame of some kind, they thought that might cause a burn mark on the baby skin. Yep. And I think some of these carry forward a little bit even today. Well, the X ray one is obviously fairly modern. Oh sure. Like the explanation is that the mom got an X ray while she was pregnant. In it, it basically left a mark on the baby. Yeah, that's not true. That is not true. No. Um. The one that really is always stuck out to me, and it reminded me of this case I want to tell you about. Um is this idea that a birthmark is actually a mark left over from a past life. This is pretty neat, Like if you have a birthmark that looks like a bullet hole in your back, that means you were shot in the back right in the past life, and not just like that's what that means. Like there there are I really hesitate the uses where they're documented cases of this of this happening. Supposedly, there was this kid in Syria, UM who was born with like a kind of like a slash like birthmark I think, on the back of his head, and apparently from a very early age, when the kid like was able to start to talk, started recounting being murdered with an axe and then started talking about the village where he used to live and who is what his name was, and then the guy that killed him, and it was enough allegedly that the village elders where this kid lived were like, we need to go check this out. So they traveled to that other village and they said, does so and so live here? And they're like, yeah, he lives over there. And it's like, well, did you did somebody else name this live here? Once they're like, yes, he died, he vanished mysteriously, and they went and talked to They went and talked to the accuser. Um he broke down and confessed and showed him where they buried the body that this kid supposedly was in the past life who was murdered by an X. There's just no way that that happened. But I love reading about stuff like that. The part of me that's like that subscribed to that time life books of like Paranormal Phenomena still loves stories like that. Yeah, I think you lost me when you said village elders. Oh yeah, yeah, because you know they're the same ones that are like, well you're a witch because yeah, see if you see if she floats right, So what else you got any others? Let me see here, Well, we talked about the devil's mark. Uh, supposedly amb Boleyn was accused of witch crafty crafty supposedly. I saw also that she most decidedly was not. Yeah, I think that's the legend all right, possession by the devil. It could be another one. And one thing that we did know was, um, that definitely did happen historically from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. If you were Russian nobility, you proved it by displaying your birth mark. Yeah, I guess so yeah, Um, what's the what was the family of the romanofs pretty interesting? Which actually holds water because they think that some birthmarks may be congenital. It's entirely possible that a family line, especially one that kind of kept in themselves, you know what I mean, could conceivably pass down something like a birthmark. Yeah, and so uh, unless you do you have anything else, No, I don't chuck take it away. I think we just should close by really like stressing to any kids listening and parents of children that vascular birth marks have to do with blood vessels. No, just explain to your kids if there's another kid in their class, as you know, a pretty obvious birthmark, that they're just the same. And don't don't tease kids for that stuff. If you're a kid that's young and listening, we all look different, we all have different skin tones. Yeah, just don't be a jerk. No, I think that's really great advice. Now, I think the golden rule. Think about how you might feel if somebody was making fun of something about your body. That's a good one too. Yeah. Uh, if you want to know more about parenting, while you could just listen to all of our other episodes. And since I said that, it's time for listener mail. Uh. This is from Ryan and Lucy, the aforementioned band name ref Uh. They have been to our shows at the Bellhouse a couple of times, a few times and uh, let me see where are they from here? Road trips between New York and Providence. And then they've seen us at the Bell House and they said, we realize how much we get a kick out of the various band names. And we started to inventory them a few years ago since our wedding is next week, we realize that now it's a perfect time UM to just go ahead and send you the list. I'm not sure why that has anything to do anything, but Ryan and Lucy congratulations. Yea, for what it's worth. Ryan's favorite a is worm burden. Oh yeah, from Hookworm and Lucy's mouth parts. Yeah, that's from a lot of episodes. But we'll just buzz through these really quickly, just for nostalgis sake and aspiring bands jump in and take these and give us some money for him. There's some real gold in here. Are we doing all those? Yeah? Oh my god, that's right. I'll go through them quickly. Fistful of neurons, warm burden, tub of pulp. I know you want to comment on everyone, just throw in what you think is really good gon here like threat simulation theory, poor fred noon in. I remember that one, Uh, sweet, give me the teat. I don't remember that one. It was from Uncanny Valley, but I don't remember saying that was a band or even how it would relate to it. This is from movie Crush Sick Vandalism. That's a good one. Flesh on the chunks, hot plastic, injection, pyrocastic flow. That's a good one. Flaming death, death bolts, pantos that is a legendary one. Conceptual walls framing him cohort offspring, cohort, omni cohort, third generation cohort offspring, spousal cohort. I don't remember any of those. All those were from that heart study. Okay, uh oh, that's right. Cortical homunculous, that's pretty good, medieval synthesis, magic bullet. I want to retract this next one because apparently I said herbal Douches was a good band name. I take that back. That's terrible. Uh. Slaughtered narwhal peck lube, sex linked recessive manhole incidents. That's a good one. Graphic spew, gross nuclear bulge, love it, local group. That's kind of dumb. Oh no, I can see it, kind of like scrantnicity. Oh sure, the Electric Death Commission. I love that one. Dr Foss bomb drop What was that one? Michael Dillon Huh, I don't remember exactly what that referenced death master file mouth part uh the of course, the classic frozen poop knife, sloth moths, radioactive cats, that one's dumb. Static Crush. I like that one. Damage Knight not bad. The descriptive ists that's a little haughty, I think, but I could be kind of like Mumford and Sonsie kind of music, right, Yeah, exactly, it sounds too much like Decembrists. I think that is exactly right. Bathtub Gin Wasted on Excitement. That's an album title, he says, But that's pretty good as a band. Mother Culture, Jungle x Ray very recent, uh wet record the album from Jungle x Ray to Whale Bolt from Corduroy and then going Postal, which he says is a lot of bands are called that. Yeah, I think you looked that up even into it. I think, so those are good. We always always, any time we talk about great band names from episodes, have to give a shout out, especially when Frozen Poop Knife comes up to Diarrhya Planet. Well, he had that on the list. I think he didn't quite understand that that is a real band. That is a real band that pre dates Frozen Proof Knife. I know. I'd like to think that they've been tweeted at over the years. Oh they've tweeted to us. Oh that's right, they have right, they said, Um, they said, hey, sorry, we're gonna stick with our Thanks for thinking of it. In other words, shut up. Maybe I don't know. I think it depends on how you look at the world. Okay, so I think that's it everybody. I don't remember what's going on anymore. But this is the end of the episode.
