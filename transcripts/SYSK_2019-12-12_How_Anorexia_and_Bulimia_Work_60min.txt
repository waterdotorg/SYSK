Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles w Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry over there. Um, and it's just nice and pleasant, isn't it? Chuck and Jerry? I mean it smells in here? Is that what you're referencing? Yeah, gamey, I think, Yeah, how about this. We won't say who was in here just before us, but it was three men from our office. And the room smells a little gamy, a little musky. It's warm, and Jerry's headphones are hot, and her chair's lot and she's so creeped out, yeah, getting a little sweaty. Yeah. So, um, that's the last joke I'm gonna tell for this episode. By the way. You know, every time we say that, we end up like making jokes. So yeah, let's say it. Yes, this is going to be a very serious episode and there will be no jokes whatsoever. All right, hopefully we can work in a funnier two that is clearly not at anyone's expense. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's gotta be organic, it's gotta be good, it's gotta be worth it, I guess, is what I'm trying to say, and about each other. Right. So, um, we're talking today, Chuck about anorexia and bulimia, known in the slang as anna and mia. Did you know that? I did not know that. Yeah, And um, they are actually very closely related eating disorders, so much so that if you went to the big Book of Eating disorders, the d s M five, and you said, ds M five, tell me what is the difference between anna and mia, the d s M five would just kind of shrug me, like, I don't know, man, we we are, We're not a sure. There are some big differences, but they are clearly connected to some underlying degree. Yeah, I mean you know they define anorexia as restrictive restrictive as in really restrictive, severely limited intake of food. Um, and binging and purging, which is if you don't know what that term is, that means eating and then vomiting afterward, are using laxatives to get that poop going really quickly. Uh. That is also under anorexia in the d s M five. But that's also binging and purging obviously characteristic of bolimia, which is has its own categorytion, so categorization. So it's a little um, I guess confusing is the best way to say it, right, right, So I looked into a little more and it looks like anorexia. Like you were saying, is is the hallmark of it is calorie restriction. But apparently some people who suffer from anorexia every once in a while binge and purge, so it can include that. Okay, yes, but bolimia doesn't necessarily involve any sort of even like weight component um, and it doesn't ut any kind of calorie restriction. It is strictly binging and purging. So you've got these two different things, but they're both related in that your relationship with food is just not healthy in any way, shape or form. And the other thing that really kind of ties the two things together is that they're based on a disturbed body image where you look in the mirror and what you see doesn't reflect reality at all. You might see yourself as maybe normal if it's on a good day, you probably more often than not see yourself as overweight, fat, gross, disgusting, any number of horrible things you can say about yourself, where if someone else is looking at you, they would be like, Wow, this person really needs to eat fast because they're emaciated their skin and bones. But the aner and arexia patient or believe me, a patient does not see that at all. And so that kind of continues the cycle of either calorie restriction or binging and purging. But they're they're both after the same goal essentially, right and included. And we're going to talk a lot about the symptoms and behaviors of people that suffer from both of these. But a lot of scale work. Weighing yourself a lot sometimes, you know, multiple times during a day, obsessing over like you know, half pounds I saw, like we're digital scales are really sort of a culprit, and you know, obsessing over like a tenth of a pound and eighth of a pound, um, being really upset over the gaining of any weight, even if it's just a half a pound, let's say. Uh. And like you said, the language around food and body and self image is really important, um, because this can often be one of the early indicators or just an indicator for friends and family if you listen to how people talk, because a lot, you know, most of the stuff is done behind closed doors, and one of the big components, one of the sad components is is staying in a lot and not eating out with people and keeping all that very private. So the words are really really important here, Yeah, because I mean, if you have anorexia and you're engaging in like severe calorie restriction, you know that doesn't just stop when you go out with friends. It's like it is a part of you. I've seen a uh described akin to a relationship, like a very intense obsessive relationship where the patient and this disorder are super tight. It's like their life, right. So if you're out and you're hanging out with friends and trying to appear normal, there's all sorts of stuff you have to do to make it look like you've eaten, hiding food, offering other people food, um, trying to make a big deal about you know what you did eat, like really showing everybody look I ate this. Um. Just just engaging in kind of some obvious and bizarre behavior, and that's exhausting. So it's kind of like what you said that ultimately results in the person just withdrawing from social activities because it's not worth like keeping up appearances. Yeah, and as far as beliemia goes uh you know, intentionally vomiting after a meal. Um. One of the hallmarks is excuse in yourself very quickly after a meal. And that's if you are over the social component you are actually eating out with friends or family. Uh. And then those laxatives taking you know, unhealthy doses of laxatives, laxatives to induce diarrhea as quickly as possible, um, and some other stuff you know, uh, trying to sweat off additional weight. Um. You know, wearing like a plastic suit and sitting in a sauna, like really extreme measures or just excessive exercise to try and get rid of the extra weight. Right. So, so what you have then is somebody who is convinced that they're overweight, first of all, even when they're not, and secondly, is obsessed with the idea of getting rid of that additional weight. Um. And they do it by engaging in unhealthy behaviors with food. And depending on how they do it, you've got anorexia or you have bulimia. And UM. There's some symptoms, some of which we kind of just went over, but some are are kind of obvious. UM. Some are red flags. UM. You know, like if somebody starts to become very thin to where you can see their bones. Um, that's a big sign that they have anorexia, but they you know, you can have anorexia and not ever necessarily become emaciated. UM. I think the diagnosis, as far as the American Psychological Association is concerned, is if you if a patient comes to you and they weigh fifteen percent less than their normal weight for their heightened age, you would be able to diagnose them with anorexia, or at the very least you should start asking them questions about whether or not they have anorexia. Yeah, and blieve me, is very complex too, because there's not one pattern. It's not it's not always just binge and purge every day, although it can mean that sometimes if you suffer from bolimia, you will eat um. You won't bench, You'll just eat normal meals and then purge those. Uh. Sometimes you will restrict eating um, just sort of as a rule. But then occasionally you will binge and then purge, like eat you know, a huge enormous meal, which you know bene eating is a is a whole different eating disorder that you know. All of these are sort of related and have some overlap, but I think for this uh, this show, we're just gonna kind of concentrate on anorexia and bolimia, right yeah, yeah, benj any disorder. I think it deserves its own thing because it's so prevalent and so many people have it and don't even realize it, which I suspect has to do with the food supply. I think we've been inadvertently, um addicted to food. Um have you I told you about that that book, The Dorrito Effect, right, yeah, yeah, Well, like in the premise of it is that, like, to feed this many people, we've had to basically create frankin foods and to make them taste good, we've had to use these different additives and artificial flavors and colors and all this stuff. And the kind of idea behind it is that in doing this, we've accidentally created these things that are super addictive, and people have become addicted to foodis is a very common thing. Whether it was intentional or unintentional. At this point, it doesn't really matter. People are just addicted to terrible food that's really bad for them. Yeah. So as far as the symptoms go, you know, if we talked about some of them. Uh, you know, the obvious ones that you could as a friend or family member maybe notice, as far as the exercise, not eating in public and stuff like that, the preoccupation with weight. But um physically, you know, you you can lead the things like brittle hair, um, difficulty thinking, fainting and passing out. Uh. And that's you know, stuff that people might notice in public. Uh. Something that they may not see on the inside is anemia, uh, chronic fatigue, constipation, um, slowed pulse. Uh. And then I hadn't heard of this. The growth of fine hair on the body that lanugo that the newborn babies is one of the most adorable little things, this little on a baby. Yeah, Supposedly there's some waxy substance that covers the baby in the womb and prevents them from getting chapped and chafed by the amniotic fluid, and that lanugo hair kind of grows in like this, this kind of downy fine fur that lets that waxy substance stick to the skin. And again, if you if you become malnourished, it triggers lenugo to grow like later on in life. Yeah, that's a that's a big sign. Another one is um a manorrhea, which is the absence of um menstruation or menstrual periods. Right, And that used to be like even I knew that as like a sixth grade boy or something back in the eighties, like that was like a huge thing. If if a girl didn't have a period, I meant she had anorexia. And apparently the d s M five, the latest version, said now we're going to take that up because it's not the case without everybody like, yes, it definitely can lead to that. And if you have a manorrhea, there's a possibility it's from anorexia. But if you have anorexia, it doesn't mean you're going to um stop having your period. Yeah, absolutely um. And you know, I wonder how many like fourteen year old girls listening to this we just lost because I said period twice. Hopefully there hanging there is exactly who should be listening to the show. And if we're talking about girls and women more, uh, and we'll get to the stats. They suffer from anorexi and believe me in more than men do. But that is not to say that men don't suffer from it, and they absolutely do. Um. I mean I might as well go with a few of these. Have some other statistics. I found at least thirty million people of all ages and genders suffer from eating disorder in the United States. And that's all eating disorders. Every sixty two minutes, at least one person dies as a direct result from an eating disord. Um the A few of these are just so sad. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness period. Thirteen percent of women over the age of fifty engage in eating disorder behaviors. I saw three and a half percent can have UM like or have a diagnosable eating disorder three and a half over the age of fifty or forty. And that that midlife eating disorder thing is like a big and growing problem right now. Yeah, I mean, well, you know, we talked about adolescents a lot in here, but it's not something restricted to uh two young people. Um, this one is super sad as well. Six of transgender college students have reported and eating disorder. Uh boy, these are so sad to read out loud. Um of the risk for either one is genetic. Uh. And we'll talk about the genetics of it a little later too, And then more and half of bolimia patients have comorbid anxiety disorders. Yeah, I saw that too. It was like I saw something like fifty of people with anorexia have I think anxiety, and like percent or something of people with bolimia have have anxiety disorder. Yeah, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, substance abuse disorders. It says usually alcohol. It's one in ten boliemia patients. So it's just, you know, these are the worst kind of statistics to read off, but it's important to know that it's it's across the gender spectrum, across the age spectrum. Uh. If you think that it's just something teenage girls go through, that's just not the case. Yeah, and not just teenage girls. For a long time, it was a teenage white girl problem. And they're starting to realize, like, no, this is it was like you were saying, like it it spans ethnicities, genders, nationalities, ages, it's it's a much bigger problem than than we used to think. And I don't know if it's become a bigger problem or if just under awareness and understanding of it has grown or something like that. But did you mention suicide. I don't think I did, so you were saying that this is this is one of the reasons we're talking about this um. Anorexia and bolimia are one of the maybe the deadliest mental disorder there is as far as statistics go, like you were saying, and one of the big reasons is because so many people with anorexia or blieve me to die by suicide something like two hundred times at a two hundred times greater rate than the general population. Says here, one in five of anorexia deaths is by suicide. And then if it's not by suicide, there's a host of other ways that you can die from anorexia. You can simply starve to death, where your your you um, your heart can stop, your organs can shut down, and it's from this lack of energy that you're putting into your body. Your your body's organs start to um kind of slow down, to metabolize more slowly, to kind of conserve what little energy they do have, and eventually it just doesn't work any longer. Your body stops basically, and you can die just from not eating and not because there wasn't any food. There was plenty of food and everyone who was around you wanted you to eat, you just wouldn't do it because you felt fat. Yeah, And I don't even think it's a lot of times a matter of if. I mean, if you don't get treated and you don't get help and it gets bad enough, then you will die from oregon failure at some point. Yes, But we have to say we don't want to get all like horribly grim, because there are studies that are coming out now that are saying, actually, we've been studying these people for like twenty five years, and we're finding that over the long haul, you can cure anorexia for good. It just takes a while. And it also, from what I've seen, takes a patient who wants to be cured absolutely. Uh. And then one more thing here, if we do need to talk about puberty and adolescence because it can have really um long lasting effects if that's the time of your life where this is happening, long term effects on your development, um on your growth. Uh. If you I think it says if you have anorexia beginning at age ten all the way through your twenties, you can have permanent stunted growth. You can ever do sex secondary sexual characteristics like um, your pubic care, won't grow in your breast won't develop. Uh. And maybe a lack of menstruation from the beginning, not like the cessation of menstruation, Like you may never get your period right and you may be infertile as a matter of fact as an adult. That's right. So yeah, just because of the age that it's the um, the age that it sets on, I guess, um, it's such an important time for the development your body. It's like the last time you should be like time, I'm just not gonna eat for a couple of days. Yeah. Um. It has some real sweeping effects for sure. Yeah. And bulimia too, for for its part, UH is really rough on the teeth, um, yellowing, decaying teeth, sensitive teeth, UH, swollen sore throat, acid reflux like all the time. Um. And then you know electrolyte imbalances being in the bathroom a lot because you're you're you're tricking your body essentially into thinking is getting some nutrition and then getting rid of that food really quickly, and that nutrition really quickly. Uh. And that can lead to you know, fainting, fatigue, and eventually heart attacks and strokes. Serious stuff. Yeah, it is extraordinarily serious stuff, and a lot of people are like, well, it's just you know, this is how my daughter, my sister, my friend likes to look. She likes to be skinny. And this is a really persistent problem with dealing with anorex he is that. Um, I've seen it multiple places. It's not a lifestyle, it's a mental health disorder, and it has to be treated because again, it is, statistically speaking, the deadliest mental health disorder there is. Should we take a break, Yes, we're gonna take a break, and we're gonna come back with a whole list of jokes. That's right, Okay, Chuck lay us the first joke on us. All right, I have no jokes, although I will say, uh, I think were it's time for a great sidebar. Um. You know, we we got one of those uh home I'm not gonna buzz market anyone, but one of those home units that you speak to and it tells you the weather and stuff, like one of those robots. Yeah, like a little robot you put. I've been testing it out with my daughter lately, and those robots that talk to you can tell jokes. Did you know that? Yes? I did, and they some of them are kind of funny, and they're all kind of great for four year olds. Well what you got, oh, I mean none of I mean some Thanksgiving jokes around this time, and they I think they try to be topical topical jokes. So there's like Christmas and Thanksgiving jokes going on right now. But you're not going to tell us one of the I'm trying to remember some of them. I mean, trust me, they're they're not great jokes for adults, but four year olds eat it up. It's they're probably like deeply copyrighted too. Maybe I don't know if you can copyright these kind of dumb jokes. Thanksgiving joke, you're kidding me. It's like what our country has founded on, all right, but writing Thanksgiving. So that that's been going on at our house is a lot of joke telling. And they can make Bourbon noises and two noises and it's uh, I'm trying to test the limits of how blue they can go. Remember that little handheld box we had that would make different like fart sounds and sharking sounds. So basically this is what this is is a high tech kind of robot butler that makes fart sounds. Yeah, it's great. Is it on wheels? Now, it's not on wheels, it's it's it sits on your nightstand or wherever you want it. I got you, so all right, enough, enough fun and games. Yeah, we should talk a little bit about the causes of anorexia, because this is one of the more confounding. Um well, I mean a lot of mental health disorders are confounding in this way, actually, but we don't know the cause of it. Um. It is probably a lot of causes. Um. Some of them may conflict with one another, but it is probably a very complex bag and mix of societal pressures, which we're gonna talk about your environment, and then genetics look like they do play a part. Yeah. They they think that it's a this get this man, this is what they call a grab bag catch all. That there is a bio psycho social mechanism underlying anorexia and bolimia. Yeah, it's biological, psychological, and social. And they're probably right. I mean, there's probably components of all of them put together there, which would explain why it's so hard to understand at this point and so hard to treat. It's very tough because it's not like you can point to one thing and say, correct this part of your life, and uh yeah, and it'll be better. It's like it's there's so many prongs. It's really really tough. Yeah, absolutely, because let me think about it, Like if you have a person who has uh anorexia and they want to get better, but the reason that they developed anna rixie in the first place is because they have a parent who's on them about their weight all the time. You have to correct the parents behavior in addition to, you know, possibly treating the patient in the hospital for malnourishment. Like, it is a big complex ball of stuff, but there are there are studies that have kind of turned up like little little bits here. They're like, oh, here's a here's a little a little I don't know, like a hot a matchbox car or something. In a pile of rocks means what's something you want? Like a diamond in the basically, Okay, I haven't you ever found a match box kind of pil of rocks. But like, I was really glad that I found this. I thought it was just some dumb, boring pile of rocks. I've never I had no idea where you're going there. Well, but I'm glad, we gotta laugh out of this. I was being serious. Oh sorry, um, are you talking about the study the twin study, I'm talking about all the studies. Okay, Well, they did do a twin study, and they found as in studying human twins, not two different studies that look alike. But uh, they found that if and this is this is sort of helps back up evidence of a genetic component. But if one twin has anorexia, then they're identical twin, not fraternal um um more likely to also have that same disorder. Right, But not, like you said, among fraternal twins, because so because I mean you'd think, like, you know, you see identical twins and and think like what did your mother do to you too? How? How could this be allowed to go on? But if that's not the case with fraternal twins, then that removes that environmental component, strongly suggests that it's a genetic component. Yeah, and maybe to some degree a social component. I mean not all the time, but I would imagine fraternal twins are generally um subjected to this or similar social components. Yes. The only thing that would confound that is fraternal twins can also be like like boy and girl So I mean if the if they tossed out the boy and girl and just had like fraternal twin girls or fraternal twin boys in study, I would say that would strongly suggest it's a genetic component. But I mean, in in any home, a boy and a girl are going to be treating or a son and a daughter is going to be treated differently. Is just the way it is, unless you live in a skinner box. Oh gosh, that that should lighten the mood, right, unless you're dad shocks you for studies at home. Uh, they did not have not found a gene they can pinpoint. They have found thirty I'm sorry, forty three genes that could potentially be of use when it comes to linking genetics to these disorders, but they haven't. It's nothing is very clear cut at this point. Right. So that's the that's about as far as they've gotten on the biological component. UM. As far as the psychological component, like you were saying, they found there's a lot of comorbidity with other UM. Other behavior disorders and personality disorders like depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder UM. They bear a lot of resemblance to one another and that um, like with with anorexia or bulimia, something called ritualized food behaviors develop where um, you cut food into small pieces first to make it seem like there's more or make it seem like you are, um are like eating more than you actually are. But the what makes it ritualizes you couldn't eat food any their way, or you have to arrange food a certain way on the plate before you eat it, or even like religiously counting and tracking calories is considered a ritualized food behavior, and it really kind of trapes is into the realm of something like obsessive compulsive disorder or experience the anxiety if you're forced to eat food on a plate that's not arranged in the way that you're used to. So the idea is that you eat one english pi at a time, you are you are taking a lot of bites and therefore, hey, look I'm eating a lot. Yeah, that's kind of more deceptive behavior and that would probably be like a two fer something. I mean self deceptive even you know, sure, sure, but also deceptive like your parents who might be watching you like a hawk or something. You're like, no, no, exactly, really interesting. But if you couldn't eat peas any other way but that then that would be a ritualized food behavior. Right. Uh, this statistic as far as meeting criteria for at least one other mental health disorder, it's fifty of anorexia patients and for bolimia. Yeah, that is really high. Yeah, and that's and you know, that's what makes it weird that the two are so overlapped, because so you've got anorexia nervosa and bolimia nervosa, and again they each have their own separate entries in the d s M. But then there's a kind of a binge and purge bolimia component to anorexia. But the personality disorders that are even the types of personalities that engage in each one are really really different. Like with anorexia nervosa UM, the patients are usually low novelty seeking, so they're not like trying out new things. They have a low emotional responsiveness, decreased pleasure, and reduce social spontaneity. That's typical someone with anorexia nervosa. With bolimia nervosa, it's like kind of the opposite. They tend to be impulsive, they look for new experiences, and they can have characteristics of a borderline personality disorder from whatever read So they're like two totally different types of people but engage in the same behavior. And it's one of those things where it's like, Okay, if you have two different types of people who are trying to do the same thing or trying to achieve the same end, what you know, what commonalities do they have? In exploring those commonalities, maybe we'll find like the answers to what causes eating disorders like this. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean it does make a little bit of sense when you look at the you know, like someone suffering from anorexia would avoid going out to eat spontaneously with friends, let's say at all costs. Someone with bulimia might jump right in there because in their mind they they may think that they have a solve for that behavior, which is I'll excuse myself to the bathroom right afterward, and I can still go out with my friends and eat a regular sized meal. I think that's a really good point. So either way that the regardless of how that person is personality wise, they're going to age in trying to maintain their weight. But depending on their type of personality, they're going to choose this route or that route. Yeah, yeah, I think I think you're onto something. Dr Chuck. Well, the other thing too, is with these personality traits, they found correlation with things like perfectionism, irritability, and like you were talking about this, sometimes being impulse over, sometimes the opposite. But what they found too is, uh, you know, if you're studying adolescence in puberty, a lot of these are normal traits of adolescence, so it's really hard to distinguish sometimes and a lot of times these things it's a chicken or the egg, these are caused by the eating disorder and not the other way around. Yeah. That also applies to differences in brain structure too, Like they found things like um reduction in the gray matter and the white matter in the brain of people with one of the nervosas or um they have more cerebral spinal fluid, and then other regions of the brain are smaller compared to people who don't have disorders, but they clear up when the um anorexia is successfully treated. Yeah, so that's it's kind of it really makes you wonder like where, you know, did it cause it or its like it doesn't. It doesn't prove or disprove it either way. It's just the two are related and we're not sure which causes which. Yeah. I thought this F m R I stuff was interesting because you know, our motto went in doubt, go into the wonder machine and see what's lighting up. Be very instructive. And they did the longest motto, every t you can fit on the front end, back of a T shirt, not a hat, kind of peters out down the bottom, that's right. Uh. And then the script just you know, like a pen like you fall asleep all writings, right, yeah, right, So the F m R I Wonder machine has found that, uh, it lights up those reward centers in the brain show increased activity. Um, if you have intorexy and you're shown photos of someone who is drastically underweight, So that's a pretty obvious you know sign right there. Another one is noticing fine details when you are shown a picture of your own face, that that reward response is just lighting up the reward center. So that that means that they are are hyper um aware of their appearance at all times for sure, and like they noticed things that might not even be there, right Um. And then finally you get to the social part of the biopsychosocial components. UM and that's the environmental factors. And one of the big ones that has kind of emerged is the idea of sexual abuse in creating antirects the universear starting it in in UM people. I saw that. I think John's Hawkins said sexual abuse has been reported in twenty of individuals with antorexts inniversa and bolimia innivosa, right, um, And it doesn't necessarily have to just be sexual abuse, but there is a consistent UM reporting of some sort of trigger. Like the people who have bolimia and anorexia typically can point to the moment that it started or the thing that created this idea in their mind. It could be apparent being overly critical of their weight. It oftentimes as a parent, I think, yeah, it could be a coach who is overly critical of their weight. Um. It can be a bully teasing them about their way. It could be a friend making a joke about their way. It just depends on the moment, you know how, like how something can bother you but it doesn't seem to bother anybody else um and vice versa. You know something that bothers someone else. You're like, that's not that big of a deal. But it's all just based on the person, in the context, in the setting, and maybe even just that perfect combination of neurotransmitters that happened to be active in their brain right then then just something got them just right that has been on to kickstart an xi and bolimia under a lot of circumstances. Yeah, and it's just for parents. It's so important how they talk about UH and not just to their kids, but any time your kid can hear you speaking words, how you talk about weight, and how you talk about your own body, and how you talk about health and um, you know, having a kid now, it's just it's made me realize how unkind I can be to my own self being overweight, and you you can't say those things in front of a four year old. You have to talk about um health and you know, daddy's exercising because daddy wants to be healthier and stuff like that, because you'd be surprised that you know, these little ears they hear it all. And um, the last thing that you want is for anything that you say to be UH two to have an impact on your child, uh in an unhealthy way about their body image. You know, it's just super super important, and I think it's gotten much much better than than the old days when you know, I know a lot of women who talk about, you know, whether or not they suffered from anorexi or not, uh, struggling with their body image because um, most of the time mom talking about it growing up. I'm sure Dad's played part two. But I've heard a lot of anecdotal examples of women talking about in this, you know, in the seventies, mom talking about, you know, you can't eat this, you can't eat that because you won't get a boyfriend, or this won't happen or that won't happen, right, and um, that's yeah. I've seen that a lot of places too for researching this. But one of the other things I saw is like what you were saying where you were talking about yourself. You have to watch what you say around your daughter. When you say disparaging things about your yourself, that's called fat talk. And it is like a pastime in the West, were like getting getting together with friends or just having a couple of conver station around the water cooler or something about how fat you are or how much you ate and how much you you need to lose weight, and that they found it can actually be a real driver for leading to um eating disorders as well. Yeah, I mean I make jokes all the time about that with you and everyone I know, but I don't use that word in my house. Uh. I have to stop myself from making jokes about myself. It's just it's no good for anyone. Know. One question I have though, is like I was a pretty like husky boy. You were robust. I was very like I had the Pillsbury doughboy nickname, and like I mean like I was the fat in class for sure, And uh it bothered me, like really set the tone of my childhood in a lot of ways. Like I had a really great childhood and I loved it, but I also had like a real bummer childhood in that sense too. Um But like, what do you do when your kid is demonstrably overweight and needs to lose weight or else they're going to spend the rest of their life uggling with their weight, which is not fun at all? Like what do you do? How do you approach the little fragile ego of a kid and saying we need to get some weight off you, you know, without leading them down this path to an eating disorder. That's got to be one of the trickiest things you you would ever have to to talk about with your kid in that in that situation. Yeah, and and also especially now in a day where there's such a movement to be accepting of who you are, no matter how what size you are. Um, it's just such a fine line to walk between good health and accepting who you are. Like, I don't necessarily have a super poor self image, but I want to be alive in thirty years for my daughter, you know, right, sure, like the vanity is kind of gone at this point. I'm for but I want to be healthy. Uh and and those you know, a healthy weight goes hand in hand with not having the stroke in the heart attack later on exactly. But I think a lot of people would say, like, Okay, yes, there is health to be gained from eating better or from exercising or doing both ideally. Um, but one of the problems that we have is this ideal where it's like, well, keep going until you have washboard abs, and until you have like these amazing biceps, and until you just want to do nothing but walk around in nospedo or something like that. And the fact that like those are the models that we see on the billboards, that drives even that idea of health, healthiness to this kind of perverted, weird place that can kind of develop eating disorders as well. Yeah, that's not me. I have no illusions about ever having a washboard stomach. I've given up on this. I don't want a washboard's stomach. I want to want to see, just to see what it's like, and then I'd be like, all right, give me a donna. I like a little softness to a body. It's nicer I hug on and lay around with. I don't want I do too. I mean, Emily didn't want to put her head down on a washboard stomach, right, she doesn't want to bounce a nickel off of the No, So I want I want to see what it would look like on me, and then that'd be fine. I mean, that's it. I don't really have like any it's not my ideal look or anything like that. I just want to see if I could ever do it. Yeah, I just I just need to get healthier and drop some weight and you know, feel a little bit better day to day, like moving around the world, because it has an impact on that stuff too. That's the key is feeling better day to day, feeling good in your clothes, feeling to the point where you're not thinking about what you're eating or how much you're exercising because you're getting enough. That's the key right there, that's the goal. Yeah, So let's talk about social pressure because that's kind of we're right in the middle of it. Um well, actually, let's take a break. Okay, I'm gonna go do some crunches, right, I'm gonna hold your feet down, and we're gonna we're gonna talk about social pressure right for this, So Chuck, those were pretty good. Crunches bad, not bad at all. I'm gonna go with a B plus. You know I started seeing a trainer, did you really? Yeah, well that's pretty cool, man. I didn't know that. So, like about a month then like like kind of cool and supportive or like drill instructor type, like army. Well she has former army funny enough, but she is cool and supportive and more than anything, it's just like I gotta show up at her house three days a week and do it and I can't. You know, I can't not do it. And that's I am one person who will not do it if given any opportunity to not do it. Yeah, it's so easy to just shirk on that kind of stuff and just you know, there's always reasons to not go or not do it or whatever. But if you have somebody there then like, you know, motivating you, that definitely helps. YEA, Thanks, good for you, man. Thanks dude. It's she's killing me, she's kicking my butt, but it's it's what I need right now. So one of those two, admittedly throwing it out there, I'll give you a number. Michelle, She's great. So, uh, social pressures we're talking about, Uh, you know, this is from a Western point of view here in the United States, uh, Canada, some places in Europe, although that can vary pretty pretty greatly on how they look at their bodies there, but definitely in the United States, our culture has demonstrably said loud and clear thin as in, you've got to be skinny, whether it's TV or advertising or Instagram now or YouTube. Um, it's starting to change a little bit more because there's there's another whole wave that I was talking about about accepting your accepting yourself and being happy with whatever side you are. But that still can't counter the onslaught that has happened for decades and decades in this country. No, but it is gratifying to see it changing over time, Like you see like plus size models everywhere, like they don't there's not like some big right up in people about how this daring um company clothing company used to plus size modeling, where it's just become a normal thing. Yes, it's becoming normalized. I think that's a big, big component because a lot of people point to the mass media in the West as the main driver for eating disorders because they say this is the ideal weight, body mass index, UM, body fat percentage, go attained to this, do whatever you need to do to get here, and if you don't, you're an ug face. Right. What I think is super interesting about this um because everyone knows that it's like yeah, sure, ads and models and and Instagram like that's that's stuff you should know, chump change. But what's really interesting is I mean, you know, we're not enlightening anyone as to that's not breaking news. Oh, I got what you meant, But uh, what's really interesting to me is to look at all, right, if it is media, what about pre television, like has this stuff increased? Or what about non Western cultures? What about if someone were to move over here from another country where Antorexi isn't very prevalent um, how would they change? And it appears that that does have an impact. It does, but not like h Night and Day kind of thing like you expect, Like the studies aren't just backing one another up left and right to where yes, it's the mass media, and that doesn't necessarily mean it's not the mass media. It just means that they haven't figured out how to control for all these confounding factors that also come along with something like moving to the US as an immigrant um and all the things that that come along with it in addition to being exposed to Western mass media. Or you know what else changed over time? Well, we got richer, food, got cheaper, junk food became more abundant. Maybe that has something to do with it and not just you know this this growing of mass media in the middle to late twentieth century. So there's a lot of studies that do say, yes, there does seem to be a correlation, just there's never been a smoking gun. It's like the same thing with violence in in media or sex in media. Like the the idea that the media just has no effect on us whatsoever is is ridiculous to me. But I also suspect it doesn't have quite the pronounced effect on us that we like to think or just assume. Yeah, they're like you said, they're just so many factors you can't UM control all of them. But there are a couple of interesting findings. This one study, they found a rate of eating disorders UH in places like Iran, Singapore, and Japan UM increased among women who were exposed to Western culture, either by being there for a little while or living there for a little while, even if it was just a vacation, or through media. And another one found that UM women who were at least one generation removed from immigration into Canada thought about dieting more than women who were immigrants themselves. Yeah, and and dieting behavior is UM a very Western thing, and it's starting to spread elsewhere. Like there's countries like Egypt and Iran and Japan and China UM where they're studying to notice eating disorders UM that are they're considered non Western cultures. But there again they're like, well, has the Western media kind of infiltrated those spaces more or is it people who have spent time in the West who are now coming back home and they've developed a neating disorder? What is it exactly? But there's a really big point to this that I think is easily overlooked. Is if if it is the Western media and it is something like saying, here's this ideal body image, get to it. However, you have to a lot of people in the West engage in diets and basically everybody in the West is exposed to that media. And yet less than five percent of people in the United States will ever develop an eating disorder in their lifetime. Why isn't it more prevalent if it's just the media or just trying to diet? You know, what is it that makes that extra step? And that, I think is where that um bio psycho component comes into the biopsychosocial thing. I think it's just kind of like a triple whammy that gets some people just right who may be genetically predisposed, who who maybe um psychologically predisposed, and then the right combination of social factors all converge to make somebody develop an orrexa or bolimia. Yeah, if you're an athlete, Um, this is interesting because you can have medical complications as an athlete who has to drop weight. Um. Either you know, some some sports you you have to have a lower weight, like if you're a dancer or a jockey or a gymnast or something like that. Other times, like if you're a wrestler you have to make a certain weight or a boxer a weight class. And this is not the same thing. I mean that it can be unhealthy weight loss. It's not the same thing necessarily as anorexia. But it looks like that could be a trigger for uh, anorexia, you know, after you stop your athletic career. Yeah, it's like that part in um, what was that that Channing Tatum Steve Carell movie set in the eighties where he's the wrestler. Oh yeah, the Fox whatever Yeah, Fox Hawk or something like that. Anyway, where that part where he loses a match and he goes and just binges, and I think his brother comes up and makes him like throw up because he's gotta keep wrestling and he needs to make that that class, that weight class. So the idea that that some people who engage in these sports kind of internalize that idea and that behavior and can become anorexic or um belimic. Uh. That like that just kind of makes uttering complete sense. Yeah, same with the army too, or not just the army, but the military where they have you know, weigh ends and fitness benchmarks. If you miss those, you're in big trouble. So people will engage in this this kind of eating disorder like behavior, but they don't necessarily develop in eating disorder, although some people go on to do just that. Yeah, it says there's this there's one study that found enrolling in the military led to an increase and eating disorders. Yeah, it's interesting, um and true stuff. He should know. Fashion. We'll talk about history here at the end, because I think all the other stuff was probably more important than the history and who first named it, but we like to cover our bases. And Anorexia nervosa was named by Sir William Gull. He was Queen Victoria's doctor, and he published a paper and this was, well, you're just walking my past, like one of the most interesting facts of the podcast. You like that fact? Yes, you take it man, I was being so generous. Oh, thank you, sir. He uh he Sir William Gull is one of the dudes who they all right, you think this is interesting? Fine? He may or may not have been Jack the Ripper. Yes, this guy who coined the term anorexia, was one of the first to to describe it in a scientific paper, is also one of the one of the people that is liked for Jack the Ripper. Yeah, you just said it again. So why did I even bother because you didn't You didn't enjoy it enough, you didn't relish it enough. Okay, I got you. So Jack the Ripper published a paper, uh in eighteen seventy three, and this is after treating young women who, by all appearances had anorexia what we now know is anorexia, right, And you could tell it was he was Jack the Ripper because the paper started dear boss, how long have you been sitting on that one, buddy? That just came up right now? Yeah? Why does this say dear boss on your paper? So? Uh? He had drawings in there. Um, eventually he had photos in there before and after treatments, and um, just like us today, he was uncertain about the nature of the disorder to begin with. Um, what we do know historically is the nineteen seventies here in America is where it really kind of became a big thing. And thanks to a couple of things. In nineteen seventy eight, there was a very popular book published by Hilda Brutsch, the Golden Cage Colon the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa and obviously and super sad Um. Karen Carpenter was the face of anorexia in America, and America got to see her struggle off and on with this for years until she died from complications from anorex in nine eight three. Yeah, she died basically from oregon failure from drinking too much ipecac over the course of her life. It was a big deal in the United States. I mean that really put it on the map in a big, big way. Yeah. So there is like, if there's a silver lining to the death of Karen Carpenter, and there are very few of those. And if you're too young to know who Karen Carpenters, do yourself a favor and go look up the Carpenters right now and have fun listening to that. Yeah. But ipocac is an a medic, which means you drink it and it makes you throw up. And for the twentieth century, maybe even the nineteenth century, to doctors recommended parents keep that stuff around their house. So if they're dumb little kid, you know, rat poison under the sink, you've give them some ipocactu they throw it up in their life would be safe. Well, they started to realize, especially after Karen Carpenter, that this epocac serve was being abused by UM and XIA patients and believe me, A patients all over the US. And they apparently called for a band on over the counter sales of ipocac, and that directly came from Karen Carpenter's death. But I didn't see that it actually ever went through. Oh really, Yeah, as as recently as two thousand three they were calling for a ban on non prescription epocac sales. And unless over the counter and non prescription are not the same thing, then no, they didn't get it pushed through. Can you buy it today? Do you know at all? Yeah? I mean I believe at the very least you could get it from a pharmacist, but I think you might be able to still buy it in a in a drug store. I'm not sure. I haven't tried, and this was two thousand three, but I didn't see anything about it actually being banned. Well, I just really quickly as you can see here two thousand eight as an article called epochac the most dangerous over the counter drug. So um. Interesting. Yeah, so they've basically just in to that tarnished Karen Carpenter's memory. So treatment is tough because, like we said, there are so many prongs, um, and we don't want to be down on it, because you can overcome this. But the obviously the end goal is is multi pronged as well. What obviously you want just physically is um to eat healthily again, um. But another big part of that is to feel better about yourself and to have a better self image and to overcome this mental illness that's the underlying cause of these physical symptoms. Yeah. UM, if you have a friend or a loved one or somebody you care about that has anorexia UM or bulimia UM, one of the things you can do is just be supportive and non judgmental in the hopes of, like you were saying, kind of help build their self esteem because it is definitely a crisis of self esteem is a big component of it. But what you don't want to do is make them feel bad or shameful for not eating. Um. You don't want to focus on the food because it's really not the food. The food is almost like a convenient UM. Basically, the food is the one thing that, say, a teenage girl can control in her life in some cases how much she eats or doesn't eat, and this becomes manifested in interacts the nervosa. So the idea that that no, just eat the food. What's your problem with food? It really doesn't have much to do with the food. The food is just this um kind of red herring in the whole thing. Yeah, the food is almost like the drug, except the ideas to not take the drug. If that makes any sense. It does not. I thought that was making sense as it was coming out of my mouth. I started to realize it didn't. Right up to the end. Uh, treating it is can be done on an outpatient basis. UM. They have high calorie supplements, dietary recommendations. Obviously, UM, if you have serious medical complications, you might have to have a hospital stay. But they have shown that just putting someone in the hospital has no improvement on the outcome of their mental health. Like you've you've really have to attack it from all angles. Yeah, and that's a big problem too. Is like when you have a medical like medical issues like a low pulse UM and you you are say emaciated, like they're going to take you the hospital, and the doctors are not necessarily psychologists or psychiatrists. Their doctors who are going to try to treat your emaciation or treat your low pulse UM. And that's good, you need that kind of treatment, but it doesn't actually heal the anorexia at all. UM. So there has to be a multi pronged approach. And in particular, if you do need to be nourished, like you're at death store because you haven't eaten and too long and your body has become malnourished in your organs are starting to fail um, you have to go to a specialist in this because I think we talked about in the Angus Barbieri short stuff the idea of refeeding syndrome, where if you introduce nutrients too quickly to somebody who hasn't eaten in too long, they can die basically from overdosing on nutrients. So you have to go to a specialist in in refeeding. It's not just something that anybody can do. The ideally you will catch this long before you could die from refeeding syndrome or anything like that. But it is, it is. It is a concern in an issue that you would want to go to a specialist physician for refeating. Yeah, and it's um we were talking about parents earlier too. It's also interesting that early on Gull and this continued for a while, UM felt that you know, the parents were could be a big part of the problem in this negative influence, especially if like it's all of a sudden it is being treated and parents like, you know, you need to eat and need to eat this, you need to eat that. Uh. And so they would they would move kids out of the home in order to treat them more successfully because a lot of times the parents were contributing to the the whole cause. And to begin with, you know, yep, they would call that a parent ectomy. Oh really, yeah, that's what Goal called it. UM. And so that's like one theory of treatment that the parents are the problem and you need to get the kid away from the parents, not not like get them into foster care or anything like that, but more that the the kids are are being oppressed in some wave by the parents. And Hilda Brooke b r U c H. I'm going with Brooke, Um, yeah, the one who wrote who wrote The Golden Cage. She concluded that the reason for anorexia was that the teenagers were afraid of becoming teenagers, that they just pleased the adults in their parents their whole life, and they were afraid to kind of venture out on their own. Um. And so this was some means of control. Maybe I'm not sure, but it definitely goes in with that paran ectomy thing where if you take the kid out and um teach them to take on this disorder on their own, it can really boost their self esteem quite a bit and potentially cure anorexia. As it is, that's one theory. There's another that basically is the opposite. It says, hey, family, let's let's get together and help this. That's right, it's like a family therapy. It's it's the Maudsley method. And this was based on the work of psychiatrist named Salvador, not Maudsley. Salvador uh, Menuchin. Yes, it's not the Manuchian method, though no one knows who Monsley is. Maybe that was his hotel pseudonym maybe. But this is like you said this, and this makes a lot of sense to like getting the whole family in there, because uh, if you go to therapy as a family or as metallica, uh, it's gonna it's gonna bear fruit most likely because especially with something like Interrexi and bolimia, that's there may be a lot of tendrils throughout your family that is, uh is potentially causing some of this to begin with. So get mom and dad in there, get brothers and sisters in there, and and I'll talk it out. It will probably help everyone involved. Get weird uncle al in there, oh no, never, just keep him at Thanksgiving and keep them quiet. But one of the things I saw about that family method is one of the techniques to use is called externalizing, where they're saying where they basically say, you have an interloper in your family known as this eating disorder, and need to come together as a family to get this eating disorder out of your family. You like, you guys, gang up as a family against the eating disorder, not against the person with the eating disorder or against one another, getting up on the eating disorder and support the person with it to help him right, Which is great. And like we said, you can recover from an eating disorder. JOHNS. Hopkins says that fifty to seventy five of patients with anorexia or bulimia will eventually recover. It's a lot. It's a really great recovery rate for what is ultimately, um a chronic mental disorder. Yeah, and can we shout out a website here? Yeah, there is a website called alsana dot com and it is an eating disorder Helpline of all stripes. So anorexia, bulimia, UM, I imagine bench eating, any kind of eating disorders. You can call eight eight eight eight to two eight nine three eight at any time and someone is going to be there and try and help you out. And you know we talked about all the time, just that first step super crucial. Yep, good job, thanks you too. Uh. Well, if you want to know more about eating disorders like an rexia or bulimia, you can go to where Chuck just sent you, or you pick up the phone and call and uh you can also just hold tight and wait for listener mail, which is coming right now. That's right, And yeah, we we should mention there are there are many, many, many helplines and many organizations. But again, everything I've seen is if you suspect that your friend or loved wine or sister or son or daughter has a eating disorder, like you need to confront it. They don't just clear up on their own. And it's not just a lifestyle choice. Yeah, that's right. The National Eating Disorder Helpline is another one E two to seven. N's to put that in our in our slogan or motto on the T shirt. Well, how about this, UH have a great listener mail today. So let's just encourage everyone to look out for their friends and family. And if you have someone in your family that you think may be suffering from one of these disorders, then UH reach out to them with compassion. And if you have one of these disorders, call one of those numbers and just take that first step toward getting some help. Yeah, very nice, Chuck, Thanks. I think that was even better than any listener mail. Of course, I've heard a lot of listener mail. Anything is better than listener mail. Tops. We're just kidding. We love listener mail And if you want to get in touch with us, you can go onto stuff you Should Know dot com and we've got all our social links hanging out around there, and you can also send us a good old fashioned email, wrap it up, spank it on the bottom, and send it off to stuff podcast at iHeart radio dot com.
