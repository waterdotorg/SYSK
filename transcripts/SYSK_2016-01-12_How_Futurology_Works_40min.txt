Josh: This delightful program is brought to you by Squarespace. Beautiful websites for beautiful bands like Walk the Moon band dot com. So the name of their tour is talking is hard. It's not that hard, guys. I'm doing it now. Most of the time. I can't stop talking. I mean you literally would have to cut me off one time. I told yeah, yeah, yeah, Alec Baldwin, we get it, you are talking too much. But you like square space and we like square space, so we appreciate you getting on our podcasts to help us plug one of our great sponsors. Welcome to you. Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant and Jerry's here and it's stuff you should know from the future, but not really. How are you doing. I'm fine, Well, good, that's good. I enjoyed. This was kind of neat, Yeah it was. It was funny, like when you're reading about futurology in futurologists a k a. Futurists, you tend to want to make it like more than it actually is, and when you look into the topic, it keeps having to be beaten down just because of the name alone. It sounds like a little bit like a I could do a seer. And you know, sometimes they're thinking about they're using these these really neat techniques to predict the future. Um, they're talking about some really mundane stuff, boring stuff economic forecasts, things like that how much oil will be left in thirty years, that kind of thing. But then on the other hand, if you're a futurologist, you may also be tasked with figuring out what technology we're going to be using in thirty years or you know what, what what color the shiny jumpsuits were all gonna wear will be? That kind this stuff. Yeah, I think one of my favorite things is to look at past future predictions. It's fun. Yeah, there's nothing that will make someone look less knowledgeable than going back to what they thought the future would look like in the year two thousand, like back in the nineteen thirties or forties or sometimes some of those things happen. Yeah, and then it's amazing. Yeah, that's like wow, you know, because sometimes these guys are like really really dead on And I was reading an article, Um, I think it was in Harvard Business Review, and it was a post by Paul uh Sappho, who runs a venture capital firm I believe called Discern. Yeah, and um, Paul staff was saying like he was, he was trying to get across that sci fi authors and future ologists their paths overlap quite a bit, but really there's pretty big distinctions. And even in this article they got lumped in together because sci fi writers do definitely use futurology techniques. But Paul Cepo was saying, like, yeah, but a real futurologist you have to use logic, whereas if you're a sci fi writer, you can just use your imagination. You don't have to back it up with anything. Creature ologists, you have to use logic that makes sense to the whoever's hearing your prediction. Yeah, And I think that's one reason why some sci fi writers have uh been right on the nose with some future predictions, because they're not hampered by logic and they can just uh free form, you know. But then it's just a lucky guess. No, I don't think so. I think they're still applying a lot of the same rules of uh futurology, but they're just not bound by you know, the laws of uh not not the laws, but you know the laws of logic. Yeah, exactly, I'm with you. But that's the best. It's fiction, though, I think, is something that logically makes sense. Yeah, because then it's it's just fantasy. Yeah, that's true. So futurology is um recognizing and assessing potential future events. Uh. I could have sworn Jonathan Strickland wrote this by the way it read, but it was not. It's very strickland desk. Nicholas Gurbus, Yeah, that's Strickland's alter ego. I wonder if it is. I've never met this Nicholas Curbus. But the point Gurbus makes, which I think is good, is it's a product of our times in many cases, like depending on where we are as a society, um, And like he makes a great point. During the Civil War there probably weren't a lot of like rosy predictions for the future American Civil War. But in the Gilded Age people a lot more optimistic, optimistic, so they may have you know, it's a whole different deal. Like during the Cold War, for instance, a lot of paranoia, a lot of cynicism, probably not to be a rosy outlook for the future, right like during the Gilded Age when it was rosier. Yeah, way more optimistic than the Cold War, which is kind of ironic because the Guilded Age didn't have anything to be optimistic about. They were just pretending. Hence the name, Um the thing is. What you've just said, though, is is kind of an argument against future ology because one of the big critiques of it is that a future ologist, they're not doing anything. Even if you're commenting on the past or the future, you're still really commenting about your present, your contemporary time, because that's what you or recent past, that's what you some what you've lived through and experienced. That's all you can really reflect on is and and future ology seeks to go beyond that. Well, yeah, that makes sense. So if you like, look at this thing that is happening now or just happened, then what is going to be happening in that thing in ten years? And it's it's a lot of times based on how the direction is currently going. Yes, okay, so um gurbis makes a pretty good gives a good example that the cell phone grew out of the telegraph, which ultimately is related further back to the smoke signal, sure, right, Yeah, But if you were a future all just hanging out around somebody who was sending smoke signals, would you be able to predict the cell phone? Probably not or not. Could you predict the impact of the automobile or the highway system? Maybe? But would you predict that people would um have sex in the back seat of a car because it provides a little well, I don't think they did. Or urban sprawl? Yeah? Could you predict excerbs and edge cities just because the highways got built? Yeah, and not a lot of people did, even though a lot of people said there's going to be horseless carriages one day, and it's going They're going to change things big time. People are going to be able to move around a lot more. But that doesn't mean that everybody saw every result of the automobile. Um, it was a game changer. Yeah, has what you could agreed? So? Um what we're saying here, And if it sounds a little weird that we're at once supporting and criticizing future ology, that's basically the fun thing to do when you talk about future ology is um to criticize it and be awed by it. Because a lot of times they really are super right, that's right. Uh. Futurology has been around for a long time. Um, I mean there since people were writing fiction, there were people predicting the future, but as far as um things didn't really get going as far as being meaningful until after World War Two, when the US started developing technological forecasting. Basically, like it was really important to try and see you where things were going militarily, right, because it was super expensive to develop new technologies. Uh, it could take a long time. So they started thinking, hey, we need to get some people on board that can kind of hopefully predict where we're headed here so we can make the right decisions. Yeah, because if it takes a really long time, like you said, to develop a weapon, by the time you have that weapon in deployed in the field, you're gonna need to know it's not already obsolete. The only way to do that is to predict what kind of warfare you're going to be engaged in. Because this is a time, like at the end of World War two, so many inventions came out of World War one and two war machine inventions that that things were changing so quickly that there was actually you can kind of put modern future ology into the lap of one guy, an Air Force general named hap Arnold, who saw that things were changing so fast that his air force needed to basically predict the future and see what direction it needed to go. So he looked around and he started tapping people to do that. One of the first people he tapped as a scientist UM an aeronautical engineer named Theodore von Karmen. Yes, he was a super smart dude, UM, and he led a team that did predict a lot of stuff like drones. UM and as far as you know, the military using drones, not your uncle who flies it around the neighborhood to film stuff. He predicted the rise of Brookstone, UH, target seeking missiles, UM, supersonic aircraft, and even the atom bomb. All of this was in one report to hap Arnold, Like this is like and this guy knocked out of the park. But um, he and his group were very much limited to small academic and military circles. Like the general public wasn't aware that this was going on, but his group. Von Karmen's groups so accurately foresaw the direction that that modern warfare was going that you can very also very resially make the case that you know, he basically created a roadmap to the future that the Air Force followed. So is his prophecy were self fulfilling because he said go this way, and the Air Force went that way and created all this stuff. Yeah, and then the UM the military and uh well, the Brand Corporation specifically, it grew out of the US Air Force and Douglass Aircraft in the mid forties. They said, well, having one person to say these things was great, but what we need is a team and a consensus among this team. So they kind of, uh, well not kind of. They very much patented a technique they called the Delphi uh technique d E L p h I and that is basically a technique where they're trying to get agreed on consensus from a number of people. So there's there's this very famous story about how UM the the Navy, I think lost a submarine, a nuclear submarine, or the Russians had lost the submarine something like that. There is a lost sub that they wanted to find and they had no idea where it was. So the Navy pulled all these different UM, different experts and all these different fields that might have something to do with nuclear submarines, whether um, aeronautics uh, people from Noah, all these people right and asked them where do you think the sub is? And no one hit it on the nose. But when they when they basically used um uh statistical distribution of these various opinions guesses of professionals, it led them right to that sub And that's what the Delfi technique does too. It it takes opinions of experts in various fields and says what do you think of this? And everybody sends in a questionnaire and anonymously, and there's no group meetings, so the group doesn't bow to pressure, no leaders emerge. They're giving their unvarnished opinion. And then after the those opinions come in there they they take that information and send it out again. So it goes in rounds and rounds and rounds until they finally come to a group consensus that in the future we're all going to be wearing metallic blue jumpsuits. Yeah. And what they're doing is generating what's known as a scenario. And a guy named Herman Kahn k h N worked with Brand in the nineteen fifties and he's the one that kind of coined the term scenario as it applies to futurology. Uh. A pretty good definition I found was a scenario is a a detailed portrait of a plausible future world, one sufficiently vivid that a planner can clearly see and comprehend the problems, challenges, and opportunities that such an environment would present. So it's it's you know, it's saying, uh uh. In the future, we're gonna have a scenario where they're going to be robots in every house. And one of the biggest ways that they work on scenarios is with something called bat casting, which is starting the end, which is you got a robot in every house, and then go backwards. How you got there? Yeah, how we how you got there? Yeah? Makes sense? Yeah, and scenario. That's a pretty cool scenario. They can also be as mundane as running a fire drill um where you're envisioning the fire broke out in the high school gym and so everybody needs to get out. That's a that's a scenario. It's as simple as that. There um the weather forecasts or economic forecasts that are run through computer algorithms. The computer algorithms the model. The process that it's going through is the scenario, and it spits out a possible prediction. It's almost like an effect then cause right, yeah, yeah, excellently, thank you. Uh So Herman Cohn worked with Rand and uh and he had did you look him up at all? Yeah, he's one of the inspirations for Dr Strangelove. He was described as a super genius. Yeah, he was super smart and he um he kind of was a bit of a celebrity at the time. He wrote a book um in nineteen sixty one called on thermon Nuclear War uh and then went on to form left Rand to form the Hudson Institute, where he basically was like, we're a group that is going to forecast the future. So he became It was like super popular book, and he spawned a lot of other books, similar books. We need to take a break, but we're getting We'll get right back to this in a second. So, Chuck, you're just talking about Herman Kahn being the super genius who was something of a celebrity. I read that Timothy Leary animated that he had taken acid with him. I believe that he was a part of the inspiration for Dr. Strange love and this book that he wrote called UM the the Year two thousand, a Framework for Speculation the next thirty three years. It basically established this outlook that UM that America and capitalism could do anything thanks to basically technological UM inventiveness. Yeah, here's a let's hear some of these um. There was a list in that book, one hundred technical innovations very likely in the last third of the twentieth century. Hundred Uh some of the first ten multiple applications of lasers, boom, high strength structural materials nailed it, wouldn't you think hallois Uh, new or improved materials for equipment and appliances. Now that's that's easy. Yeah, anyone can say that it would be better material and predict that now. Uh, longer range, longer range weather forecasting, more reliable weather forecasting. No, I don't know about that one. I think that was us. How about this here here are a few of the other ones. New techniques for cheap and reliable birth control for sure. Yeah. The pill I don't know if the pills around we should do a whole thing may have been the same year because it came out in sixty seven, was it? Yeah? Uh, Well, This book came out in sixty seven, right, widespread use of nuclear reactors for power duh, improved capability to change sex of a children or adult gender reassignment. We did a great episode on that pervasive business use of computers. Yeah, they're all over personal pages. Yeah, they came in what and then one of the other ones was home computers to run households and communicate with the outside world. Yeah, the Internet of Things. Yeah. They also predicted, um, the rise of the credit economy really yeah, that we currently are in interesting yeah, so um and that was just like a list, like a sidebar basically in the book, in this book, but the whole, the whole idea that um America and capitalism in the West could invent its way out of any problem we possibly ran across in the future was the premise or the position of this book, and it caused an enormous fewer in academic circles, and not just academic circles, because this book was one of the first to introduce to the public that there were such things as think tanks like RAND and that. Yeah, and that these people were sitting there thinking about the future and we're writing books about it. And it kind of became a hit thing, But the Club of Rome was basically diametrically opposed to the UM the outlook that Herman Khan had and the Club of Rome was a business consortium that conspiracy theorist is basically the seat of the new World Order. They are UM and the Club of Rome basically said, no, we were. We were establishing the gloom and doom camp that there's such thing as resource depletion, over population and we are basically doomed. Yeah, I mean we've we've covered this a lot on the show. Different people that have made wild predictions about We're gonna run out of this by this year. Thomas mathis, Yeah, very mauthusian. One of the books that came out of the Club of Rome UH in nineteen seventy two was called Limits to Growth by Danilla H. Meadows, Dennis Meadows, Jurgen Randers, and William Baron's at M I. T. And they had a very dire apocalyptic outlook of the future UM, as did a lot of other people at the time, and a lot of these were way off base. A lot of these dire predictions, you know, which happened over and over again. Yeah, and so on the Club of Rome's website. They defend them The Limits to Growth. No, not the Limits to Growth, the UM Yeah, the Limits to Growth book, basically saying that it's often mis cited as predicting the collapse of civilization UM due to renewable resource um overuse, and it doesn't do that. But they did use the same kind of techniques that Herman Kahn and some of his other colleagues were coming up with by by taking population um information, food production data, industrial production pollution, and non renewable resource consumption and then running scenarios through this model that they built using computers and coming up the scenarios they came up with. We're kind of grim. The thing is is, even though they missed the mark, they still helped establish a very young idea that we we can't just you can't just throw your McDonald's styrofoam on the ground, You can't drive a car that gets two miles per gallon, like, we can't live like everything is just forever abundant, that there's no such thing as scarcity. Yeah, it's a double edged sword though, Like I totally agree, but then it also when you're wrong about these things, it gives cynics something point to say, well, she we didn't run to oil in the early nineteen eighties, like you said, we would do anything about it. Yeah, I mean, man, that is a great point. It's a it's a very great point. But at the same time, what you're seeing here between the limits to growth and the year two thousand um they we still see this today with climate change. You know, it's like, let's do something about climate change. The other people say, no, we can invent our way out of it. And besides, if we do something about climate change, it's gonna mess with the economy. And these people are saying, forget about the economy. We're all going to die, or not necessarily forget about the economy. But maybe you can do both, you know. You know, my whole deal with that has always been just like why why take that risk? Well, we humans aren't very good at like preparing for future risk, which is I think one of the reasons why future alogists are so revered and and odd but also mocked and scorned, because they're doing something that's almost almost flies in the face of human nature. Yeah, you're really putting yourself out there when you predict the stuff. Uh, that was one other episode that that just reminded me of the ten thousand year clock. That was a great one. So um, the military, the United States military obviously has used it for years. Um then beginning uh when was this in the sixties or seventies that business got into it. So in V two, I think Royal Dutch Shell heard somebody at the top heard that there wasn't gonna be any oil in by five, and they went yeah. Businesses basically said, wait a minute, there are people that can actually use models to determine what the future might look like. How can we use that to make money. Well, let's throw money at him and find out exactly. A couple of other places to um that that were nascent think tanks and like grand was the Stanford Research Institute Futures Group in the California Institute of Technology. UM, early like kind of think tank breeding grounds, just smart people walking around thinking about the future. But that wasn't enough. Um, you can't just say this is what I think it's going to be like, you have to back it up. And we'll talk about how they back it up right after this. How do they back it up? Well, they use different techniques. If you're a futurist or a future ologist. You're going to be using techniques that um are pretty recognizable. But the way you put them together and the things you sort out, um, is what's going to make you successful or not successful. Right, So you're you like brainstorm ideas, Yeah, that's probably where you start. Yeah, just just like Blue Sky Territory as they say, yeah, you um imagine things using scenarios are games apparently game theory, but we got to do that at some point. Yeah, I've been avoiding it, like we could mess it up really bad, but we'll do it. Um. That that changed the the futurism feel tremendously when they came up with game theory, because it's a pretty good way of predicting how people will work. And that's one of the big confounding factors is you can predict something, follow every single one of these steps that we're talking about right now, um, and then people will just cut to the left all of a sudden, and your prediction just fell to the wayside because humanity went this way real quick. Or somebody invented a game changer, a game changing product or innovation that nobody saw coming. Yeah, what's that called disruptive technology, is it? Yeah, that's a good not like that, Uh, not a bad band name. Oh I wonder if it's not there. If so, it's made of like Silicon Valley, rich guy, it's like my side band. Right. Um, do you want to gather professional opinions using say the Delphi technique. You want to do historical analysis. Current trends are very huge and can help you as well. And then like you were saying, I think you call it back masking. No, that's uh, turn me on dead man, right, Yeah, that's what they do. They listen to the Beatles backwards. Uh where what it was it? It's not back masking, I know, but where they where you envision the future and then you work your way backwards from it. When you do this, you do all this stuff together and again back cast, back casting. And when you're when you're using this along with the computer algorithms that can model like the economy or the weather, um oil consumption or something like that, you can come up with something that you could rightly say is a prediction or forecast for the future where we're going to be again, though, um, just things happen, like for example, Herman Kahn did not predict the UM the oil crisis that came the year after he wrote another famous book in nineteen seventy two. Um he wrote a response, I think to limits the growth and just totally missed the oil crisis. Man. But how could he predict that? Because the oil crisis came out of the OPEC oil embargo that was punishment for the US is being involved in the Yam Kipper War. So you couldn't see that coming. No, And that's the big problem with futuro ology. Yes, exactly, our own US government has been wrong with the U s Department of Interior announced twice in nineteen thirty nine and then in nineteen fifty one that we only had thirteen years of oil left. So weird that both times it was thirteen years. They don't like to bother people, so they wait until there's thirteen years left, and they sound it's just such a specific number. Uh. What else, Well, we we've talked about More's law before. That has aged a little better than some other futurology predictions because, uh it is been revised over the years, which is sort of a cheat a little bit. But still, what I really meant was, I think he went from eighteen months to two years or something like that. But what's funny is Gurbis stakes his position in this article. He's saying, like the limits to growth and the other Club of Rome stuff, they missed the mark um because they predicted catastrophe and Moore's law predicts um technological innovation, so it's successful. So clearly Gurbas agrees with the Herman Kahn group rather than the Club of Rome group. I don't think it's subtle. I think you uh, you can't just say, like the gloom and doom camp has just been completely eradicated or proven wrong. Agreed, you know, yeah, Moore's law, I don't even think we said specifically. It predicts the number of transistors on integrated circuits and computers doubles every two years. And like we said, it's been updated and it's been pretty consistent. And so with Herman Khan's popularity and then the big high profile m book publishing argument that he got in with the Club of Rome that led to like a spade of other future ology books that we can remember it being a big deal. When I was a kid, I remember a lot of people talking about the near and far future. The one that I ran across in this article that I had heard of, but I didn't know anything about Alvin Toffler's Future Shock. I can't remember that. I think, did you read it? The cover? I guarantee would just give you a nostalgia I'm sure. Um, but it came out in nineteen seventy, and it predicts a future where too much rapid change technological change in advancement, it happens too quickly, and people get all sorts of stressed and just worn out and um basically have all all manner of terrible um reactions to it. And I'm like, oh, like I predicted two thousand fifteen, so like a person's emotions couldn't handle. Yeah, we're just overwhelmed through too much rapid technological innovation happens too quick. Do you think we're overwhelmed? Like I get stressed out by like say social media or something like that. Yeah. I wonder if it's a people of a a certain age maybe, Yeah. I would guess if you're born into it, you're used to it, so it would probably more more likely apply to a transition population, like the transitional generation. Is that what we are? Don't you get stressed by social media. Don't you get like this tents and uh yeah, I mean I kind of just hate it or having like having information and all this information and all if it's just so thin content wise or value wise, but there's tons of it and it's always coming at you. Wears me out. I got the future shock chuck at the Jimmy legs. Uh no, I totally agree. I'm like that. I just want to shut it all down, just everybody, not podcasts that should live on. Uh. So we talked about science fiction writers and how they are easily off the hook because they're just writers, right, They're not supposed to predict the future. Um, but they have been. You can't dismiss it because they've been on the money or close to it a lot over the years. Because, like we said, they're not hampered by the rational laws of today. They can just say whatever they want and if they're wrong, it's like, hey, dude, I'm just writing stuff. Yes this is fiction. Um. But a few of the highlights, um. Jules Verne mid nineteenth century predicted uh, going to the moon and a spacecraft. Not only that, so he predicted it would be shot out of a cannon basically. Um. But the thing that he really got though, was that he placed the moon shot in Florida, like a hundred and thirty seven miles from Cape Canaveral, where they do launch rockets to the moon. Not bad now And for the same reason to like that, it was it's close to the equator. Oh is that why? It's one of the reasons why. Plus Cape Canaveral is largely protected um by the Gulf Stream from hurricanes. Like as a hurricane comes ashore right before it starts to get to Canaveral, it goes out again and then hits North Carolina. Interesting, that would be an interesting conversation to have been in on when they were picking place, like where should we launch this? I mean, where should we put all of our money in? Right? Uh h g Wells. He predicted tanks. Yeah, he was. Supposedly he was the first guy to really think of himself as a futurist. He predicted adam bomb in nineteen eight, aerial bombing in nineteen o eight. What the name robot is actually coined by a science fiction writer, a check writer name Carl Kopeck and Um in nineteen one he named robots I think the all time winner, though is Hugo Gernsbach and Hugo Gernsbach. If you're into science fiction, you recognize his first name because he's who the Hugo Award is named after. You may also recognize his last name too, if you're a Hugo Gernsbach fan. But back in uh, I think the nineteen tens. Yeah, he wrote a book called Ralph one to four C forty one plus. He predicted everything in this Yeah you know what that means. It's actually a play on words. Uh one two It means one to four ce for one another. You get it? Wow? Yeah, that's great. One to four C for one and then another is the plus sign that that alone, I was sold, like, I love this guy. It's just like that Van Halen album Oh You eight one two exactly. So what has he predicted? He predicted solar power, like the realistic use of solar power. He predicted plastics, video phones, tape recorders, um jukeboxes, loudspeakers, tinfoil, rustpous steel, synthetic fabrics, all in one book. And he's famous in the Hugo Awards named after him because he wanted to make science fiction more science based, you know, using that same logic, So he would have been a very um like almost a father of future ology. Oh yeah, for sure. You know, here's a few other things that from that book. Um, this one to me, I'm surprised no one's done this yet. The appetizer, which is at a restaurant in an in an advanced scientifically advanced restaurant, will be a room that you wait in before you get your table that's flooded with gases that make you hungry. Oh, not bad, Just have a the appetizer room, right, we'll be ready shortly. It's like bloody fingernails and scratched into the walls that people are trying to get to the other room where the food is. Uh. The telt, the telautograph, which is basically a fax machine. Uh. The telefot which was a picture phone. UM had a universal translator where they translate any language right there on your in your hand. Not bad. And then this one I love. The vacation city was a suspended city and a domed suspended city twenty feet in the air that used the device that nullified gravity. And in vacation City, no mechanical devices are permitted because it was supposed to be a true escape. That's aweso from the mechanized world waiting for that one. And this was in nineteen eleven. He predicted just that there would be a need for that. That's like that town in um West Virginia, Green something, West Virginia where the people who have electromagnetic sensitivity ago because you're not allowed to have any electromagnetic stuff because there's like a radio telescope where there's something there could be interfered with, and you co could be amish. Can you just be amish? Like, hey, I want to be amish. If you're Harrison Ford, you could be yeah. Or Woody Harrelson, Yeah right, you got anything else? How about these predictions for the future, There's a couple in here. They are kind of funny. Ten predictions that missed the mark, and these are real predictions. UM In nineteen seven, U. S. News and World Reports said that by the end of the century, we will launch our freight across the continent with missiles. Like you order something from Amazon in New York, instead of having a fulfilment center nearby, they just put it in a missile and shoot it to you. Didn't happen, um No, But drones are coming. I really are they still on that? Probably? A guy named Alex LeWitt predicted nuclear power vacuum cleaners. Uh, this one I think would be pretty great dissolving dishes, and uh asked what it would be like in the year two thousand. A science writer named Valdemir come Forth. There's a lot of man. He's a fabulous science writer with the funny name Consonance in a row. Um, he said, you would basically, uh, put your plate in two and fifty degree water at the end and it would just dissolve it. No more dishwashing. Uh. Bucky Fuller predicted that Canada would be a subtropical climate because we've build a dome over it. That didn't happen. No, it didn't, which is strange because Bucky Fuller was pretty sharp. Dude. Here's another one, Um, was he really? Yeah? Buck Minster Fuller? Oh I didn't pick up on that. He's who Bucky balls who are named after? Really? Why? I don't? He may have invented him. I'm not sure. It's the those little balls that are magnetic spheres that like you shape in. Uh. Here's one a Scottish geneticist that um said in the nineteen twenties that in the future, one third of the babies would not be born, only one third would be born as a result of pregnancy, and the other babies would be born in a lab. Would they be grown basically exogenesis? Uh, here's the last one. Check you already. The Research Institute of America, which sounds pretty smart, said that, um, by seventy five, I'm sorry, this is several years before that, we would all be driving. Um. Personal helicopters did not pan out, Probably never will. I don't know if i'd want a personal helicopter, you know. I was, uh, for Emily's birthday. I rented a cabin in the North Georgia Mountains. Did you take a personal hell copter there? No? But I was sitting on the deck we all were, and way across the valley on the side of a mountain was this huge, huge house, and I heard a sound of a helicopter. It was like and I saw blinking light. I got up the binoculars and this dude had a helicopter and he took it and he flew it down about two miles to the lake at the bottom of the valley. And uh, I guess he has a lake house and a mountain house in the easiest way to get there, just to make the four minute elicopter flight. That's crazy. Yeah, it was pretty amazing. Wow. I want to know who that guy is. And that guy could be a lady. Yeah what am I saying? It could be Carly Fiorina. Yeah, is that she's the woman who's running for GOP president candidate?

My husband and I love your show, and you've solved our dilemma. So what to listen to in our car together? I want to let you know you did a great job on the HIV AIDS podcast. However, I think you miss telling a really important story about the AIDS crisis. Just before the AIDS crisis broke, a method for treating hemophilia called the clotting factor concentrate was developed. I finally let those suffering from the disease live into adulthood and completely change the landscape of the disorder. By the time HIV was discovered to be a blood borne virus, many of those suffering from hemophilia already had it, not to mention that many also contracted hepatitis. However, the pharmaceutical companies did not begin to pasteurize the drug in spite of their knowledge that it was spreading HIV until a strong public outcry prompted a government intervention. I think the story is not told often enough, and the injustice that these individuals suffered at the hands of big Pharma is undoubtedly one of the greatest our country has seen. Uh. There's an extremely informative and sad documentary on the topic called Bad Blood Colon Cultionary Tale. Anyway, that's about it, uh, And I'm sorry if I bummed everyone out there is from Shelby. Shelby thank you for not only that illuminating email, but also the documentary recommendation. We're always looking for those. Absolutely.
