Josh: Hey, and welcome to these short stuff. There's Chuck, there's Josh, that's me, and there's Jerry over there. Uh, no time to talk any further. Let's get started. We're talking about dolphins disarming by Are you gonna do that every time as long as I get a laugh out of you? Yeah, I will laugh every time. Well, then every time it is because I'm laughing, because then we do this and it takes more time than it does. I hadn't thought about that. Yeah, maybe I will stop doing that because I really do feel like pressed for time, Like you can see him perspiring across the top of my lip. Hey, let me try Josh Clark introw. Okay, hey, Josh, have you ever seen a dolphin? Yes? I have, Chuck feels like it does. It's kind of exhilarating. Yeah, especially when you know that that the other person has seen or done or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, you're in the club. So we've both seen dolphins. We have. Uh, and I knew about this. Uh. What we're talking about here is the fact that the U. S. Navy uses dolphins to find unexploded underwater ocean minds, right, And I knew about this, but uh, you know it was kind of cool just to see how exactly this works. It was well also to think a lot of people have the impression that the dolphins are there, like you know, they're sweating themselves, they're wiping sweats from their their brows. They're disarming these minds right like by like my flipper can't even hold these plyers right or was it the green wire or the red wire I'm supposed to clip? But that's all right, that's not the case at all. They don't actually disarm the minds. They don't even really get that close to it. What they do is they go find minds for like the U. S. Navy. It's not just the U. S. Navy that does this. Apparently, um Russia captured Ukraine's dolphin patrol in Crimea and the Crimean War. Recently they used Dolph Landgren. He can't swim, terrible joke. He sings like a stone. He he does. He doesn't like you would be a swimmer, does he? He know he's too he's got too much like muscle, you know, which I mean sounds counterintuitive, but yeah, he does look like he would sink for sure. Uh yeah, So what do you say Russians use him. I'm sure other people do too. Rite a lot of people do. And again it's they're not using them to disarm the mind. They're using them to find minds. And the reason they use dolphins to find minds is because there are um there's no technology that we have that comes even close to rivaling a dolphins ability to find something in very murky water with a lot of loud acoustic noise and um that that may be disguised to look like something else. And minds fall under all three of those categories. Yeah, so what a dolphin does and we'll get to how they do it, But they are trained to do this specifically with just like they would be at uh at stinky old Sea World with like you know, fish is their real board to do their little tricks. But they learned to search for these mines. Find one and like you said, they could be like fifty ft away. It's not like they have to go knock on it or anything like that, and it probably wouldn't explode anyway. Um. So they go find one, they swim back to the boat and ring a bell or you know, some sort of signifier that they've worked out. They set off a firework, they shoot a flare at the captain. Uh. And then the human says, all right, good job. Your work is not quite done though, because all you're doing is saying there's something down there. Now here is a uh, an acoustic transponder, and uh, you go take this. He puts it in his little fist, and then the dolphins swims back to the mine and now they have you know, it's like it's a transponder, so they actually know where it is now, right, And then they come back and they get the fish, which is really what they're they're kind of after. If you remember our Star Dogs episode, it's it's kind the thing like they're after a fish. They know if they go do this, they'll get a fish. And people think dolphins are smart. They don't. They're dumb because they don't realize there's fish everywhere in that ocean. So, chuck, how how would a dolphin do this kind of thing? Why is a dolphins so much so, so vastly superior to anything that humans can come up with technology wise? Well, humans are pretty good at coming up with technology. Frankly, that is correct. But um, we use sonar, and they use sonar. But they've been using sonar a lot longer than we've been using sonar. That's the point of this article. That really is sort of it. Like they mean, dolphins have been around way longer than we've been using sonar, and that's there their chief I mean, I guess it's sort of a communication device. Oh yeah, definitely is. They communicate, But it's also the way that they see I guess it's the best way you could put it. They see what they're there, well, they don't have ears. They see with we normally, what might think of these things that we might hear? Yeah, and that's why it's so tough to kind of wrap your head around what they're doing. But if you think about it, if if our vision is nothing but a bunch of electrical impulses stimulated by light that forms like a mental conception of an object in our brain, that's exactly what dolphins are doing. But they're doing it with sound. They're shooting out like a kind of thing, and when it comes back, it tells them about that object and it forms an impression in their brain just like we do. Visually. They do orally, but not through the mouth, I mean orally a a really well put uh yeah, and supposedly they are so good at this kind of echolocation that they can tell the difference from fifty feet away between a BB gun pellet being dropped in the water and a kernel of corn being dropped in the water. Yeah, which is again, now we're starting to reach the point where it's like, Okay, now I see why they're so much better than than our technology. Like, I can see that. I could if you put a baby in a corner of a kernel of corn next to each other fifty ft away, I can do that. I can see that. But if the visibility underwater, sure could, all right, if the visibility underwater is like two ft in front of your face, you couldn't do that. A dolphin could, which is why they come in handy, right. And so we talked about echo location with bats before. Uh, and I feel like with something else, but definitely with bats. That was one of our great long form episodes, probably whales Whales episode, Yeah, probably so. But dolphins used the same process. Um, they use their nasal passages and they make that little clicking sound that you did so well. Uh, they send it to the forehead and that focuses the sound into like a beam that shoots out into the water. Let's step one. Yeah, and then what happens after that, well after that because it's echo location, you know, it works just like with the bats. Things bounce off and come back to them. Uh. In case of bats, it's you know, mosquitoes and things like that, or or stupid humans with tennis rackets. Um, it bounces back to the dolphin as that echo and then they absorb that into their jaw like a tennis racket, like it's oh no, poor dolphin, poor dolphin. Uh. And this part is kind of gross sounding, but there is a um what Jane McGrath referred to as a passage of fat in the jaw, and that's just really just a conductor that conducts the sound to the inner ear of the dolphin, which and then all the nerve impulses get going and then the brain starts firing. And like you said, just like we see something, they can say, wow, that thing is around like a bb or it's shaped kernel shaped like a corn kernel, or where they go, hey, it's a c mine that things are gonna blow. I better, or that's a fish. I don't even need to go back to the boat, right, I can eat so chuck, Um, let's take an ad break and then we will come back and we'll talk about how not everybody's super hip with the idea of using dolphins in war. Okay, we're back, and like I said, not everybody is really happy that the U. S. Navy is using dolphins. And actually, I should say, real quick, Chuck, I want to fit this in. Um. Oh, I shouldn't have even said I wanted to fit it in. That's using up valuable time. So I the Navy started using dolphins quite by accident. I guess in nineteen sixty there was a study where they started paying attention to dolphins. They started to study them, like I just said, and um, they were trying to figure out if they could learn anything from offense to make torpedoes more I guess aqua dynamic so that they could move through the water horse you look to a dolphin, right, And they didn't learn anything for torpedoes, but they were like, wait, these things are super smart and they have amazing echo location. Maybe we should figure out something else for him. And they put them into use. Um pretty shortly after that they started training them. They said, they're pretty smart. But here's the hitch. They don't realize they're surrounded by fish in the ocean, right, They think they can only get them from this stupid bucket on the boat. It's also possibly just really lazy. Maybe maybe like if I had, like I can go to a grocery store, but if I had if I was laying on the couch and someone dropped by and dropped food in my mouth, right exactly all over it. Yeah, that's a really good analogy. I get it now. So um, alright, First of all, we we already said that they don't disarm them, and they don't even get that close. So you might think that even animal rights activists would be like, hey, this is fine. They're not getting close even if they did. Like I said before, they're not going to explode, because they're meant to explode when a ship hits it, not you know, any octopus kind of floating by, because that would defeat the purpose of putting a mine in the ocean. Right. Uh. So you would think like, all right, what's the harm then, But it turns out there actually is quite a bit of harm that could that could come about. Yeah, because if you have a trained team of dolphins that you know you're using in one place, say the Atlantic, and you suddenly need them over in the Pacific. You gotta get them from point A to point B and there's there's Dolphins may not be acclimated to the Pacific, especially if it's like the Northern Pacific and it's super cold and they're used to the Middle Atlantic where it's relatively warm. Right, That's one thing. Another thing is transporting them there alone is an ordeal for the dolphins. Yeah. I mean, anyone who's ever seen a whale or a dolphin or a big shark like wrapped up in that that sling being like lifted out of the ocean into a plane or something to a tank. It's just like it looks awful. Nothing about that makes it look like that any of those animals are psyched that that's happening. Right. Air travel is designed for humans, and it's a nightmare for humans, right, Imagine what it's like for a dolphin. Yea, at some points a lot of stress on their body and there you know, it might sound hippie dippie, but on their emotional well being, you know, on their earth spirit and well we've talked about zukos. This it's a real thing. Oh yeah, for sure, for sure, And I would imagine that if you want to drive a dolphin insane, there are worse ways to do that than putting it on an airplane taking it for a ride about. And there were um, there was actually uh, they were going to use some dolphins as part of a dolphin sea lion team. Sea lion or seal. One of the two. Think we'll sea lions do this as well. Then it was a dolphins sea lion team. They actually have can There are naval teams made up of sea lions and dolphins work together that not only discover minds, they're also trained to discover like underwater saboteurs, divers swimmers who aren't supposed to be there that want to like blow up a military station. And the dolphin will go find the guy, go tell the sea lion. The sea lion goes and puts an ankle cuff on the swimmers shut up, I'm not kidding, and they're tethered to a boat now like so the sea lion goes and arrests the guy and then they both go tell the navy that you got you got someone on the line. So the dolphins doing like some trick in front of the guy and he's like, wow, I mean, I know I'm supposed to plant this bomb, but that's pretty neat looking. And then he looks down and he's like, oh again dolphins and then the sea lion and the dolphin high five. Yeah, but that's so. They were going to set up a patrol in the in Puget Sound in Washington State. There's an army port there, and uh, they were going to set up patrols, and the I think some animal rights group said nope, not on our watch, and to raise public awareness, they started knitting sweaters for the dolphins. We're going to be transported to the to the cold water. And it worked for a little while. I think that that they have those things now, yeah, I'm sure there's a work around. So that's that is dolphins disarming minds, which they don't actually do. Correct the dolphins find the minds and h and many many people are still not too supportive of that, right, yeah, because I mean they're innocence and they have no idea what the wars, what's going on with the war. You know, they don't know what they're being used for. It's just it's a moral quandary for sure. Yeah. The one thing I couldn't find really quick before we go is what minds are disguised as. One thing I saw. The only thing I saw was that they can be disguised to appear like ripples in the water. And I'm like, how would you do that? And then I realized, oh, i'm sonar it would look like a ripple in the water. So I think they were talking about disguising them. I'm sure they do visually as well, but I think mostly on sonars how they try to disguise on interesting. Yeah, I would love to meet the person who's like, I know how to disguise the mind as a ripple in water. Yeah, that makes more sense. I was thinking like they would make it look like a big floating kelp mass. Yeah, so was I at first. And they might, but I couldn't find anything like that. I was the only thing for him. Very nice. Uh. Well, if you want to know more about dolphins disarming sea mines, hang around in the sea. See what happens. Uh, And in the meantime, get in touch with us.
