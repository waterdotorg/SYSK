Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from how Stuff Works dot Com? Hi, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, is staff writer here how Stuff Works dot Com. And with me is my fellow staff writer, the extraordinary Charles Bryant. Are you doing shut him? Are you? Yeah? I'm just waking up so fantastic. Well, you know, when you woke up this morning, you brush your teeth. I did, and you know what, just to prep myself for this, I drank some orange juice immediately after I brush my teeth. Well, I think we all know is one of the worst things you can do to yourself. And you did this on purpose, just to prep I did. I'm a method podcaster, Josh, and I thought it was the role required it. I salute the dedication to your cremer ship. Actually, that's funny that that you should do that. Well, it's not that funny if you're preparing for it, because that means you read this article. Why does orange juice taste bad if you brush your teeth? So since you read it, I guess we can have a pretty pretty intelligent conversation about it. Right, Well, we'll try. Let's see what you got on flavor. Uh, flavor, I've got a little bit on flavor. Uh. Flavor is divided into five different categories, which most four of what you've probably heard of. Uh, you got sweet, you have salty, you have better, you have sour, and then you have mommy mommy meaty tastes. Yeah, meaty tastes. I don't know why they didn't just call it meaty. Actually, I don't know either. I think O mommy is just as nice because everyone wants to know what the heck O ou mommy is. Anyways, you get to say them both. If you just said meaty, no, they'd say what's meeting and you'd say you mommy icebreaker? Yeah, exactly, a Japanese icebreaker. Yeah. Uh so anyway, sorry you got sidetracked. Um, flavor is all these different five things, and they react with each other to create different different flavors with flavor combinations, and you get flavor and temperature and consistency and smell and texture together and you have, uh what we know about taste. Well, it's kind of like all of the different toppings available from Delicious Pizza. Hut brand Pizza working together to create over one million combinations of delicious pizza. That's astounding. It is astounding and delicious actually, so we we kind of understand flavor a little bit. What we understand less though, is exactly how this works. Um. When I was researching taste for this article, I ran across an article written by one of our esteem colleagues, Sarah Dowdy, and she wrote on how smell works. And of course these two are are you know, they're work in conjunction, and actually we don't really know how either one works, but they're they're prevailing theories that explain both, and they're pretty similar. Actually has to do with our taste receptors, and they're supposedly shaped a certain way and they accept only certain shaped molecules, So like your sweet receptor is shaped so that it would only accept molecules that possess this maybe a sweet uh property to them? Right? What's the shape like? It's it's shaped like an egg. You don't want to know what do mommy shape like? It's terrible down there. Um, But that's that's pretty much what we're thinking. How how taste works? Um, And we have a little better handle on exactly what's going on with that horrible collision of orange juice and toothpaste. Do you you know what it was? I mean you read the article, right, Yeah I did. Um. One leading theory is that it's it's this chemical compound. Is it a chemical compound? I believe it is. I mean it's got three names, right, Sodium laurel sulfate, which is a surfactant, which is a fancy name for kind of a sudd saying agent. So you know, you brush your teeth and it gets you foam at the mouth like a you know, rabbit dog. Rabbit dog. Everyone likes this rabbit dog. It's never a rabbit cat. Yeah. You don't want to run across the Atticus finch when you have a mouthful of s l last you don't. So anyway, the the the SLS doesn't really do anything except make you think that your teeth are getting cleaner and it helps sell toothpaste. Yeah, well it's doing a heck of a job. Uh. And from our understanding of s l last, I mean, we we have a pretty good idea of what's going on on the tongue. Um, it's actually like Conan the Destroyer as far as phosphel lipids are concerned, These things are basically like little little coverings on your bitter receptors, kind of tones down bitter taste um, and it actually goes in and just destroys these things. But at the same time, it also dampens your sweet receptors. So when you have Saudio laurel sulfate on the tongue, your sweetness is down, your bitterness is up, and orange juice is among the worst things on the planet at that moment. It's like a perfect storm colliding in your mouth exactly and your left you know, with your knees pulled up to your chest, rocking in the corner, just waiting for this to subside. And how long does that take? Well, josh Lyn did a study, and I'm not sure why, but some doctor felt the need to do a study and he determined that it takes about an hour. It's fantastic. Case closed. Actually, hopefully the doctor had plenty of volunteers to try this out and your to do it himself. Well, if you want to know more about taste and what we think is going on down there, especially in regards to orange juice and toothpaste, read why does orange juice taste bad after you brush your teeth.
