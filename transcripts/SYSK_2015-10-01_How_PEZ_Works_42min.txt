Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know from the house stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles to Be, Chuck Bryant, there's guest producer Noel and this is stuff you should have to do. Do do do the Pez dition? Nice? I like that. Another NOL cast as well. Yeah, pretty exciting. It's part of the Knoll spin Wee, then ole stint We're gonna follow. Uh. Do you like pets? But I like pets? Do you like the candy? I? Do you like taste? I like the taste of Pez. Yes. Describe to me what happens when you can put a candy PEZ candy in your mound. Well, I put a PEZ candy, I pull the head back, the kicker kicks it out pop. Yes, nice, and I take it from the Pez dispenser with my tooth. Oh you don't really, you'd like go mouth the mouth with it? Sure? Well, to tooth to kicker. Okay? Uh? And then I, um, yeah, what do you do use your hand? Well? I don't eat petz, but back when I was eight, I would be delighted when I would pull the head back the little candy with chewed out now, pick it out with my hand, put in my mouth. Yeah, I use my teeth. Interesting, I would feel like I was like going into to make out with a daffy duck or something if I did that. Oh that's half the fun. Oh boy. Anyway, I don't care for the candy though. I wasn't done describing pez go ahead, sorry, And then I take it onto my tongue, right, and I start to savor the flavor of it. Typically I prefer maybe um, well, definitely one of the fruit flavors. I've never had a mint pez or chocolate pets, which is new. I would try the chocolate one, but say, like orange, We'll just go with orange. I'm sitting there. I let it sit on my tongue for all of like six nanoseconds, and then I started to bite into it, and it's very much like um. This explains why I like pests, especially orange pests. Once eight almost an entire bottle of orange flavored baby aspirin for the taste. That's why I like pests. How old were you then? Would be a kid? It's like twenty something? Uh did it? Yes? I was a kid? Well did you? What did it hurt? You know? Nothing happened to me. We talked about that before. It feel like because they aren't even it isn't even medicine. I wonder it's But how could you use a placebo and a little kid? I mean, I guess it worked, but certainly there's an age where they're just like I feel like half of parenting is probably placebo. Probably, well you would know now, well not yet, Well let me know she doesn't believe my lies yet. That will come later. Yeah, I mean, I'm surely kids are pretty dumb, so you can get them to believe anything. Sure, but there seems like there would be an age where they wouldn't They wouldn't make that connection, and a placebo wouldn't work. I don't think a placebo would work, like say, from birth. And I don't remember what age you can start giving kids baby aspirin. Baby don't even children as Anyway. I like PEZ. I like how it tastes. I like the experience of eating a pet alright, I don't care for pets. I also like the shape, the brick, the brick, the it helps with the taste. I saw we did the l a podcast pest this last weekend, and I can't remember her name, but a very nice young lady brought us some different candies and things. The Lego candies. Well, you jumped on that bag. It's like you want these lego brick candies and you're like, yea, give me a second time, man, I love those things. Yeah, And that's sort of this. I put those on the same category, which is just like compressed sugar right in like a brick form. As a matter of fact, it turns out the Pez company to the state uses about fifty thousand pounds of sugar every four days making its Pez candies. That's right. And here's a factoid for you, all right. It takes three thousand pounds of pressure to compress the Pez ingredients, which is not just sugar, into the delightful, tiny, disgusting brick that you love. I don't think it's disgusting. I don't like candies. I have another one for you. They make twelve million tablets a day at their Orange, Connecticut facility, the headquarters of PETS, and three billion Pez bricks are consumed in the US alone each year by people like me who like Pez. Yes, roughly twelve at a time, because that's how much the standard dispenser holds and if this kind of thing floats your boat right now, go check out how Stuff Works brain Stuff series on YouTube and typically look up the one on pop rocks that I did a year or two ago. It was really interesting stuff. Candy manufacturing is fascinating. I don't care what you say. No, I like manufacturing processes. I just don't like to eat candy. I got you. You know what I mean? You just go to the plant watch it made and then turn down the free samples, like, no, thank you. I find that disgust. Yeah. They're like, now, would you like to try some? Yeah? I don't do that on beer tours, I'll sample that. You mean. I went to the Maker's mark distillery. Oh did you dip your own bottle? Yes? No, yes, we definitely have one, but I don't remember if we. I guess we did dip it. Yeah, I think that's a thing. But it was like a mini, so maybe not. Maybe we bought a mini that was like just a mini to commemorate it, and they made you buy like a fifth or something and dip your own bottle and we're like, ma, got it's fine, because we we'd be like we would want to open it. Yeah, we didn't dip our own body forgot. That was exactly the conversation we had. Wow, you guys put a lot of thought into that one. Anyway, it's a pretty cool tour, to tell you the truth. I strongly recommended. I've never done a distillery. I'd like to do that. There's there's a new one here in Atlanta, in Avondale Whiskey Distillery. Well, I can tell you go on any whiskey tour and you will find what Mila Kunis is talking about with the angels share stuff. It's a real thing. The evaporating whiskey fills the um whatever the place where they're aging em barrels, and it's actually really dangerous, like the place could blow up at any time because like very much so, we're a sugar factor, right, um. But the smell is one of the most amazing smells I've ever experienced in my entire life, like smell good or just weird great, Like the the half of a percent of whiskey that is just glorious. It's in the air. It's amazing. Oh man, that I'm thirsty, all right, So let's talk pez um in two thousand eleven. This is something I didn't know. There was a wedding while I didn't know this part um in the United Kingdom between a guy named William and a little lady named Kate Waity Katie? Do people call her that? Some? Some people did, what like that she's overweight? No? No, that she waited around? Oh okay? It was like, man, how mean can people get? Yeah? That would So they made um specialty pez dispensers out of Prince William and Kate for that and they were expensive, three d sixty dollars at a charity auction. Clearly that's the most expensive Pezz dispenser ever sold. Not so, my friend, what supposedly that is the thirty two thousand dollars in two thousand and six for an astronaut limited edition Astronaut themed It was from the two World's Fair and there were two of them too in existence. Yeah, that's why it's expensive. And what's neat is that that's that was That auction took place on eBay, which is very appropriate that Peest dispensers are sold on eBay because the guy who founded eBay, what's his name, Pierre Um, Pierre R. Right, He Um founded eBay and party he was inspired to found eBay because his girlfriend at the time I think his wife is his wife now um collected pez and he thought, hey, this would be a really great We may not have eBay today if it weren't for petz peest dispensers electing peest dispensers, which is a relatively new thing. It really took off in the eighties late eighties. Actually it wasn't until the late eighties that people really started collecting peest dispensers. And now I felt, you know, the tweete Bird episode. I had to go back and look it up. But once I did, I started to remember, Yeah, I think Elaine and Jerry and George Ritta George's girlfriend's piano recital, and Jerry put the tweetie Bird pest dispenser on this laper on Elane's lap, and Elaine started laughing, ruined the performance, and then she was later outed when she laughed again in front of that lady, right, And then the tweety bird um Pez dispenser also factored into the plot because Jerry and his friends had an intervention for another friend who had a drug problem and he was resisting resisting, and then for some reason Jerry brought out the Pets dispenser. In the wave of nostalgia that washed over this guy caused him to admit that he had a drug problem, but then he became hooked on pest. Well in nostalgia figures in a lot, Uh, it really does. Kids from the well, kids of all ages grew up with pez kids of all ages? What am I circus announcer? Step on up? What do they call? I was gonna say, circus ring master, circus barker. Well, there's two different Those are two different things. I think unless you're in like a low budget carnival, then it's maybe the same thing. Yeah, that's I would be. But the barkers, the one who's like, step on up, well, guess your weight, the people he's trying to get people to come in. The ring masters, the one who's like running the show once the show starts. I feel like i'd be the barker. Would you need to be the ringmaster? You'd have to wear a straw boater hat and like striped suits. Yeah, I'd be the barker, and you'd be the guy that like swings from things with his teeth, strong teeth as opposed to my little weak teeth when I fell off and there's some of my teeth jammed into the trapeze bar. Still, well, you like a Loonington's cartoon, now, yeah, but imagine it in reality even worse it is. Uh, I feel like we should take a break and regain our composure. All right, we'll be back right after this. All right, so we're back, and I think we should uh start in the traditional way that when we handle our culture casts and talk about history, because well though I thought it was a pretty interesting history. Actually, yeah, I love this article. Edward Hass the third he was an Austrian. Um he was He made sweets. He was a confection ere. Well, his family was in the grocery business, and he was successful in that. But yeah, his heart was in candy like yours. His heart was in candy. It was also in hygiene. I get the impression that he was very strong germophobe. Well it's probably good when you're running a candy factory. Yes, you know. He was also anti smoking, and he decided he went to a chemist, uh pharmacist, and said, hey, give me some really strong pepperman essence. And he used that with some sugar and made mints, basically a proto altoid um, and put him in little tins and marketed him as quitting smoking or smoking cessation a. Basically, if you're trying to quit, you needed something to put in your mouth, just chew one of these Pez mints. That's right. And he got the name Pez from the abbreviation the German word for peppermint, which is uh. It starts with three consonants, which is always fun. Come on, you took German, you know Germany? Well, I mean I would just say, uh, fefa mints. I would say, I like that better. That sounds like the remix version. But it does start with two p's and an F. But shorten that and take out letters from the beginning, middle, and end and you get peasy. So uh, like you said, he said, you can either use this to try and quit smoking as a sort of an early version of nicarett gum, even though I had no nicotine in it that we know of, Or you can use it if you do smoke, to make your breath fresh, because no one wants to smell you stinky smokers. Uh. And we'll see, well, will wrap them up in like a little candy bar at first, and that's how we sold him for like a year. Well yes, um, they were also sold in tins, right, and he invent in PEZ and that's when they first set the market. Um. But again I get the impression that he was a germophobe and he didn't want everybody to put their grubby hands into the same Pez tint and touch the other ones that other people were putting in their mouths. And he probably imagined all the poop and bacteria and who knows what on those people's hands, sausage touching his beloved Pez. So we thought there has to be a better way to dispense Pez. We need some sort of I don't know, PEZ dispenser, that's right. And so there was an employee at his company, Oscar Uxa, and you know what Oxcar Uxa does. He's a dispenser genius. And he says, hey, how about this, Why don't we make a dispenser that looks like a cigarette lighter because this is his first smoking and I'll have a little contraption on here that kicker that'll spit out one at a time. And he said it's genius. Right. Edward Hoss kicked the Kleenex boxes off of his feet and stood up and hugged oscar Oosa. Yeah. And by the way, they're selling them in tens again now in Peppermint with a little throwback retro looking um. One of the Pez ladies Pez girls. Yeah, the Pez girls, which were supposedly like this very sexy thing to sell Pez. Did you see them? Yeah? They look like bell hops. Oh yeah, they're they're basically drawn like pin up girls, except not nearly as racy. Um. And they have a little bell boy hats. Sure a lot of them did. Um. And they went from the forties, I think, all the way up until the early eighties they used Pez girls to market Pez. Do you know what they reminded me of was um back in the day when you would have like be at a club and a and a woman would come around, see yeah, stick it ahead. Yeah. They would have a little tray around that was hung around their neck with cigars and cigarettes and mints and uh, who knows what else Pez. I guess Pez. I guarantee you Pez was in there. You're probably right. So um. So they were a hit among adults in Europe big times. Yeah, they did. They did the trick. The Yeah, they were already pretty popular. But when once they packaged them into these um cigarette lighter dispensers, like they really cemented themselves as like iconic candy. People say, look, you just pop it open and then candy comes out and you put your teeth on. It's right, it's wonderful pop off. So they went they went nuts for the stuff. And then he said, you know what, let me expand the United States is where it's at. Two. Uh. He found out that kids in America, we're delighted over this because I guess kids in America were like adults in Europe at the time, um, and they'd love the way these things popped out, plus and power dobably made them feel a lot like they were smoking. You think probably I never got the tie to the lighter. It was completely lost on me. So you like flick a lighter. We got it now, But I never had made that association until I knew this. Okay, so imagine a Peest dispenser without the head. Oh yeah, that's what the original. Can imagine that because I used to take the heads off my Okay, all right, but so that's the original Peest dispensers, which are called regulars now the first one before they started adding heads very much resembled like a nice slim lighter. So if you're a kid like this kind of thing, like there's a there's the manual thing where you're flicking a lighter. Then there's the oral fixation that's satisfied by putting the mint into your mouth, and it's mimicking smoking, which is one of the reasons why it was one of the ways it was marketed. The idea was that it would it would alleviate that desire for those those Freudian fixations that you had when you were a smoker, if you were trying to quit, if you're a little kid and you wanted to smoke, but you just couldn't get your hands and cigarettes yet a good way to do this didn't have arms right in the fifties, Yeah, probably. I saw candy cigarettes the other day in the store. By the way, I thought those were they make this? Yeah, I thought they were completely gone. Okay, if you want to know a candy that I think is abhorrent and disgusting, candy cigarettes. Gum cigarettes are awesome. Do you remember those the kind where you puff them? Oh, those are great. The candy cigarettes, they're just like sticks of candy that are disgusting. No, I'm talking about the gum that would blow out face smoke. I love that they still make those. But the gum cigars, I think we're gross. They have some weird chemical taste to them. I never saw that they were not one and the same, which is surprising. And they still make those, and they still make big league chew yes like it's it's amazing that they can, still, like with good conscience, market tobacco products to children, and that they're allowed to. I remember um probably the greatest tasting gum of all time, big red No. No, it was a Rambo gum that was sold to commemorate Rambo three. Yeah. No, it had like a It was marketed as like black raspberry or something like that, but it didn't taste like that at all. It had it. I've never tasted anything like, you know, usually like you run into a taste years later, like there's only ten tastes or ten cents, you know. Um, this was I've never experienced it before after and it was the best tasting gum ever. But it was in the big League chew pouch and it was big league t shirts, so clearly It was made by the same company for the makers of Rambo, but the flavor they used was perfect sweat and gunpowder and you could get it for like one summer. What did it have a cartoon version of of stallone on it? No, it was a photo of him with like the very famous rocket launcher from Rambo three um and uh it was just a picture of it on the Big League two pouch. Yeah, and I loved it. I guess they had to market it that way because first blood gum didn't go over so well. Exactly tastes just like blood. Uh Man, I'm wondering all kinds of things. Well, hold on, hold on, we're getting ahead of ourselves. Oh no, we're getting super distracted. That's what it is. In the fifties, kids very surprisingly liked Pez but they were like, this is pretty strong mint. And I'm a little kid, sure like fruity flavored stuff. Yeah, I like the dispenser, but gonna get your game going with the candy exactly, And and Hass and company listen big time. So they kept Mint Pez still, but they started releasing lines of of fruit flavored ones and kola. They had one called Chlorophyll Coffee flavored a yogurt one that probably was just European. What is the chlorophyll? I couldn't get a read on what that was like um, and I looked. I think it's like a UM, it's a mint. It's a definitely in flavor. Um. Did they just use the wrong word. There's another There's a gum out there that has a similar sounding names. It's just like a very bright like mint, not peppermint. It's not as sweet. It's mintier um. But yeah, chlorophyll is interesting. But they had other stuff too, like orange and I think cherry maybe something like that. Traditional flavors, but not peach. There's a fun trivia effect for you. They have had peach flavors, but it was never released in the US. Yeah, I'm a weirdo. I don't like peach flavors or peaches. So since they realized that kids are going bonkers for this candy, UM, which bonkers, that was another good candy too. I don't know what that is. It came out in the eighties. It was great. UM. They they decided to try to make pez a little more parent friendly because even back in the fifties, I think parents were like, I don't want you teaching my kid to smoke with this candy. So they said, well, let's change it from a cigarette lighter into something different, a toy, and we'll add like a beloved cartoon character on there. How about that? And it was genius because what he did was he combined candy with a toy, uh, and not only a toy, but a collectible, and it was it was genius for kids. That was all they needed. Um, they were pretty cheap and so kids could buy them. They could like go around and probably finding money on the ground in a given day to go buy a little pet dispenser, right, or build like a like a soapbox racer and sell it to the rich kid in the neighborhood, buy a bunch of pez did you fund Yeah, that's another thing too. I didn't like the the stick that you had to lick, but the sugar was just great. So the sugar stick that you dipped into the sugar, the sugar stick didn't have enough flavor for me. Yeah, it just I was thinking about fund it the other day when I was driving for some reason. It was just remarkable to me that they would just make a sugar stick that you dip in different flavors of sugar and you would then eat the sugar off the stick and then eat the sugars right. Well, they they didn't even try back then. Like it's like smacks used to be called sugar smacks, and then they changed to the honey smacks, and they're like, let's just go with smacks. That wasn't just called smacks, I believe. So it's not sugar smacks. No, it hasn't been sugar smacks for years. I don't need much cereal. Like they would get chased out of the grocery aisle whenever they tried to restock that if they still call it sugar smacks. I just don't mess with Captain Crunch. Peanut butter, that's all I gotta say. Captain Crunch has one out now. I saw on the cereal all the other day. It's sprinkled donuts Captain Crunch, and it looks awesome. Yeah. I just the peanut butter is so good. Even though it tears of the roof of your mouth, it's worth it. But that's a fatal flaw, don't you think not to me? Ali, I'll get a box of that, like every three or four years. I'll get a box of that, like when Emily's out of town dinner time, because if she would come home and see that, she'd be like, what are you doing this in our house? Are you a child? Yeah? I just have to save those moments, all right. So it's ninety. Um Has is super rich because he's selling tons and tons of these dispensers. He sells the company and uh, they move well. The manufacturing of the dispensers is actually now in China and Hungary and like UM Slovenia I think, to the Central Europe and now Asia as well. But the actual candies are and have been for a very long time made, to believe you already said at a plant in Orange, Connecticut. UM and they kept it going. Pez was always a privately owned company. I don't think it's ever been public UM. But they kept the whole thing going even after Hassa departed, and that was helped very much by this this um explosion in collecting that came from the late the mid mid eighties, I would say. And as a result, um Pez itself added feet to the dispensers so that they can be displayed. From that point not and they realized, like white people are collecting these. There's like a secondary market that's generated exactly um and so they added feet to it. So now a Pezz dispencer can stand up. But that was introduced in seven. So if you see feet on your Pezz dispencer, you know that it's at least un on. All right, So let's take another quick break here and we will come back and talk a little bit more about the odd collecting of Pez dispensers. So, Chuck, people started collecting pezz dispensers partly because they came of age at a time about the mid eighties when they were high on cocaine and had a lot of disposable come and we're nostalgic for their childhood. Yeah, I have a theory, and it's not like I'm sure everyone knows this, but I think pest dispensers became collectible because you can't throw throw it away like you would eat the candy and what are you gonna do? As a kid, you can be like, let me throw away this Garfield toy. Now, well, not only that, you can know you put it on your chef, right, your chef, You're like standing still, chef, stop making that stew weird. So I can put this penticipencer on the bullion. These can wait. Um, but thet the whole thing is they're reloadable like that. You get the little U the little packet of twelve, pop it in there and you want more, like if it's uh, it's one of those same deals like collect all four. But this is not all four. This is constantly new licensing deals being cooked up, everything from Looney Tunes to Star Wars to Hello Kitty. Which was the other stoke of genius was partnering up with these uh I kind of brands and cultural icons to uh to say, hey, a Chewbacca head on this thing, like they're grown adults little by that. Right. The thing is is Lucasfilm. Uh definitely charges a pretty penny, or did before they sold the Disney and now it's even more. I'm sure to license anything from Star Wars. Right. So, PEZ also very frequently came up with their own stuff as well. Uh, there were the Pez Pals. There was a very famous misstep called make a Face Pez, which is like a tiny Mr. Potato head where you could put on different eyes and mouth and stuff. But of course these things were a major choking Hatzard and Actually, there's a lore among Pez collectors, who are called pez heads that if you look at some of the nineteen seventy nineteen seventy three Indian chiefs that were released, their head dresses um are marbled. They have marbled color, and they're saying that those are ground up make a face um dispensers that they reused in the head dresses. That sounds like a peaz enthusiast conspiracy theory, but it's pretty cool. And another one that they released was a series for the bi centennial that includes the funniest character of all time, in my opinion, the colonial soldier with a head wound. Okay, I thought you can save the Paul Revere. I think there is a Paul Revere. No there is, which is I thought would be a pretty weird there's a Paul Revere Daniel Boone who looks like he has like a a well formed bee hive on his head rather than a coonskin cap. Uncle Sam, Yeah, there's a Betsy Ross uh. And then there's the wound, the head wound soldier. He's got like that white gauze on his head with a little blood dot coming through, and he looks just kind of out of it. It's a really weird peasant spencer. That was probably my favorite, although I like a lot of the the Halloween themed ones from the seventies. Some of those glow in the dark, which is pretty neat, Like Mr Skull. Did you see him? Their Doctor Skull? I think I think he's probably my favorite. Or the Pumpkin from the seventies on the green stem is probably the best pezz dis spencer of all time. Well, there have been four hundred more than four hundred and fifty dispenser since nineteen including three different Santas, and the Santa is the best selling of all time, which makes sense, of course, especially the first one because he was his His dispenser wasn't just a little peas spencer. It was like the whole body. But then they're like this is way too expensive. Yeah, they're like a bunch of people just buy it with the head. Yeah, And they did the Salvador Dolly tribute. I don't know if it's a tribute. I bet it was. Um is my favorite in the psychedelic hand. It was a hand with a green eyeball and it's just very cool looking. Yeah, like I would I would want one of those. Of course, I wouldn't pay thousands of dollars for it. I'd like to just find one on the street. And it's pretty neat. Though. Yeah, do all of them cost that much? But what that specific collectible? No? But I mean would say they ranged in the hundreds and it's real. But what was interesting about this? Um? I think Patrick Kiger pointed out, like it's compared to a lot of other collecting hobbies, this is Pez dispensers are relatively cheap. You can get into him pretty easily with you know, a minimal amount of money. Um. One of my favorite Pez dispensers is the Pez Gun series. First it was a ray gun, and then they made it into a handgun, and then when Star Wars came out in like, they released another space gun that looked an awful lot like Han Solo's gun, but it wasn't really sem um, but the kid would put the gun in his mouth and pull the trigger to dispense the can Wow. Yeah really yeah, unbelievable. They have had some kind of weird ones over the years, like the Airline Pilot and Stewardess, which I don't know is that a big seller? I don't know. Well this was back in the day. I think when they were they were revered figures and culture. Yeah, the pilots weren't drunks, and the flight attendants weren't flight attendants. They were stewardesses, and they were you know, fancy clothes, and but they have like hard chiseled features. They look like they look like real people. They look like pilots and flight attendants from the Mother Road during the depression or something, you know, like really chiseled features. And actually, apparently the Pets Company says that they very infrequently do real life humans. Those those bicentennial figures were the first humans they ever did a real life humans, I should say, And they didn't even do fictitious ones very often, like a stewardess or the pilot um, because they just found that the human face wasn't nearly as interesting as say, like a bubble man. Yeah, you know, in two thousand and six they issue the first ever Pets dispensers of living humans when they decided to pay tribute to the fellas from Orange County. Chopper makes me so sad that goes down in history is the worst one ever. But I mean, those were the first guys to ever have living Why why a licensing deal? And it opened the floodgates after that, After that it was on. There's like a kiss collectors set. Well, of course because Gene Simmons and he'll put his face on anything. Um. There was what else, Well, people get turned down a lot um. You said that other little fact sheet. Kim Kardashian wanted a pet dispenser. Um, they said no, Yeah, they turned down people all the time because apparently everybody wants one. I would suggest just go make your own babble heead because you can get that done. It sounds the same. Well, you could just put candy in your bubble heads. There are newsletters, there's a pez Collector's news, there are conventions, and there is even a museum that a husband and wife started in California that started out weirdly as a museum for computers and Pezz dispensers. I know, I think they were a computer sales company. Oh. I thought they displayed like vintage computers. I think they Yeah, it was a computer dealer and they they were selling computers, and just to kind of make the place look a little more interesting, they also displayed pees dispensers and they found that people were way more interested in coming to see the Pez dispencers and weren't buying computers, so they transitioned over to a straight up Pez museum, the pez um or the Museum of Pez Memorabilium, Berlingame, California. Yeah, and you can pay some money to go in there and look at all their rare and vintage peest dispensers. They have one. He paid three grand for the pineapple wearing sunglasses because in the early seventies thing. Yeah, it's nothing special to look at, but again it's rarity. They didn't make many of them because it was ugly. Probably, Yeah, that's kind of cute. Did you did you like the California raisins? Yes, okay, that explains it. Have you seen straight out accounting? Uh? No, not yet. It's a good Oh you haven't seen that yet. I haven't been to any movies. You should. The California raisins appear by mentioned. They're mentioned in a surprising way. I look forward to seeing that on television. You should go see it, man, Yeah, all right, we'll go see it in the movie here. What else? Uh? They tried vitamins for a little while. Yeah, I didn't think that was a bad idea. Put a little vitamin c in there, parents might be more willing to throw up some money for the for the kid. But um, they said, no, we're not in the vitamin business. Let's just stick to the sugary pressed candy. No. And the guy who said that was a guy named Scott mcwinnie, And Scott mcwinnie was president. He started out I think General Mills or something or General Foods, and um he moved his way over to Pez in the nineties or the eighties, No, the eighties, because that quote was from he was president of Peza and he um, much to his chagrin, got into a um a war, basically an economic war with the guy who was known as the Pez Outlaw. Yeah, you dug this up. This was really interesting. Uh. The article what was it called. It was a terrible title like Michigan farmer makes four million dollars in Pezz dispensers in three years or something. It's a terrible title. Should have been called the Pez Outlaw. But it was in Playboy and it was pretty good long form reporting. Yeah, basically what happened was in the nineties a dude uh named Steve glee U G l e W. Found out that, hey, over in Canada, they're selling different dispensers that you can't get here in the United States. So let me go over there, let me buy some of these and resell them to collectors. And it worked, and all of a sudden, the light bulb went off and he said, at think I can actually make money getting Pez dispensers from other countries. And he found a hook up that mysterious woman who approached him from the Eastern Bloc wherever she was from, Yeah, and he ended up. He and his son Joshua Um started making trips to Central Europe, um oftentimes right along the border of like war torn Croatia, and found these factories where Pez is being made, and found very bribable factory workers who would take like molds and make um new PEZ dispensers to his liking. And then he would sell them as like basically like Pez freaks or or one offs or something, and for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. But he would spend a quarter or maybe a dollar on each and he supposedly made quite a bit of money. He claims four million. Yeah, I believe it. For if they made the number of trips that they were making. I think that he did. His downfall was that he overextended himself. He took out a massive own and uh basically hired a factory to make a bunch of misfit Pez dispensers and downfall, and Mark mcwinney took him on and started releasing basically Pez's own version of these counterfeit weirdo dispensers at a lower price and drove the dude out of business. This could be a little documentary easy, you know easy. Also that reminds me. Have you ever seen the Jellybelly documentary? Oh, it's so sad, but it's so good. What's it called? I don't remember. Just look up Jellybelly documentary and weird owls in it. Oh wow, yeah, Well then I definitely won't see it. No, you really should, man, it's a great documentary. It's just it's very sad. And that one and the show Biz Pizza one documents to Yeah, I used to love show biz. You will love this documentary. I like show biz more than Chucky cheese. Even there's a huge backstory to it that you were unaware of. Can I read you this one? Xta. This is from the story about the Pez Outlaw. Uh. A nineteen toy convention changed Steve's life forever. As he tells it, a mysterious woman opened her jacket and showed him a silver globe PEZ holy grail for PEZ collectors. She whispered to him in broken English, there are many more where I come from. Let's go great. Do you believe that? And then she get the field she was like two guys in overcoats and sunglasses came in like hurried her away. He said, but but what's your name? Or two centambites came out of the woodwork and like pulled her down to hell. Ivanka. Uh yeah, it's a pretty good article. Look up stupid title Michigan Farmer, PEZ playboy and it'll bring it up. I think long Form had it at one point, speaking of Ivanka, should I talk about Donald Trump? Probably not all right? Um. I was surprised when I found out I found mention of like PEZ this was being nostalgic. I was like, definitely not for me. Then I went to Pez dot com and clicked on Collector's Corner and they have well, they have pictures of like every every single one they've released over the years, year by year, and I definitely felt nostalgic. And I don't even think of PEZ is factoring in largely into my childhood at all. Same here, but I was a little nostalgical. It's cute, So go to PEZ dot com and check out the collector's corner and I think you will waste a lot of time there. Uh. And I think that's it because Chuck just grabbed the listener mail email, which is usually a signal for me to shut up because it's mean to me. After the mics aren't recording any low please uh. And if you want to know more about PEZ, type that word in the search bar how stuff Works dot com and uh, it's time for listener mail. IMNA call this. You guys are right screw college. Remember when we a little soapbox moment? Was this from the animator? Yeah? I thought this is good. Hey, guys, want to shoot you a quick email to thank you for mentioning the idea that you don't need to go to college for some professions on the How Publicists Works episode. It really struck a chord with me. I'm an animator and I desperately wish it would be treated as a trade, which it is, and not as a high art form that requires a fancy, one hundred thousand dollar degree. Most of what I learned I actually learned on the job. Got almost nothing from my college classes, while the contacts I made in college were very valuable down the road. And nothing is quite as nice is moving out and being on your own in art school. It came with a hefty price. It is now ten years later. I've been working steadily this whole time, and I'm still paying off my college student loans and I make a good amount of money. That's just sad. And I know so many people were in the same position without but without steady work. Uh. And she says that she worked at adult Swim for a while too. By the way, Uh, there's a stigma about not going to college, and I think it's part of the reason so many people are being crushed by student loan debt. Now it's a very American stigma too. It's not I like that all around the world, stupid Americans. I think there's probably a lot of these kinds of jobs that don't need college degrees out there, like podcaster, and it might be cool to hear a podcast on that sometime. I'm not sure what you call it. Maybe how not going to college but landing a nice job and making a living anyway and sticking it to your parents works. Maybe just do one on student loans or something. Anyway, thanks for keeping the company while I animate keep it up. You guys are top notch, and that is Margie. Thanks Margie, that was a great email. Agreed. We appreciate that. And that's not college altogether. Sometimes it's very useful. Yeah. Yeah, it's just not the end all be all for everyone on the planet to have to go to college. Yeah, I know it's true. There, I mean, it's true, and I think that there hopefully is a large awakening going on because a lot of people say that the current bubble. If you're looking around for the next bubble student loans, yep, uh, yeah, we should do something about that. Sometimes, let's do it. And actually Margie gave us her um the U R L for her blog. It's m A R J I B O R D N E R dot blogspot dot com. So I imagine you can go check out her stuff there when don't you think? Yes, sir? Nice.
