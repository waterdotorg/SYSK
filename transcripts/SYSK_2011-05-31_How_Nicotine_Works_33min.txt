Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant that makes this stuff you should know? The podcast. How's it going? Man? Podcast intro Version Version one? Okay, point one? How you doing? I'm well, sir, and you're enjoying I guess we can't say a whole lot of beverage not anymore. Remember we used to just blatantly say stuff, you're enjoying a sparkling water. I can say that out of a can. Yep, frenchie, Yeah, it's good stuff. Yeah. Why are we just determined to push it to the envelope? I don't know saying in Brandon it uh it rhymes with the boy? Uh so Chuck? Yeah, you know, I was a smoker for a while. Yeah, and uh, one could make a pretty good argument that I started out at an unreasonably young aide. No, you weren't young. I was young. You weren't young. No, I was young. How old were you? Let me paint you a picture? Okay, so first time I tried a cigarette. It's in the mall. I'm young enough so that the the guy who owns the pub in the mall that has the cigarette machine that I'm buying cigarettes from, it comes out and it's like, well, you could do it. But we made off with our cigarettes and smoked one, and like the mall started spinning and everything was just crazy, right, you could smoke in the mall. Yeah, it was a while ago. Um, that was the first time. The second time was a few months later eighth grade, and um, my friends and I all decided that it was high time we started smoking. So we pull all of our mind together and ended up with enough. We figured for ten packs of cigarettes, so everybody gave me the money. I got on my bike and rode to the gas station. Rode up on my bike. Like the cashier saw me, this kid who's thirteen right up on his bike. No. Fourteen, just turned put his bike down and walk in and go, I want ten packs of cigarettes. Brands exactly. I bought like Cools, I bought Marlbro's, I bought Kent's draws like anything else. I like that. And I remember the cash here just like okay, here you go. Kidding and sent me off with a bag of ten packs of cigarettes dangling from the handlebars of my bike. It's probably like ten bucks too. It was about ten bucks back in the day. And we get back, I get back to the woods, everybody's like, oh my god, we just started smoking, and like right off the bat, I started smoking tons of cigarettes. Yeah, And I turned green, got sick, and still was like I like this a lot and smoked for twenty years and chuck. Today is April, and how many days are there in April, thirty or thirty one. I'm gonna guess thirty one. I'm gonna go with thirty one too, and I'm going to say no, thirty In three days, I may first it will be one year since i've really, wow a long time kicked it. Congratulations, I smoked too. You'd probably never even shared that with You had no idea that you smoked. Yeah. I smoked in college like everyone does here and there when I hands Yeah, but it wasn't ever anything that got its uh. Nicotine never took a hold of meat to where I needed a cigarette. It was always very much a social thing. And then when I traveled around Europe, of course I rolled my own cigarettes and thought it was just super cool. Yeah, but you know what, kids, I was not cool. I was dumb. No, I want to I want to add that to there was absolutely nothing cool about what I did. There's nothing adventurous. And many, many, many times over the course of my life, I cursed myself. I cursed that cashier and then cursed my bike for allowing me to make one of the worst decisions of my entire life that I regretted time and time and time again. You cursed Abraham Lincoln because he was on the two five dollar bills that you have to pay for it now, I think they're probably he was on the pennies that we used to pay for ten packs of cigarettes. So, um, nicotine got under my skin, chuck as it were, which is one of a few ways it can diffuse into the human body. Huh, that's right. Uh. Should we talk about tobacco just for a second here, let's at the beginning. Um, it was cultivated as early as six thousand BC. People were chewing on or inhaling tobacco. They realize, hey, this is pretty good. Yeah. Native Americans. I'm not sure what tribes they used to roll um like cigars that were several feet long, and somebody would hold it at the end, maybe another one in the middle, and you'd walk up in you puff on them like really hard and inhale until you started coughing, and then from the coughing you get light headed and supposed that you had a vision. Interesting, Well, I do know that as early as the sixteen hundreds people actually thought, you know what, this might be bad for you. And I bet you there's a link here to some of these diseases that are killing people and the smoke that we're inhaling. Yes, and I didn't know that. I had no idea it went back that far. I didn't either concerns about smoking right, and and cancer. Apparently they were aware of the cancer back then as well. Yeah, they probably call it like spirit intrusion or something instead, but yeah, they they knew that there was something too smoking. They also thought it was medicinal, which, as we'll see towards the end of this podcast, um has actually made something of a resurgence that the medicinal properties of nicotine. So this is nicotine go uh Nicotiana tobaccum. Yes, nicotine, uh Nicotiana tobaccum. What did I say no. I think that's right. Okay, I like your Latin chuck. Thank you. It's making a big comeback these days. It is so nicotine, Josh, is a liquid alkaloid. Yeah, it's the only one. Most alkaloids are white solids, really clean caffeine. Okay. I saw on a page that that nicotine is the only liquid all right, well I believe it then. Uh. It is an organic compound. Alkaloid is and it's made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sometimes a little oxygen in there and sometimes why. And nicotine makes up about five per cent of a tobacco plant if you're talking weight. But cigarettes contain between eight and twenty milligrams of nicotine per cigarette. But here's an important distinction. You only ingest about one milligram of that into your body when you smoke a cigarette. It's absorbed you ingest more, but only about a milligrams. Good point, um say it in Latin chuck absorbed um nicotine. So, like I said, nicotine got under my skin, which is one of three ways that it can be absorbed right, Yeah, through the skin, uh, into the lungs and mucus membranes like the landing of your nose and gums. And if you think who would snort tobacco, that's what snuff was and is done that too, you sniff snuff. They they still make that stuff. They do. It's a real old timy like I think. You can only find it at a like the customer service counter at a Piggy Wiggly and it's still there from the night. My grandfather's company actually made snuff in Tennessee. Your grandfather R. J. Reynolds. No, he didn't own the company, but he was like a manager of the of the workers on the floor, I think, so he exploited people. Yes, And they also made like candy, popcorn and stuff. It was weird, one of those companies that made all kinds of crazy things. It was not our gameral. So. Uh, nicotine, and we're talking about how it how it gets into your body. It's absorbed. It moves into the blood vessels that line these tissues, straight into the blood stream and then pretty much directly to the brain where it does its WAMO effects. That's right, um. Out of the ways that you can ingest nicotine into the body, the lungs are the most efficient, right, which is why their cigarettes the little right, exactly. The inhaling um nicotine through smoking tobacco, UM introduces this this drug, this alkaloid to the alveola, which are the little tiny air sacks where gas exchange occurs. And this is the fact of the podcast for me, the the alveola, right, little millions of tiny little gas bags, cute little gas bags. Um. If you combine their their surface area, the total surface area, they have ninety times more surface area than the human skin. Wow, and I imagine that's like an average size person. But still it's pretty impressive. Yeah, which again is why people smoke it. And we we're gonna say cigarettes a lot, but obviously this includes cigars and pipe smoke in any way. You're gonna ingest tobacco dip snuff if you're still doing the snuff the snuff, yeah uh so, but we're gonna say cigarettes mainly. That's fine. Okay, that's the most popular way. I believe that's right. So Josh, we said, um, here's here's an interesting thing too about the half life? Is that right? Is that how half life works? It said that nicotine has a half life of sixty minutes, so six hours after a cigarette, that one milligram that was in your body is now point oh three one. That didn't seem quite right, but I guess that is I don't know, Chuck. Well, that's what it says. So that's what we're gonna go with. Um, but how does your body get rid of this stuff? How does it process it for removal? Well? Um, several ways. Of it is broken down by your liver, right, okay, Um, some is habitalized by your lungs too and turned into uh, codine and nicotine oxide. Yeah and coddina look that up. It's an alkaloid as well, and also an anagram for nicotine. Huh. And it does pretty much the same thing as nicotine, just at a much lower potency. And alkaloids, by the way, tend to really mess with humans. Like of there's different types of alkaloids, but the under the large umbrella alkaloids you have strychnine, night shade, opium, psilocybin, hemlock or got anything that can get you wasted or kill you is an alkaloid basis right. Um. You can also get rid of cotonine um through your urine. So it takes about twenty four hours to get rid of cotonine that way, so you can actually do a nicotine p test a day after or within a day. You can also do a smell test that works too, with the breath or the clothes or the hair or whatever. Here's the fact of the podcast for me, Josh is that, Uh, some people have a genetic defect and the enzymes in their liver that the mutant enzyme is less effective at metabolizing nicotine. So some people are born able to smoke less yet retain the feeling they get from smoking longer. There's a time in my life when I would have called those people lucky. Uh yeah, well, I mean, I guess if you're gonna smoke, it's better to smoke less. But I still wouldn't should mess with it at all. Agreed, Chuck. Agreed. It's so good to hear you say these things because he used to say how much you loved cigarettes. I know, but I still I think in this one, even if I did still smoke, I would I would advise never to take it up. Um, Chuck, let's talk about the effects of nicotine. It is an alkaloid, which means it's a drug basically, um, which means it has an effect on a couple of parts of the brain, right yes, um, and not just the brain of the body. One of the first responses the body has um to nicotine is the release of adrenaline, which kicks in our dear old friend the fight or flight response, right yes, And that's initially, but can also what they call it biphasic. Yeah, it can invigorate and relax. Yeah, and that sounds a little odd until you think about like something like alcohol, which has the same qualities many times, which is why you know the girl at the bar is all fired up at first, and then later on it's why did it means? Or you know, I can't hold my head up right um? The last couple of shows, the last couple of comedy shows I've been too. There have been chatty drunk girls who have just been overly courageous in expressing what was on their mind loudly at any given moment, heckling or just too loud, but heckling but not not heckling like you're a bad meeting, just like you know, the guy would tell a joke and should be like I work at home depot and it was that like you're you're talking Bob Gold tweet right now and no idea what he's gonna do. Za Galafernakis has some classic YouTube bits dealing with hecklers. Yeah yeah, this one girl will take a slate. It's really good. Everyone I've seen, though, has done a pretty good job with these people. It's the worst part of the job, I would imagine. Um, So, chuck, you've got the release of adrenaline. Um. You. Also, we have an explanation for why people who smoke tend to eat less. Yeah, you hear oral fixation, and I imagine that that probably has a lot to do with people putting on the weight after they quit smoking. Um. But if you smoke, you can go fairly long without food. And now we understand why nicotine send some signals to your brain. Right here, let me do a little dramatic creani. So nicotine into the body. Hey, body, go ahead and dump a lot of the glucost stores in your cells into the blood stream. Okay. The body says, okay, and the nicotine says, and by the way, I don't want you releasing any insulin. Insulin absorbs glucost in the bloodstream, and the body's like okay, And then the nicotine goes Okay, Well, now that you have a bunch of glucose in your blood stream, don't you think that you've just eaten and are full and the body goes you know, I do, and the insulin exactly, And yeah, so that's called hyperglycemic And like you said, basically, it makes you feel like you're not hungry, and um, it also increases your basal metabolic rate. So you're gonna burn more calories sitting around smoking than you would if you were just sitting around. And this all sounds awesome. What I eat less and I just burn calories sitting around? It sounds awesome, but unfortunately it's not like, oh, I can lose weight smoking, and that's like exercise, because what you're actually doing is killing yourself over the long haul. And speaking of basil or basil metabolic rate, um, that is something that apparently is very overlooked when with people who exercise and count calories and things like that. How did that? I just sounded like Silvester the cat person. Um. You if you exercise and you burn five hundred calories, people are like, well, that's pretty awesome. I just burned five hundred calories. But they're not taking too account the basil metabolic rate, which is, had you just not gone to the gym and stay at home, you would have burned a hundred and fifty calories. So really you only burned three d and fifty calories. You have to take your net calorie burn to really figure out how much weight you lose exercising. Yeah, well, I don't ever look at the like on a treadmill. I don't ever pay attention to like, can you burn this many calories? Like? You know what, I gave my hard to work out for forty five minutes exactly, and I didn't fall over dead exactly. And I never weighed myself either, do you really? Yeah? I just fixed my scale actually the batteries, I'll fix it up, put a battery in it, and it had been out for like four or five months, and I didn't, you know, I felt myself getting fatter, and I weighed myself and I was actually like a pound less than I was six months ago. So it was all in my head. Well it's not great. Ideally, I'm twenty pounds less than I went six months ago. I've just been reintroduced to my hip bones lately. Yeah, that's good. You can start wearing the hip huggers you haven't noticed. Sorry, Okay, So chuck. Cigarettes will kill you is where we left off, because they will raise your bad cholesterol level, damage your arteries, and eventually you are in line for a heart attacker stroke. Yes, and that, and while we'll get into it later, let's talk about the brain. Yeah, and I don't think that's much of a spoiler. Now, cigarettes kill you. The the the irony of it is is the nicotine won't kill you. I mean, the nicotine can kill you, but you literally have to overdose on it, and it takes more than you could get from cigarettes. It's other chemicals, the thousands of other chemicals in a cigarette that kill you. Well, I'm glad you said that because that's a huge point. Um. The other chemicals are killing you. The nicotine is what makes you smoke over and over and over again. So it's a it's a one two punch of death. Well, let's talk about that. Let's talk about what happens in the brain that gets you basically addicted. Um. First up, as with anything, is the reward pathway is manipulated. Right, So, just like with cocaine or alcohol or anything like that, dopaminees released, which is how we learn how to eat and reproduce and do anything that that causes our own or our species survival. Were rewarded, right, Well, nicotine unlocks the release of dopamine, which teaches us to smoke again. Rights, right, But even more than that, a smarter neurotransmitter. And I do kind of think that dopamine is kind of a in fact, Chris Farley kind of neurotransmitter. You know, it's just kind of like out for a good time kind of thing. A setal colin. That guy is slick. That's like a Patrick Bateman kind of neurotransmitter. That's right. And nicotine docks to this uh that binds to this neurotransmitter, and that's where that's where it all happens basically, And may I interject r I P Chris Farley. I know for a fact that he was not dumb. He was a very smart guy. I was talking more about his buffoon like characters that played, not him specific. We don't want to speak ill of the dead, especially not Chris Farler. That's right. So we just mentioned the set to colleen, which the nicotine binds to this neurotransmitter. It's gonna end when you smoke, it's gonna increase the release of setal colleen. And the problem is that the set colin is great and the body, everybody loves the body regulates the release of it in the proper way, but when nicotine gets involved, it's just out of control. Willy nilly, cetoclin going crazy in your body, right, um, one of the and it's a bunch of a seal colin being released means a bunch of activity in the cholinergic neurons. Right, So the cholinergic neurons basically tell your body like, hey, you wake up, bub Let's go do something right, Let's go roller skate or something like that. Um. Cholinergic neurons also promote dopamine release, so you're up and at them. You're feeling good, you're feeling you forhork Um. You endorphins are released, which is the body's natural painkiller. You've heard of the runners high. That is h endorphins going crazy at the end of your long jog, exactly. Um. And then lastly, the thing that cements at all is the release of glutamate, which glutamate has been shown to enhance neural connections, connections between the neural pathways, which enhances memory. We talked about memory that we didn't talk about glutamate. Yeah, how do we miss that? I don't know. Well, what can happen here is if you when you ingest nicotine, glutamate can create a memory loop of how awesome it is. So now you've got this recurring film playing in your head like smoking is great, smoking is great. Have another cigarette over and over and over a deadly concoction. Yes, so that's what happens. You're you lose weight, you feel great, right, Uh, like you said, but you're slowly dying. Yes, But we mentioned earlier, Um that there there there are medicinal there's medicinal value to nicotine specifically, right, because it has this effect on your cholinergic pathways. Um, it could help with Alzheimer's. They're finding Alzheimer's is a loss of cholinergic neurons, that's right, right, which leads to memory loss, that kind of thing. You're not quite as active, You are angry and you don't know why. That's right. Um, they're finding that nicotine can help replace these or it can at the very least stop the loss of cholinergic neurons and promote the activity of the ones that are still around. That's right, hence reversing the effects of Alzheimer's or forestalling it. That's right. And Tourette syndrome is another thing they're looking into now with nicotine patches. Slowly delivering nicotine can reduce the episodes of Tourette's ticks and outbursts. So did we come? I don't even know if we covered that in turetts. This may be news to us. Do you anyone who hasn't heard Tourette sint him yet? Go back illicito. It's a good one, um, but chuck again. We want to specify that you are much more likely to die from ingesting nicotine via the current ways that we have it. We have to ingest it then you are to gain any kind of benefit, right, that's right. Cancer obviously, emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and uh, the nicotine is what gets you addicted, and all the thousands of chemicals and the cigarette is what kills you. And it will kill you. I mean, if you smoke your whole life, you're very much a rarity. If you're one of those people that's like smoking for fifty years and not suffering any effects. That's that's really rare. Sometimes I feel death over my shoulder. Really now you're healing, man. You can you can reverse the effects. That's what's so good about it. Yeah, you can reverse the effects, but you can also do lasting damage well, all sorts of time bombs in your body after smoking thousands and thousands of cigarettes over twenty years. True, but you're you're doing good, buddy, um So, Chuck, we talked about it being psychologically addictive, right, very much. You do it compulsively. The definition of this is you are compulsively engaging in an activity that you know will harm you. Yes, you're still doing it. Yes, And it is physiologically anything. Neuroscientists basically say anything that that uh synthetically turns on your reward pathway is addictive, and that's cigarettes for sure. Um or nicotine specifically. And we also mentioned chuckers that um nicotine itself is harmful if you overdose on it. Yeah, but it's very difficult to overdose on it because we remember there's eight to twenty milligrams with nicotine and a cigarette, but your body only jests about one. It's very difficult to overdose by way of smoking inhalation. It is, but if you're a baby and you're dumb, you can eat cigarettes or cigarette butts and overdose on it. It doesn't take very much. It can take eating one cigarette can send a baby to the hospital with a lot of problems. Yes, and I looked this up and it says so in this article, but I double checked the adults. If you eat like three to seven cigarettes as an adult, you will likely die. So don't do that. Don't ever eat a cigarette for any reason. No, But I remember we talked about um ambient people on and in Waking Up and cigarettes, and I was surprised. I thought it was like, oh, eat like three packs of cigarettes and you might get really sick. But if you eat four or five six cigarettes, you will likely die if you don't get to a hospital. So there. This all reminds me of a story of I hope somebody out there can help me with this. It was in a feature article in g Q sometime between probably nineteen nine and n okay, okay. It was about a bank robber may I. He was one of the more successful bank robbers of all time because he figured out if you put a clown wig on glasses and then dangle ribbons from the glasses. No one will ever be able to give a good description of you, ever. So here's a very successful bank robber for a while. What about his wearing a mask? I don't know that was his though. This guy finally gets napped, right, and he's in prison, and he decides he needs to get out, so he takes a pack of cigarettes, right that I imagine he traded a few honeybutons for um. He unrolls the cigarettes and puts him in a cup of water. Let's a couple of water sit overnight, goes around out into the prison yard during like exercise time, runs around a couple of times. It comes back in and immediately chugs this cup of nicotine water of tobacco water and falls right over right. So the hospitals like we are the prisons like we gotta get this guy at the hospital. Well, the ambulance that shows up is full of paramedics who pulled guns on the prison guards. Get the guy into the back of the ambulance. It's his gang posing his paramedics. They take him to an underground doctor who revives him and he lives is that that really happened According to this g Q article and my memory of the g Q article, that's what happened. We could find that out of bet but we can explain exactly what they would have treated him with to to overcome this nicotine overdose which he was surely suffering. We can now, well, what would they treat him with? Well, there's a couple of things you could do. You could get the You could get the nicotine out by giving them ipcac something to induce vomiting. Yeah, um, which you would probably want to do. You can also give them activated charcoal, which the carbon will attract the nicotine the alkaloids, and it will keep the body from absorbing more of it. But that's basically what you want to do is to get out whatever you can and make sure nobody eats any more nicotine. Yeah, and I guess the only scenario no one would want to do that is the the sleepy, hungover morning after when you reach over and grab what you think is that cup of soda and it's really the thing that all your cigarette butts were there into. I knew a kid who would still drink beer with cigarette butts in it. Yeah, smart guy. Uh so I'm not talking about of course you're not. Um so nicotine, Like we said, it gets in your body. Like any drug, your body will adapt adapt, adapt to that drug and start behaving differently. So that's why when you quit, just like any drug, your body's gonna say, wait a minute, Like I was functioning on a certain level here. Uh, and now you just took the nicotine away. So I don't know what to do right. I'm used to a certain amount of color colinergic activity. Give it to me. So I'm gonna be really messed up for a while, and you're gonna be really irritable. Um, Mr person who who has my body? And uh, you're gonna be anxious, and you're gonna be depressed, and you're gonna crave me a lot for about a month and beyond. But a month physically, they say, is when it kind of will leave your system. But the psychological part. I know some people that quit smoking for a decade and they still craved that cigarette on occasion. I used to. I would meet people here there who would you know who saw me smoking? Like I quit thirty years ago and I still want a cigarette every day, And it scared me because I'm kind of like, I think I'd rather die than go like live like that, you know, And now I understand what they're talking about. Where it's like you, it's so manageable. It's such a passing thought that I don't I don't have it every day, but I mean I have had it where I'm like, it would be really greattte probably having a drink that for a lot of people alcohol in cigarettes you would think. So, No, I haven't noticed any actual triggers. Um, there is a lot of it is association, like yes, if you if you drink, you want it. You want a cigarette that doesn't it's fleeting. It's more kind of out of the blue, not like stress related, not necessarily interesting. It's just kind of they're like and like underneath a certain part of your brain and it just kind of floats to the service every once a while, but you just kind of batted away. It's completely manage about you. Yeah, well that's good. It's different for everybody, and um, the way it reacts in your body is different for everyone. Your tolerance level is going to be different, uh for everybody. That's why some people smoke three packs a day is because they need to keep recharging that hit of dopamine. And some people can get by with smoking the occasional cigarette, and our advice is to not ever start, avoid the whole mess. Yeah, and this is coming from a dude who love to smoke. And now you're just like, no, no, no, no, that's great. I love it, Thanks, Chuck. Um. If you love nicotine and you want to learn more about it, if you love it at an intellectual level, I guess that is what I mean. If you can learn more by typing in nicotine, right, Yes, I imagine you could also type in coded nine if you wanted to in in the search bar at how stuff works dot com, which will bring up this article on nicotine, and search bar brings up listener mail. That's right, you almost caught me off guard. That was so slick, Uh, Josh, I'm gonna call this uh follow up on wacky Wills. Yes, we asked for wacky will stories and this was a good one. This is from Nate in Galesburg, Illinois. Dear Josh and Chuck and Jerry, guys have been a big fan for years. I heard how wills work. I was hoping you would mention my favorite story of strange will stipulations. But you didn't so here it is uh And he included a link to Snopes because it's uh true. Yeah, he wasn't the only one to send this one into Oh did more than one of these come in? So? A Toronto lawyer named Charles vance Millar died in with a hefty estate. Left a number of strange clauses in his will, most of which are described in the link, the strangest of which is came to be known as the Great stork derby wacky Canadians. He left a significant portion of his money investment that would turn out to be worth up to seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the woman who gave birth to the most children in Toronto. And it's in years following his death. Oh this guy to do that? I don't know. I'm really trying to think of a reason he was. Um, he was a big fan of coitus maybe or just trying to populate Canada. I guess take over the US once and for all? Is it toront that's what he says. Uh. There were a number of interesting legal challenges highlighted in the link, such as whether or not illegitimate or deceased children counted. It's awful, and ultimately the purse was split among six women in total, the most money going to four women with nine legitimate live burse during the time frame, each of whom received the hundred and twenty five grand I hope you guys have a chance to mention this uncommon and capreaches equipment from Nate in Galesburg and uh quickly. We also wanted to mention Chris uh is a marine. Was a marine and then later a Naval reserve officer, and they were required to have a will, so we mentioned the on the battlefield type of holographic will or oral will and apparently now you have to prove that you have a will to get into the armed services. So that's that's the information we got from Chris. Thanks Chris. And I can't remember the name of the person who sent us an email and uttered dis the leap that we failed to mention Brewster's millions, but my apologies to that person and anyone else who thought the same thing. Yeah, we totally overlooked that. That's Lesser Prior's good.
