Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of five Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, there's Charles W. Bryant, and there's Jerry Woosh Roland over there is just getting worse and worse. This is Stuff You Should Know podcast wind Tunnel a dish m Aren't you glad we're not in the same room so that you couldn't smell my breath When I went, yeah, my daughter's gotten a bad habit of doing that, and she thinks it's funny. I'm like, it's really not of what of like breathing and someone's nose on purpose, like right in your face, and like no one, no one likes that. Yeah, she's she's just entered the age of what five to where that's something people do. Yeah, not not funny. Ever, I'll tell you what. These masks that we're all wearing, this is a real reckoning with your breath. THO wouldn't it? Oh my god, it's funny. It's like a it's like an hour by our slide into despair. You're like, I don't remember eating garlics. Yeah, it's like in the morning is like, oh man, this is great, and I love this mask. And later in the day you're you need that toothbrush. Yes, it's true. They say you can't smell your own breath and they are wrong. And I'm brushing my teeth now more than other because I'm scared to go to the dentist. Yeah. Same here. I'm also flossing like a mad person too. You're flossing right now, I can, I can hear it. Wow, that was the most pc thing I've ever said, is what I'm flossing like a mad person, not a madman. And technically, I guess not. I would have said like a mentally ill health person. Yeah, I think that's even bad. Who knows these days, right, that's right. Let's talk about wind tunnels. Okay, so we're talking wind tunnels. Um, and I had no idea how interesting wind to thos were. I had an inkling that they were going to that there was like more to wind tunnels than people realize, which is absolutely true. Um, but they're they're pretty, they're deep cut. Yeah, I mean there was way there's way more to them, and you can do way more with them and learn way more from them than I thought because my experience with wind tunnels. Like most people is seeing the cool TV commercial with the with the like green smoke flying over the car to demonstrate how aerodynamic it is. And to be sure, that is a very big part of what they use wind tunnels for. Yeah. Yeah, and Chuck, you know, you and I were in a commercial in a wind tunnel. I thought you might bring this up. That was a wind tunnel. Technically that that um indoor skydiving thing is a type of wind tunnel. It's a vertical wind tunnel. Yeah, if you guys haven't seen that. It's been a while since we promoted these things. We used to do these little shorts. Um no, this was different. Well no, but these were based on the shorts. Yeah. Yeah, we did these little shorts that we called interstitials. Did a lot of them, and to me, it's like the best video work we've ever done as a team. Um, I love don't be done. But that was just you. Um well, it was great. It was you in the room and it was this chair and you sort of played a character. Yes, go on, And some people have problems with the character because I thought you were making fun of a certain kind of person. Sure, that wasn't true. It was all very kind hearted and just funny. That was really great, Thank you. Sure. Uh and that chair still here in the office, right, Yes it is, and I believe my outfit still is. I'm waiting for the Smithsonian calm. So. Yeah. We did this um TV commercial for Toyota that was very much in the vein of those interstitials where we were in just all over Atlanta, in various parts of Atlanta doing funny things. That was l A. Remember well, no, this was again talking about the original interstitiause I'm so confused. Then when we went to l A, we did the same thing. We replicated that style in Los Angeles and long the upshot of this all is we end up in a indoor uh skydiving facility having a conversation like you know, a normal conversation or trying to That was the gig, the gig. That was the gag. That was the bit. Yeah, and you get slung against the side of it at the end, which is kind of the funniest part. Yeah, it really really was. It was supposed to be an outtake and they made it an intake. Those things were very difficult to uh if you've never done one before. There, I mean, it was fun and kind of cool, but it's not easy. You don't just go in there and be like, hey, I'm floating. No, it's really really hard actually, yeah, like you're working every muscle in your body. It's kind of like water skiing looks fun too. Yeah you were good at it. I was not very good. I was okay, but it was it was tough. Yeah. So, um, that was what would be technically called a vertical wind tunnel, right, And they actually used those two to research spin. Um, Like, when something goes in, uh, like a tail spin, like a helicopter goes in a tailspin, they would use a vertical wind tunnel to test for that kind of thing. Right. But the wind tunnels we kind of more think of are the horizontal tubes where you see a car or something like that having the cool smoke blown over it for a commercial. But they're very useful. Um, and this is something I didn't really know I kind of I kind of just thought they were all these big giant things that you would put an actual car in. Most wind tunnels are these little desktop models that you use in a science lab that have a scale model that you're using instead of the actual thing, right, which which means, yeah, that you're using a smaller version, but that is precisely scaled down. It looks the right size, doesn't quit. I'm sure this plane will fly, this is close enough. But what's neat about that is that they can scale this thing down. They can subject it to, you know, the same conditions as they would a full size model. But then they can correct for the data for that whatever with the numbers they're getting the output, they can correct to scale it back upwards. Um, just using math. Because if there's one thing that goes hand in hand with wind tunnels, it is math, friends, Because the whole point of wind tunnels is to study aerodynamics, which is the flow of air or gas is over an object. Um And in this case it's a stationary object and the wind is moving. But what they're really doing is simulating that object moving out there in the real world into wind. And I mean, that's a wind tunnel. And when you put it like that, it sounds very simple. They are not simple at all. There's really nothing about wind tunnels that's simple, from their construction, to their cost, to what they're used for, to all of the different variables and conditions that they can test for there they grew step in step, hand in hand with the aviation industry, Like we probably wouldn't have an aviation industry right now without wind tunnels. Um and that should kind of give you an idea of how complex the stuff that people are doing in wind tunnels is, or the data they're extracting from these wind tunnels tests. It's not just like, look that cool green smoke bending over the car. That's for for yokels like you and I watching ads while you know, in between golf, you know, like you're watching golf and the ad comes on my brain. Is the best part of golf, The ads I've actually kind of gotten. Are you watching golf now? Yeah? Kind of here there. It's not something I seek out. But and it's not for the golf. I could care less about the golf. It's the it's the views, it's the shots. The golf courses are just they have the most amazing backdrops and it's just so tranquil and calm. It's really something. Yeah, you know, I live right down the street from the legendary East Lake Country Club in Atlanta, Bobby Jones Course, and been to one day of that one tournament. That's the only time I've actually been to a professional golf tournament and you know, I stood there twelve feet from Tiger Woods and the tea box is pretty pretty neat. Wow, like just to see because I played golf a lot growing up and it's a hard sport and to see someone do it uher perfectly right in front of your face with that much power, was it was. It was really impressive. You know what, what would really help Tiger Woods swing if they put him in a wind tunnel, put some green smoke in the wind and watch them swing. They could tell him how to do it better. You want smoke him smoke that's right, that's right. Shout out to our Guard Detroit crew from the day. Al Right, So if you want to go back in time and talk about human flight, you're gonna look at things like Da Vinci's ornithopter and kind of a lot of early stabs at flying were humans looking at birds and thinking, well, if we're gonna fly, we're gonna have to learn how to flap wings really fast. And it made sense. I guess if you're looking at birds, they're the only thing flying around. Uh, it would make sense that that's where they would go. But they knew early on, regardless of the flapping, that they needed to understand wind and how wind worked with wings. And so they started going to these little hills and mountains and they started going to caves that had you know, they were looking for some sort of predictable, constant wind so they could do some early testing. And they realized, you just can't do it with mother nature. You can't get a consistent wind, not enough to get real data out of it and do that math that we need so so drastically to make this possible. Right so, and and initially we got that assist from birds and that we knew wings had to be involved. That the whole flapping thing really kind of threw things off for a while. But because we knew that there had to be wings, we knew that there had to probably be some ideal or optimum shape of wings. And that's really where wind tunnels first got their start, wasn't testing different shape of wings or air foils. And there was a guy back in seventeen forty six named Benjamin Robbins who created a wiry arm um, which is basically like a It was a centrifuge basically is what he created. He had a hard time picturing this, and there's only there's this one very rudimentary sketch that made it even more confusing. Okay, so just just imagine you have like a pole coming out of the ground vertically and you have an arm attached to that pole, and the pole can spin around in a circle like a centrifuge, like one of those G force testers that they have at and like, um, like astronaut training, you know what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that thing. This is what that guy invented. But it was like with wood and in the dirt. It wasn't and it didn't go that fast. But you could have fixed a like a wing type that you were testing to see if it worked well to the end of it and push it through the air. And it didn't really help this guy figure out what wings style or size was the best. What it helped him figure out is that it doesn't have that much to do with anything with flapping. We don't need to be wasting our time inventing machines that that flap their wings, because that's not it. It's all about this thing called lift and drag and the proportion between those two. And if you can figure out how to get more lift and decreased drag. Then you can you can really make some you can fly basically, And this was the very first inklings of that that Benjamin Robbins came came up with. Yeah, and what I saw was that Robbin's really kind of pinpointed drag, like the shape is super important. And then after him, Sir George Cayley had his own whirling arm and he's the one that really figured out lift was a key. After they realized the shape of the thing matters the um more than the shape, like the size of it matters. Size does matter, especially when you're flying, especially when you're flying, and uh that if you could just get a quick enough takeoff, you don't need to flap at all. All you need is a lot of speed at first, which they could have also gotten frankly by if they would have kept looking at birds and realized they eventually stopped flapping, they might have realized, oh, you actually don't need to flap the whole time. You can glide if you've got enough speed, right and and well, actually a lot of the early flying machines were gliders. It was one of the the Wright brothers were not the first people to UM engage in in human flight. There is a monk named Elmer of Malmsberry who has the first recorded human flight back in ten fifty c E not b C and um he he You know, that was almost a thousand years before the Right Brothers UM. But the Right Brothers are credited with with UM the like an engine powered flight human flight. Right, So they they were dabbling in what's what Kaylee and Robbin's well, Kaylee especially figured out that you need thrust and there's just nothing around that's light enough to produce enough thrust. So Kaylee actually gave up and went and joined parliament for a while before he finally created a flying machine. Fifty years before the Right Brothers. He made his UM. He made his coach driver test pilot it, and the coach driver was so scared even though the flight was successful that when he landed he was like, I quit, I quit. I'm not. I don't work for you anymore. Yeah, but George Kayley's very much overlooked figure in the history of flight. He apparently figured out the general shape um of a modern airliner back in Yeah. Alright, I say we take a break, we'll come back and talk about the first wind tunnel right after this. Alright, so Kaylee has these whirling arms going terrible name, but it worked out. Uh. Then enter a man named Frank h Win him. He was another Englishman and he was in the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, and he said, guys, we need or excuse me, gentlemen, we need a wind tunnel, and we need it bad. And so in eighteen seventy one he had the very first wind tunnel. Was twelve ft long, about eighteen inches square, with a forty mile wind, which is pretty good. It was. It consisted of your daughter going, oh god, stinky has went dunne her breath. Isn't that stinky yet? Kids don't really start to stink until later, I think, yeah, until later. But the winds were powered by a steam fan at the end of the tunnel, and it worked pretty well. He was able to get that leading edge of the airfoil and move it up and down and change his angle angle of attack and kind of see what shaped, uh and what angles worked best with to get the best lift. But it was still sort of choppy, and it was rough around the edges. And if you really want to make this you know, if you want to fly safely, you got to have a really really really consistent, very smooth wind to work with to get that data. And they still didn't have one at this point. Now they still didn't, but they were advancing by leaps and bounds here that people were building their own wind tunnels. Because up to that point, if you had in a design for an airfoil, for like a wing size or shape, you had to build it and then go take it out into nature and test it and hope for the best, and it was really expensive, really time time consuming. With your own wind wind tunnel, you could make a model of the shape and test it out yourself and then see this is actually worth pursuing, or this as junk, and that's it. That's what our dear beloved heroes, the Right brothers did in Ohio outside of Dayton, Lorville and Wilbur Wright Um built their own wind tunnel. These guys were just like tinkerers. They owned a bike shop, but they were so fascinating were following these developments in early flight that they just kind of got into it themselves and they built themselves a wind tunnel. They had like two different or two hundred different types of wings. I believe that they messed with selected the thirty best ones that they had developed in their wind wind tunnel of their own construction and design um And apparently I saw somewhere that by nine one, after their wind tunnel tests, the Right Brothers, a couple of bicycle repairment in Dayton, had the world's um most accurate data scientific data on on flying and wings in the world. And they'd come up with it entirely by themselves. Yeah, and here's the thing with these wind tunnels, especially early on in kind of still, it's not like they could use that wind tunnel and come out with a surefire product using math and uh and testing different designs and shapes and tilts and angles. But it was such a time saver and broken bone saver that you didn't just say, all right, well, I think this might work. Let's go and push our cousin off of a cliff or our coach driver or whatever and see if it works. They still had their failures, all of them did, But I mean it would have taken I mean, god knows how many more years if they didn't, like at least start from a point of likely success thanks to wind tunnels. But I mean, like, look at it. They went from they finished their wind tunnel tests in nineteen o one, they had their first powered flight in en three. Yeah, I mean that's so it's amazing two years and it definitely did accelerate it too. And so you can see from the outset that that aviation and wind tunnels just developed together, and wind tunnels developed aviation um. But the first wind tunnels, like you said, they had a really big problem, and that was the air that they produced. The stream of wind was very choppy, very turbulent, and your data was not necessarily reliable. It wasn't too terribly much better than say, going out into mother Nature and subjecting you know, the same model to those winds um And that's a big problem. So one of the first things that they figured out how to do was to make the wind smoother so that you could get a reliable, smooth, steady wind um in your wind tunnel whenever you wanted to use it. Yeah, and that's where we come to the modern tunnel, very very smooth airflow. And they have five basic sections of and they're you know, they're all different, but they have five basic sections. In a modern tunnel that's the settling chamber, the contraction cone, the test section, the diffuser, and the drive section. So we start out with this swirling air and it's a big choppy mess and it enters the tunnel and we'll talk about how in a second, because it's kind of cool, little counterintuitive, but it makes a lot of sense. Um it goes into the settling chamber, which does exactly what you think. It settles that air, straightens it out. They might have these little honeycomb holes or a screen or these panels, and that's just sort of the initial thing to sort of get it nice and smooth and moving in the same uniform direction. Yeah, and then it goes down. They step it down through that contraction cone, and that just I mean, it's like anything else. If you make the the tube smaller, it's going to increase that velocity of air flow. And that's where it gets to the test section, which is whatever. And the test section depends on what you're testing. If it's a desktop thing, the test section might be twelve inches long and you might have a tiny little model of an airplane wing in there, and that's where the actual thing you're testing is and where all the sensors are record all the data because you know, you've got your visual that you've got these windows so you can shoot TV commercials and you can look at the thing. But there's also all manner of sensors to pick up on all manner of UH data and observations. Yeah, I think that's really cool that they still you know, when they operate wind tunnels, they still watch through the window because there's a lot to be gained visually from from just human beings watching this stuff, and so you want to you want to watch it right, Yeah, for sure, especially when they got the green smoke thing turned on. So after it goes through the um, the test section enters a diffuser UM which kind of it slows things, slows things down UM and maybe just exits the whole thing. It's kind of the opposite of the contractor it just opens back up right exactly. So there's UM, there's there as far as breaking. There's a lot of different kinds of wind tunnels, as we'll see, but there's really kind of two categories too, broad categories. You've got open and closed circuit, and an open circuit is where you have wind going in on one end, going through the diffuser and the honeycomb in the test section and then coming out the other end blowing into the room and another with the closed circuit. It's just basically an oval and so when the wind is generated, it goes through the it goes through the test section out the back, but then bends around an oval track and then comes back around again and through the contraction coning into the test section again and again, and can just keep going rather than just blowing out the other side. Yeah, and here's the part that I said wasn't intuitive, but it's really kind of neat when you think about it. The drive section is where this fan is, and this is what it's just generating that air flow. And I always just thought a wind tunnel was a fan pointing at the thing. They're actually behind the thing, because you don't want to push air onto something, you want air being pulled over something. And it it just makes total sense, but you ever really thought about it, You just I always just pictured a big fan blowing at a car, but the fan would actually be behind the car and it's probably looping around and smoothing out this entire way and then being gently pulled over the car exactly. And in just the same way that the fastest way to cool off, say like a server room that you don't have good cooling on, you just throw a box fan the opposite way. So the boxman is blowing out into the regular room, but at the same time it's sucking the air, the hot air out of the out of the server room, and cool air is rushing into a place that hot air. So you're creating like an air flow that's much less turbulent. When the fan sucks the air out, it's much smoother than when it blows it in, which creates a lot more turbulence. And that was the big problem that was facing like the Right Brothers and some of those other early wind tunnel creators, is they their fans were blowing on the front of their models rather than having the fan behind it sucking the air over the models. Right. So these little models they're kept in place, sometimes around wire, sometimes around these middle poles. Uh sometimes I think they really super high tech ones use um super strong magnets to actually hold them in place, which is pretty cool. And then again you've got all these sensors all over the place attached to the model measuring I mean, we'll see it gets really really deep. But just at the outset you can measure like wind velocity and air pressure and temperature, and if you're talking about airplanes, roll and yaw and drag and lift, and I mean, you can kind of do anything you want in there. And if you have, like if you're testing an airplane or a scale model of the airplane you're gonna build, it's on something called the sting, which is a pole basically that goes into the airplanes bottom. But but then inside the airplane, the airplane is not attached to the pole. It's attached to something called a balance. And it's like all those sensors you just mentioned all in one instrument, like a cylinder tube, and as the airplane moves and pitches and yaws and rolls and and gallops and all that stuff, not gallops, So I made that part up. UM, it's it's acting on those sensors and the motion, the mechanical motion on those sensors is translated into an electrical impulse and that travels down the stinger into the computers which are picking up all of this data in real time and UM logging it and creating new new versions of the UH the model based on that stuff. It's pretty amazing. What's even more amazing that makes sense that that exists today, That's existed since like the forties or the fifties, and in much more primitive form, but essentially the same thing that we use today, the same kind of balance what has been around for decades. Wasn't there a Simpsons joke about y'all control? Yes, yeah, when they had one of those like backyard pockets now with yaw control and didn't like buzz Aldrin or something, say like, wow, look at that y'all control. I think so that was good stuff. Uh. Some other things that they measure, which you might not really think about existing is viscosity and compressibility, or the tackiness or the bounciness of the air itself. So when you're thinking about air blowing over a car driving down the road, you don't think of that air is like being sticky necessarily. But when that air is moving over the hood of that car, in the top of that car or the plane or whatever it is, Uh, those little molecules are gonna hit the surface and just very very briefly, they're going to cling to that surface, and that even for that brief brief amount of time. It's gonna create a little boundary layer of air next to the thing that you're trying to measure air flow over. Yeah, which is, like I said, a very big deal. And and yeah, an individual air molecule is going to stick for a nano second, just some ridiculously short amount of time. But there's so many air molecules that they essentially just replace each other as fast as they can move. And yes, they create this this this boundary layer. And as far as aerodynamics is concerned, your your say, your car blow go like driving through this wind that's that's sticking to it um now has a different shape. That boundary layer creates a different shape or extends it outward beyond the actual physical shape of the car. And so, yes, very much so. And then so so when you're trying to test like how fast the car is going to go, how many miles per gallon it's going to get that kind of stuff. That boundary layer makes a tremendous amount of difference because it changes physically changes the shape of this this thing when it's out there traveling at high speeds. So one of the great benefits of an air tunnel is you can test, like, what boundary layer is produced by this particular shape of this car under this condition. You know, if it's um humidity, but you know forty degrees ferrent height. Uh, and they're traveling at eighty miles an hour, what kind of boundary layers produced? Okay, well what about seventy five an hour at the sixty percent humidity. You can just change all these variables, and the wind tunnel allows you to simulate it in in in Basically, UM, get all this data in real time. UM. Just lickety split basically. Although one other thing, I just want to say this, we're making it sound like this is fast. This is actually, and has been, especially until the age of computers, very arduous work. Because if you wanted to change one variable, if you said, well, this headlight is actually causing way too much drag, you would have to switch that headlight out with your next model and run the same tests over and over and over again with the different different um conditions and log all that data. So it was really arduous before computers, and you kind of get the idea that aerodynamics as a field of study is really given over to computation. Like there has been a huge savior for that field and helped it along and saved a lot of people a lot of time. Yeah, and you mentioned things like humidity and temperature um. There are all different kinds of wind tunnels, and they can be very specific as to what they want to test or very broad, but they're they're all able to do things like that. You can dial in a temperature, you can dial in um atmospheric pressure if you want to see what something' is like on Mars, which they have to do if you want, like the Mars Rover to be successful. They can. They can ice up a plane wing just by introducing refrigerated air and spraying a mist of water that freezes and lands on the wing, and you can simulate all these different things humidity and temperature, And it's just amazing that that they thought to to introduce. You know, at first they started out probably just looking at aerodynamics of flow over a thing, but as they got more and more specific with their needs, they just said, you know that we can design these tunnels to kind of do anything we want to do, like recreate any and vironment you can think of. Basically, Yeah, it's true, and I mean like as as we started to build planes that go faster and faster. We started building tunnels that simulated that really high speed travel, and so we have hypersonic and supersonic um wind tunnels that don't use fans at all, but they use like bursts of compressed air that blow right onto the model. Those do blow at the thing instead of sucking behind it. Right. Um. But it's it's a huge release of of air that is traveling so fast it simulates you know, like a jet flying through you know, hundreds of you know, millions of miles an hour probably yeah, or hey, what's it like for a rocket human capsule too, uh to come back into Earth's atmosphere at the and and not burn up like they can simulate those temperatures. Yeah, there's one in I think North Carolina. No University of Texas at Arlington has something that can simulate that goes up Torees Ferren. It's crazy, man, it is. It's a wind tunnel for all in times of purpose. It's a wind tunnel. But they have built these things so that they can simulate basically any any climate. And you know, we talked about smoke, and it's always fun in those TV commercials to see the smoke blowing over the thing. And it's a nice visual to sell cars that look super aerodynamic in our super aerodynamic. But that visible flow isn't just you know, for the stoners in the lab department, like late at night to play around with, although they probably do that, but they flow visualization is a real technique. Um, you might just have colored smoke, you might have liquid, like a mist of liquid. You might have they use this colored oil sometimes that uh you can see like the wind pushing the oil along the surface of whatever model you're using, and then they've got these high speed cameras capturing all of it. And again it's just, um, it's another variable they can actually look at rather than just using numbers and data. Yeah, I saw one, um one was taking photographs of like two thousand frames per second. That speed it was, but it was they were testing like a rocket or something or model of it. Should we take a break, Yeah, let's all right. We'll be right back with more on wind tunnels right after this. So Chuck, I was like a lot of this really breaks my brain. It's one of those things we're like, oh yeah, I totally get this on the surface. Let me scratch a little deeper. I don't understand this at all. And the reason why is because you know, aerodynamics requires a lot of math and formula and all sorts of calculations that I'm not contrated that I'm not currently capable of doing that. But one of the things that I tried to shake down was when you do a scale model of something, do you have to scale down the conditions? And it turns out I wasn't the first one to think about this. Other people have, including people who work in wind tunnels, and apparently they do not do that. They will say, subjected to the same wind speed as they would like the full size one, but then they go back and use math to adjust um these that all the different variables and again, you know, we talked about pitch and y'all, role um, drag lift, all sorts of stuff. I'm sure quite a few things and variables that you and I haven't even come up with um or run across during our research. But in each one of these interacts with each other thing, right, So it's like one of those things where you know you have a eleven possible hoppings for a pizza and that creates twelve million potential combinations. It's a brain breaking amount of math involved exactly. So that's what they're doing. To scale it down and scale it up. They can say, oh, well, it produced this data. If we run it through these these you know, formula um like, we can show that actually, like it will have this effect in the in the real world. They're using that level of math. Anybody who can do that with math, I admire them deeply. If you're listening out there and you can do stuff like that with math, my hat is off to you because I will never be able to do that, and I admire you. Yeah, And you know what, we've taken some heat for kind of beating up on math a little bit is like boring because we were English and journalism guys and history guys. But uh, I've really come to appreciate math and doing this show. I'm no better at it and don't care to be, but I appreciate the You know, math is the one thing that doesn't care about what you think about it. It doesn't care about opinions, and there's no interpretation or nuance. It's just it's just math. And like what makes like to look at these to look at a math equation that would take a model of an airplane and a tiny little thing and a tiny wind tunnel and then say, well, now we just scale it up to this, and this is how you do it right, just multiplied by time. It makes me so nervous, But a real mathematician would be like, this is the last thing you should ever be nervous about, because it's it's just math. It's just right there. Well, it's just and they probably the idea of them of doing public speaking would probably scare the Jesus. And the thing is exactly like, different things attract different people, and that's great because that makes the world a lot more rich and complex that you have all these different people. If everyone was in the math, it would be a pretty boring place, or if everybody hated math would be a pretty boring place to Like, you need all different kinds, different strokes for different folks. Makes the world go round, I think, is the rest of them. All. Right, Let's talk about some of these wind as in the world, because they're amazing. NASA has one at Ames Research Center in San Jose or near San Jose, biggest in the world, biggest one hundred and eighty feet tall, dude four hundred feet long, and the test section on this thing is eight ft tall and a hundred twenty ft wide, so you can put a full size jet plane in that thing. Yeah. I saw that. I was like, well, what kind and they said seven thirty seven. Yeah, that's pretty good that kind, buddy, pretty pretty good size. So yeah, that's a I don't know if they call it this, but I hear here henceforth call it the Big Man with jam. Yeah. It uses six four story high fans, each of which is powered by six two thousand, five hundred horsepower motors. Six fans each as tall as a four story building. That man, that's amazing. A hundred and fifteen mile in our winds is where it tops out, yeah, which is pretty great. Um that there's also a lot apparently. I was reading one, um uh, some like blog posts I think on like a Formula one site, and they were talking about how like every single company, every single racing team has in its facility of full size wind one like it can hold a full size Formula one car the cost of like six million dollars or whatever. But they are um like cutting edge as far as um aerodynamic study is concerned. UM. And the reason why is because like if you can shave a second off of somebody's time just by reconfigure the engineers reconfiguring the shape of a fin or a tail or something like that. That's that you just it just paid for itself basically because it may have just one like the you know, good job there, Yeah, thank you. So there are NASCAR's obviously obviously got a couple of these things in North Carolina. The home of NASCAR Aerodin wind Tunnel. UM that is in North Carolina, and it tests full sized stock cars. There's no one called wind shear there. Um. This is a closed circuit tunnel that actually has a treadmill in it for cars. It's got a built in rolling road. Yeah, saw that in a few places, like BMW has one with the rolling road. You know what's interesting to me too, is so we saw that the aviation industry and UM and wind tunnels kind of grew hand in hand. The auto industry didn't really look up wind tunnels until about the fifties is when they really started running their cars through those, and they went, boy, these cars are not aerodynamic. Now look at it. Look at that yaw control. Though. Yeah, I love those old cars. Though I used my old Plymouth Valiant that I used to have. Um. This is obviously way before anyone ever thought of anything like anti lock breaks. And one of the most fun things I would do when I was driving with friends on an empty road late at night was get up to about fifty miles an hour and just slam on the brakes. It was so much fun, man, it was great. You would just go. You would slide about a hundred feet before finally coming to arrest. That was a great impression of slamming on the brakes too, by the way, it was good and you know it. It was like we called it the sled because it was just this big, heavy hunk of metal. It's not like I was sliding all over the road. I was just sliding very straight in a line. What's the opposite of aerodynamic that Plymouth Valiant? There you go, um, sluggish like a what sponge? Yeah, that's about right. So UM, I think we should wrap this up on the future of wind tunnels because people have been saying like, well, wind tunnels are are dead. Now we've got computational fluid dynamics, which is basically computers can figure all this out if you put a shape into you know, auto CAD and say, computer, figure out what you know will happen if I try to fly this under these conditions, It'll tell you um. And they people have said, well, you know, it takes a lot of work and a lot of money to run and build and use wind tunnels. UM. So I think they're probably going away people who work in wind tunnels saying no, to not do away with the wind tunnels. We need them still because yes, computation UM helps a lot with the early work, but when you finally have something that you need to prove, you really kind of want to see it in real life to make sure. Yeah, you want to see that smoke yourself. UM. And you know computer simulations can't simulate green smoke very well. You've got to see that in real life. So they they're saying that this is complementary technology and that they really we need to keep our wind tunnels around because we still need them. Yeah. And I think we'd also be remiss if we didn't say it's not just um vehicles and seeing how like a space shuttle or a car or a plane or a dune buggy might might run in the wind. Um. If you want to see how airflow if X like a computer U and components in a computer, you can yeah, good point, like how they come, how they cool computer chips. If you want to figure out the very best design for a wind turbine or wind farm, then you can use air tunnels. Um. There are lots of other different uses that you don't think about just on kind of everyday products. Sometimes. Yeah, there's a I have to say, there's a a Virginia Tech. There's an ann echoic, an echoic I believe, wind tunnel where they test wind turbines to see what kind of noise they're going to make. And they have so the walls are as far as the wind is concerned, it has four walls, but as far as sound is concerned, it has three because one of the walls is made of kevlar, so wind won't go through it, but sound will code right through it like it's not even there. So they can take accurate measurements of what's going to happen when the wind hits this turbine, what kind of sound is it going to make? And they're making the country folk who live among wor wind turbines much happier. That's awesome. Yeah, So that's it for wind tunnels, everybody. There's probably more to it, but it's far, far beyond chucks or my grasp. So again, hats off to all the aerodynamicists in all of their maths. Ah. If you want to know more about wind tunnels, go check stuff out on the internet. I hear there's a man with the page boy haircut who does a pretty mean demonstration. No no, no, that's just the printing press. Okay, I thought he was a factotum. He might be renaissance man. Um. Well, since I said renaissance man, everybody, it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this on Wetlands. And this is one from Brian from Queens and this is very cool. I didn't realize this. There was a a music venue in New York when I used to live up in New Jersey called Wetlands that I would go to, and I never knew that was kind of a cool story behind it, and now I do. So this is from Brian and he says, you know, the New York City area is surrounded by salt marshes and there are tons of or it says, protecting New York City's natural flood and pollution guards as you described them um in the nineties and throughout the eighties and nineties that the Wetlands Preserve. It was an activist nightclub named for the land that Lower Manhattan was built on. The club was on Hudson in Tribeca, very much Downtown Manhattan, which back in the early settlement by the Dutch was in subsequent subsequent takeover by the English was all Salt Marshes. Wetlands Preserve, colloquially referred to as the Wetlands was open from eighty nine to two thousand one. Dual purpose was to create an earth conscious, intimate nightclub that would nurture live music, integrated with a full time environmental and social justice activist center in the club's basement. Wait, what was the years that was open? Eighty nine to two thousand one? There is a hundred percent chance that Jewel played there. He doesn't list to it, but I bet she did. Okay, whoa he lists? He lists a few, but he also links to many more, and she's probably in there. I think I saw wean there if I'm not mistaken. But he said downstairs. Activist planned protests, made pamphlets, wrote letters to politicians and lobbies, generated boycotts and educated club patrons, while upstairs we hosted or they hosted some formative performances for legendary rock brands like Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews, Merein Five, Oasis, Widespread Forget, Jewel Fish, Rise Against Fishbone, Bikini Kill, Blind Melon, and Jewel Yes. The nightclub raised revenue for the Activism Center's effort efforts, and the intern Activism Center staff and volunteers educated nightclub patrons on environmental, social justice, and animal rights issues through posters, educational displays, literature, et cetera, and film screens. The New York based Wetlands Activism Collective continues. The club is shut down, but they continue it's environmental, social and political activism to this day. And that is from Brian Stolary. Nice, Ran, that's pretty great. I never knew that. I think it went to a couple of shows at Wetlands. Oh you did, and I never knew that there was something else going on there, and I kind of had forgotten about it. I wonder if when you showed through, like the Cops Cop Narc that was Brian. You said, Yeah, Brian Stolary, that's pretty cool.
