Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hang, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry over there. Uh, and this is Stuff you Should Know the podcast. How's going It's fine, great. How's it going with you? Good? Jerry's distracting me a little bit because all I see in my peripheral vision is her practicing her new hula fire dance routine. It's pretty dangerous. It's dangerous, but it's um it's interesting to see out of the corner of one's eye. Performance art, performance hula art. Can you hula hoop? I cannot, sir, I'm too self conscious too to even try it. Yeah, it's it's a grown man, forty four year old man hula hooping. Plus when I do it, like as I rotate my hips and make the same ro tap my hips, Yeah, it makes the sound of like almost congealed jello just slopping around in the ball. You know what I mean. I don't want to make that sound. Yeah, but um, I did see at a the East Atlanta Strut Festivals, one of Atlanta's many great neighborhood festivals. I believe the Strut to Me is known for having the better music of most of the festivals. And our buddy Craig Johnson's band played Space Knife, not space Knife O. This one was I can't remember the name of this band, but that band is no longer now he's got a new band. Even that guy is always coming up with new stuff. You could never pay him down too good. You should check out Space Knife though. People on the web you can find it. It's good. It was in our TV show too. Yeah, that's his alter ego. But anyway, Freg's band was playing and this I was pretty hula naive hoop naive at this point. And a few years ago, and um, there was this lady doing uh hula routine to his band playing and I videoed it. It was so awesome. So she was hoop dancing hoop dancing. Yeah, like the neck, the arms, the legs, moving around with it like supremely talented hooper. Yeah. If you go onto the web and and type in hoop dancing, it's gonna bring up some pretty impressive videos. Yeah, and it's quite a workout. I could tell. We'll get to that. But just watching her I got tired, and so I drank another beer and just listen to music. Yeah, and pretended you were hula hooping in your head. Yeah, you're like, I'm so good at this in my head. But I was like, man, that's a thing. Again. I had no idea, but it's a big thing, ya, hula hooping. Yeah, but it's been around for a while, Yes, it has. For example, Chuck, did you know, As Robert points out, Robert Lamb wrote this article from Stuff to Blow your Mind. Yeah, and he says that the hula hoop has been around in some form or fashion since before most of the world's religions. Wow, that's really saying something. That is saying something. So let's get in the way back machine. Oh we're play back time. Yeah, let's go back to one thousand b C. My friend, we're in Egypt and their little children, Egyptian children with dried up grape vines they've made into hoops playing with them, and there's some Egyptian news like get off of my patch of sand kids, Yeah, you know, instead of a lawn. Sure, I get it. That was good. That was all right. Um, so they there, they no doubt used them in similar ways that we did today, But they what one thing they did, which was a big sporting thing to do for a long time, which I don't get personally. The fun value that is is using a stick to push a hula hoop to the road. I think the fun and it is that the hula hoop as it's traveling down the road, which does seem to be the oldest use of the hoop as playtime activity, Right, it wants to fall, it wants to follow over, right, So if you can keep it um going, then there's probably a tremendous amount of personal satisfaction that you can carry all the way to bedtime with and maybe have good dreams because of Yeah, I don't even see if you had a plastic polyethylene hula hoop, a modern hoop, I don't see how a stick like how you would even push it. Uh, you would want a stick with maybe um like a fork, No, probably something like a stick with a big wad of chewed bubble gum on it to like just have some sort of point of contact. Because, as we'll see when we talk about hula hoop physics, friction plays a big part in making hula hoops. Hula hoop, Yes, around the waist that is well in any in this case as well, and the stick makes contact with the hoop, you're using friction to push it along. Good point. So I see your point. Like, if you're going to use a stick on a like a plastic hula, who it's gonna slide off or it's gonna want to Maybe it scares me. That's why I think it's dumb. Maybe I would be made a love by the hoop maybe at first, but chuck, you would have to hang in there and stick with it, and um, pretty soon you'd be rolling hoops like an Egyptian kid. Yeah, like an ancient Egyptian child. Hoop rolling was a big deal throughout ancient Greece as well and Rome. Um, they decorated them with bells and things and toys. Uh, fifth century BC. There's you ever heard of ganny Mede? Ganymede. He was a handsome hero, Oh he was. He supposedly there's an old fifth century BC urn of him, um where he's holding a rooster that was apparently a gift from Zeus and a whop hula whop, clearly hula hoop and apparently this discovery Um, I'm not sure why it's called the Berlin Painter urn, but it is again no idea. But um apparently they said, well, I wonder if hoops played a role in the earliest Olympics. And I guess they've discredited that idea now, but for a while because of this urn, this picture of ganey Mead with a hoop um, they wondered, was it a sport? Yeah, an Olympic sport. But the Greeks supposedly did use hoops for physical fitness as like a physical activity, in very much the same way it's become popular today. I would imagine a hulah an Olympic hula hooper would be sort of like the you know, the what was the sport the curler of today? Are you kind of like an ancient Greece, Like, hey, what do you throw the hammer? What do you do? I'm a hula hooper, although I would guess would probably be more akin to the hula hoopers of today. Yeah, the hooper roller is what the sport would have been. That would be more like curling, right, hula hooping. That's tough, man, it is tough. Uh. What else? The ancient Briton's um they had a game called a battle game called kill the Hoop. Yeah, I like this one when they would roll the hoop and throw try to throw a spear through it. Pretty neat and dangerous. Uh. And apparently they also used it and the hula method and it would people get injured. Yeah, it's there was a fifteen or fifteenth century those are the four hundreds of the fourteenth century century hula hoop craze in Britain in that bizarre that is weird, and yeah, people were getting injured. There was a proclamation by the early physicians. They would pull up there like crows, mask their plague mass just long enough to be like stay away from hula hoops, steer clear of those things. Yeah, the warning was hoops kill was I guess what was posted on the church door. And this is like in addition to being in the way of a spear that was being thrown at a rolling hoop, like this is just from hula hooping. I would stay away from the hoops altogether if I was an ancient Briton. Yeah, because really, if you're like an ancient Briton, you're going from like zero to sixty as far as like physical fitness goes. Once you're hula hooping. Oh yeah, you know, just because you're not just sitting around eating uh like lamb's brains, Yeah, drinking meat? Uh what else? The Native Americans UM have a long culture of using the hoop um in New Mexico, the taos Uh Pueblo people, UM, they used them in ritual dances, private healing ceremonies. And did you look up this chunky thing? No, did you find the chunky reference? I did. The kaho Kean Native Americans. That was an unusual way to pronounced that. How would you say it kaho Kean? I think in Native American would be kaho Kean. That's fine. Uh. Near St. Louis apparently is where they played this game Chunky, which I just had to look it up because a game called Chunky with an E y and um. From what I saw, it was more of a small stone disc than like a hula hoop looking thing, and you would it was like kill the hoop though in Britain, right, Yeah, they would throw a stick apparently it looked like a combination of like um bocci and and kill the hoop. Weird because I think they would try and throw the spear where the disc would eventually land and the closest to the disc one. That's like they're predicting where the where the hoop would fall. I guess this makes sense, although that's not really like Bocci at all. I mean, I get there's a proximity element that's boc s y Um, but I don't know. I don't know. Like once I saw that and saw pictures, I was like, I don't even know if they should be in this article because it's like a small doughnut that's a hoop of sorts. I guess. So it's a stretch if he asked me. But it was a big spectator sport, like fifty acre stadiums of people would watch this would go to the chunky games and so so there was chunky matches in Koho kia Uh, and the pueblo used there. I think, as you said, they used hoops, and they weren't the only ones. UM. There are other tribes from all over North America and meso America. I believe UM that used hoops for dancing. And apparently it was in nine thirty a guy named Tony white Cloud, who was a Yemez pueblo down in New Mexico. UM did like a hoop dance in public and basically brought it back like it had been virtually lost to the ages, at least as far as uh the average American was concerned. Most people didn't know this was the thing. Luckily, Tony white Clouds like check this out did an awesome hoop dance, and then by there were national hoop dancing competitions in New Mexico. Um, and they're a big deal still to this day. Yeah, of course, I think did he kick off the America crazy? No, he didn't. He was strictly native American hoop dancing, not hula hooping. Okay, so let's go to well, let's take a break actually, because this is this is the big revelation here. That's right, all right, Josh, We're at that point where mainstream America goes hoop crazy. But to get to that point, we actually have to go backward again in time for a second, back in the way back machine. So let's go it running. Let's go to I don't know, Feediar, Tahiti, year Poesia. Yeah, and it's the eighteenth century. See all these British sailors drink some rum, oh man, Okay, yeah, in addition to the realm we've already drank today. Uh. So the British sailors that you see here, um, are noticing a hula dance, right, and they're filing it away in their mental catalog. And uh now when they reach Britton again, why have we been saying it like that? I don't know. Uh, they notice that it bears a striking resemblance to what people do with the hula hoop. You gyrate every time you'd say that, by the way, you can't can't not do it. So the term hula became applied to the hoop, especially when you used your hips to gyrate to rotate them. When you rotate your hips with the hoop. Uh, these British sailors ended up applying the word hula to it, and it's stuck. That's where it came from, was Polynesia, even though they was no hoop involved in Polynesia. Correct, Yes, they just kind of ganked that word. You think their own purposes is all over again? That was a big nineties sternm wouldn't it. Let's go watch some X files. Um, what's actually yeah, the movies coming out soon night. Oh yeah, they're doing another one, aren't they that thing will never die. I don't think it should keep doing movies, That's what I say. Um. So we mentioned that the Greeks I believe used it for physical fitness, right. Uh. I don't think we said that. I think I said it, okay, Um the uh, the Swiss actually came to adopt it for the same reasons too in the nineteenth century. In early twentieth century, Yeah, someone named Emil Jacques uh dal Crose and that was great. That's tough. UM had a program called Rhythmics, which, of course I started singing Sweet Dreams this morning because of that, and I've been singing it all day as a result. So that was a special training program. It was apparently a big deal. It was a big deal. So Rhythmics used hoops for UM basically physical fitness, but also interpretive dance, that kind of stuff. It was a combination of It was like dance training is is what I can gather, and it used hoops. The reason that we're mentioning this when we're talking about the American crazes, that it directly led to the American craze potentially because yourhythmics spread from Switzerland to UM. Great Britain and it was brought in as part of like pe class in Australia. And it was in Australia that the founders of Whammo were inspired to create the modern hula hoop that we think of today boom. So it's possible they watched the rhythmics class or heard about the rhythmics class and with Australian kids and then said, well, this is a clearly something of Australian design and let's bring it to the US and started crazy. They said, sweet dreams were made of these. Yeah. Uh. And this was Richard Ner and Arthur spud melon mel malin melon sounds like m l o n like Thornton melon. Uh. Don't tease me with that movie The Great Back to School. I saw a bit of that recently and and the only thought through my head was like, man, why couldn't I have caught this from the beginning? Yeah, because I want to see it all that And man, his son is pasty. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought you were saying that was a line for the movie. It should have been. Yeah, his son Keith Gordon, who became a great movie director. H really Yeah, the guy from Christine and Back to school. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he'd he gave up acting and started directing movies and directed uh a bunch of good movies. One called Waking the Dead. You should see, I thought, Keith Gordon co starred, and they live. I don't know, maybe I'll have to check that. Uh So where were we? Oh? Yes, the two founders um of WAMMO. They said, you know what, let's take these wooden hoops, let's make them out of polyethylene. Let's make them and let's charge a dollar ninety eight for them and make them all kinds of fun colors. Yeah, and boom, the hulahoop craze in night was born. Like it was the definition of a flash in the pancrase, a lot of money in a very short span of time, like a summer. Basically pretty much in Ninemo released it and by the end of nineteen fifty eight these things were rotting in the warehouse. But in the meantime they sold globally, globally from the summer to the end of ninety eight a hundred million. Who who Yeah, more than that, I think, dam my brain, Yeah, you forgot what we were talking about. I almost said, Frisbee, did we do one on the frisbee. No, I thought we had, but we haven't have we No, we did one on the boomerang, right, just like a frisbee, but it's like a dangerous frisbee. Uh. So they sell all these hula hoops. They make a ton of money, um, like, you know, over fifty million dollars in a short span of time, which I'm sure they weren't happy with that that it didn't last, but they were also probably like an injection of cash like that is great for any business. Yeah, and then they moved on to the frisbee and made even more money. Yeah. And they did not secure a patent for it. I guess it didn't matter in the long run. Well, they couldn't because it was so yeah, demonstrably an ancient invention that nobody could patent it. Nope, but they trademarked it. They did. They trade marked the name hula hoop in the United States, which is why, uh we still call it hula hoop today. I guess it just became we should probably put the title with a are in a certain goal for this. Oh, yeah, we should do that, like Barbie. Uh. It was named the number thirty five toy of all time UM by Time magazine and they know toys toys, And then from nineteen sixty eight to nineteen eighty one there were national hula hoop contests held and the guess in the early eighties people were finished with it. There were also like a tremendous amount of um music, like musical singles released called the hula hoop song. Different people recorded different songs about hula hooping. Doesn't surprise me. Yeah, it was a crazy big time And you say that they were done with it by the eighties, not true. The national competitions there was so if you look at hula hooping records, the most recent hula hoop records from two thousand nine, Well, but was that part of a national competition probably, or just a guy named Aaron Hibbs he hula hooped, just hula hooped for seventy four hours and fifty four minutes. Wow. He broke the record of I didn't even stand up for that long. He broke the record of a girl named Kim kob rely um. She held the record twice, in nineteen with fifty four hours and in nineteen eighty four for seventy two hours, which is pretty impressive. People do like hundreds of them at once. Yeah, there's a guy named Paul Dizzy Hips Blair who set the record in two thousand nine with a hundred and thirty two hoops at the same time. That's impressive. He's basically probably just like like the Michelin man made of hula hoops. Ever tell you about the Surface Area Man constant him in Athens that was out on Halloween, um in Athens in college and those the dude I know. The guy's name is Blake. He has You may have seen him. He had big red dreadlocks, kind of a short guy, just a ubiquitous Athens dude. He lives kind of in my neighborhood now. I still see him every once a while. We called him Sideshow Blake because of Sideshow Bob. And he came in bar and the Georgia Bar, and he had these foam disks around his arms, around his legs, around his waist and neck that were huge, like probably four ft across, and he was Surface Area Man and that was just his costume because when he moved around, he took up like, you know, probably seventy five square feet in space and he would just move through the bar and say, I'm surface area man, and I'll always remember every time I see Blake. I saw him at the grocery store the other day. Was he dressed like that? No, but that was like surface He wouldn't fit down the grocery aisle. Does he have dread still? Yeah? Does he really still rocking the red dreads? He's dedicating? He looks exactly the same. Actually, but we weren't friends. I could actually like him. Actually, I'm gonna just walk by him and go surface area man. I'm gonna do it. All right, Let's talk about the Hudsucker Proxy for a quick moment, and then we'll take another break. Did you ever see that one? I don't think I made it through that one. The Coen Brothers, Yeah, uh not. All of their movies are great. I disagree. I love the Cohen Brothers, but some of their movies stink. Oh boy that they're part of my pcent club where every movie they've made it has been great. That is wrong? Which other ones? Don't you like? The Man who Wasn't There? Love it? Uh? Bob Robertson, They didn't. That wasn't there? Well it was terrible? Okay? Uh? Well, the Hudsucker Proxy too. I liked it. I would put it at lesser Cohen's for sure, you would have to, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Lee and Paul Newman u in a fictitious tale of the invention of the hula hoop. Um. It is not the true biopic of the invention of the hula hoop, but they co opted it for one of their movies and it was nothing pretty great. But that's just me, okay, all right, go ahead, Well no, that was it that I just want to shout it out. Fine, Uh well, then let's take a break because are about to get into physics in hoop games. Yep. After this, no Country for Old Man terrible. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I love that's maybe the best. Raising Arizon is probably the best that It'd be tough for me to pick on any given day, but far Ago is the one I can watch over and over. Yeah, I would say this three year time for first. Did we just come back from the break? Just sick? Going right back into the car? I don't know. All right, let's do it. We'll see how Jerry edits this. Um, so let's it wouldn't be a Stuff You Should Know podcast if we didn't talk about the science behind something seemingly unscientific. Well, hula hoops are super complex as far as physics goes, you know, super complex, super complex. There's just a few things. We are not in agreement on stuff today, are we? I don't know what's going on. So let's say you have a hula hoop, right, and it's around your waist, and you take it and you wrote you have it up against maybe one hips making contact with your body. That you're starting in the traditional way, then sure, and you whip it around to one side, and as you do you start rotating your hips. Right, I'm rotating my hips chests. Uh. And as you do that, when you rotate your hips, what you're doing is, first of all, you're conserving the angular momentum you gave the hula hoop when you pushed it in a certain direction, twisted it around yourself. Right, that's right. You are the axis you, Yes, you are the excess to and when you move your hips around you, when you when you rotate your hips, you're applying what's called torque. Yeah, because all this hoop wants to do is fall down around on the ground and you look foolish. It wants to stop. Well, no, it doesn't want to stop because of inertia. It wants to keep going, but it can't because of friction. But it wants to fall down to the ground like you said, and make you look foolish. But ironically, that same friction is keeping it from doing that. Who was the fool? Now? Whoop the hula hoop? Fool? All right? Did you talk about the torque? I did talk about torque, and torque is a twisting force where you're twisting your hips. You're thrusting the hula hoop around in the circle, and what you're doing there is contributing to the centripetal force and its centrifical no send trip at all, two different things. Move is a force that moves at a right angle to the motion of your body, so it keeps that thing whatever it is, say, hula hoop or tractor tire, which, by the way, someone said a record hula hooping with a tractor tire. Yeah, for like seventy seconds of fifty four pound tire. How big was a person? I'm sure he's ginorm all right, Um, I think he's from like bailor roost or something, you know. Yeah, they do that on a daily basis. So, uh, with the centripetal forces is going at a right angle to the direction that you're thrusting your hips, it's constantly going to move around the circle on the axis. That is centripetal force, boom, tripetal motion. I should say yes. And when this hoop wants to fall, of course, we're talking about gravity. Gravity wants to win that fight. But um, if you keep that pulsing gyration going, then you're gonna keep that hoop just a little ahead of the curve. Yeah, that's apparently the key, and Robert puts this in here is a kind of like a throwaway thing that I think that's the key of hula hooping is you want your hip to move just before that that I guess wave that comes in contact with your body again, comes in contact like comes catch and release in a way. Okay, you can catching it on your up and then slinging it back around. I'm gyrating. There's a lot of gyrating going on in this room right now. It's crazy. Um, So there's a few different parts of the body at work. Um. I don't know why in two thousand four they needed a fifteen page study in the Journal of Biological Cybernetics to figure this out, because if you just look at somebody, you can tell that the hips, knees and ankles are really what's at play keeping that thing going. And that's if you're just doing the the hip hula hoop, notack and legs and all that. Of course, it's just the standard hooping, right. Yeah. And so another study I think four years later, in the Journal of Human Movements. I don't know why they needed that. They built upon this two thousand four study and said, okay, you use your hips, knees and ankles. Everybody uses it, but depending on the individual, there'll be different contributions from the hips, knees or ankle depends on the motion of your ocean exactly. So it's like the individual. Everybody uses the same the same parts, but they use them in different percentages to come up with the hula hooping motion. Yeah. I've got certain body types are better at this than others too. Yeah. Slim, yeah, yeah, probably so that the one in front of A Craig's band, she was pretty slam. I guess she's working that thing. Man. It was like, it was pretty amazing hula hoop. So that's hoop dancing. When we'll finish up here with some other games. Well, we didn't talk about hoop dancing. We were just talking about hula hooping. No, we talked about hoop dancing at the beginning with that lady. Oh yeah, okay, so that's hoop dancing. Okay, that's when you know it's around the neck and then you work it down around your hips and then up one arm and then up the other arm. It's pretty impressive. Um, your standard hula hooping, of course, which we've covered. Uh, speed and endurance depends on what you're after, sure, like I want to do this for twenty minutes, or I want to do it really fast for five minutes. Okay, hooper, that's one of my favorite trendling Like you're a little ancient Egyptian kid. I'd like to see you do that hoop rolling. Let's do it. Let's do a video for that. Okay, we could do a periscope of it. Oh yeah, let's do that. We're gonna start doing that. We could do at least one of me hoop rolling. I think people, Well, we're gonna get emails, they'll turn out and droves to see that. Hundreds of people show up for that. There's one not on this list that I want to give a shout out to. All Right, what it was invented? Apparently in Belgium they call it Belgium skipping. It's called ankle skipping. It's where you put the hula hoop on one foot around one ankle and you use it to hula hoop. You make the hula hoop motion with that one and if it comes around, you jump through the hoop with the other one. Yeah, I can't believe it wasn't on this list. Yeah, that's a solid hooped endeavor. But apparently it's a pretty recent invention from like the sixties. All Right, that makes sense. Um, that's sort of like hoop jumping, but not quite know hoop jumping is more like jump roping with a hula hoop. Yeah, but that kind of reminds me of that too. Okay. Hoop jumping is when you hold the hula hoop the top of it and then you swing it around your body and jump up and down. Um, like you have nothing better to do in life, right, Like you can't find a jump rope you haven't heard of those before. Return the hoop. This is the only one I was ever good at. That's when you you hold it vertically and you fling it out as hard as you can backwards, and it sort of spins in place and comes back to you, and if you're not expecting it, you're gonna turn and run because it's startling. He talked about kill the hoop. We don't recommend you use spears to do that, or just make sure nobody's in the vicinity of where the hoop is. Yeah, you don't want to combine hoop chundling and kill the hoop because you'll kill the hoop chund to lure. And I'm not even to cover this last one. I dare YouTube though. I like this one. Whop your environment, Yeah, go ahead. So it's like can put hula hoops around and you jump from them like their their islands and there's a lot of in between. Okay, what's wrong with that? I don't know, too childish, No, I'm very childish, but I don't know. I just didn't there's a dear childlike not childish. Big difference. Man. Uh, Well, we talked about exercise. It is um legitimate exercise are hula hoop classes now. Um, apparently Marissa Tomay, the actor, um, took hoop fitness classes to lose weight for or to get in shape for her movie The Wrestler in two thousand eight. Uh. First Lady in Michelle Obama is very famously hoop worked out. Yeah, whop hooped the lawn of the White House to say, hey, kids, get active and at the US Open, yeah, you can still have fun by doing this. Um. And they even did another study to see what kind of calories you could burn. Lots of hoop studies, um, too many. Um. They took women between sixteen at the nine and said go crazy and hoop and they yeah. And they were weighted hoops too, by the way, Um, which is not to say they were super heavy. They're generally still pretty light weight. Yeah. But strangely a weighted hoop is easier to keep going, yes, which makes sense, I think. Uh. And they average a hundred fifty one beats per minute. Yeah heart beats oh their heart Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Tripical Quest would be proud. Uh. And that is burning seven calories a minute or two ten calories during a half hour of hooping. So that's good. Exercise people. That's like, um, weightlifting type calorie burn yeah plus also um, like if you just break it down to calorie first of all, chalk. I want to do an episode and I'm not quite sure how to frame it yet. It doesn't have a thesis. But there are so many like medical myths out there that are just taken as fact, even by the medical establishment, even though like if you asked a doctor like is this fact, they would be like, no, no, actually it's not like drinking eight glasses of water a day totally made up and that Like, I think we should do one on medical myths sometime. What do you think we should have? We not No, Like part of me wants to say we have, but I think things to have just come up like here there over over the years. Anyway. Um, if even if you take the calories out of the equation, just hula hooping, the standard hip gyration hula hoop will really really work out your core. Yeah, like hoop. No, you can just sit in your chair and do what I'm doing now, Like I'm getting I'm sweating. Yeah right now, my lip, my upper lip is broken out in perspiration. Uh. Modern hooping Um burlesque uses hoops. If you go to any music uti, well, these days you're gonna see the ladies like I was talking about, or they might have them decked out with L E D s or even fire. Well what's neat is um L E D hula hoops in particular are really displaying like the physics of hula hoops pretty net through Like, Um, what's that type of photography LSD? No? No, uh, what's the what's that photography where you like you just keep the shutter open, so like high exposure, long exposure. Yeah, you just said it, keeping that shutter open. It's like when you see the pictures of the cars on the freeway right and it's just like a long trail of headlights. Yeah, but there are photos out there of L E ed um hula hoops there.
