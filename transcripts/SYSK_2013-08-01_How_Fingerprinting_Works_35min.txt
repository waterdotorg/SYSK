Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and there's Stuffy Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry and there's some papers in front of me, and then I key a lamp and a big old microphone and it's all pressing in on me really hard. That means this is stuff you should know. That means Josh has gone on vacations. When the microphone is the size of a watermelon, it's just hitting you in the face. Yeah, I'm like, it doesn't normally a braid my chin is today. So yeah, Chuck, Josh, how are you doing. I'm great. You get some fingerprints there? Let me see you. Um, I have four on my fingers and one each on each thumb. Yeah, are you're one of those guys on um Oh, let me tell you a little story about where your little fingerprints came from, back when Chuck, little Chuck was just a ten week old fetus. Okay, so nineteen seventy it's a certain point in nineteen seventy. Well, if I was born in March seventy one, and that would go back, just go back nine months from there. Okay, whatever that is, uh nine seventy. So your your little basil cell layer of your skin. You got three. You got the epidermis, the outer layer, the basil layer, which is in between that's like that where all the new skin cells are produced. Then there's a dermist below that. Those are your three layers. About that time, your little basil layer started going haywire, producing skin cells at a much faster rate than your epidermis and your dermist, which meant that your basil layer was growing up against your epidermis and your dermists squishing together. Yeah. And so when this would happen, when it would grow up against say you're your epidermis, it would create a point of contact, and that point of content act would create enough pressure so that your basil layer would buckle a little bit. And what's weird about that was that your little basil layer buckled in what appeared to be little patterns, little worlds, little swoops, little circles. But what's neat, chuck is at this point, within the next six weeks after it started, you had fingerprints that are going to stay the same for the rest of your life, just beneath your epidermis. Yeah, the tiny little chuck fingers are now sort of tiny little man fingers, but they are the same fingerprints throughout my entire line. That's right, And you can it's true damage your fingerprints. Some people have purposely, which we'll talk about, but for the most part, since it's your basil layer, that's where the actual fingerprint is. Even if you cut your epidermis, which happens, your skin will grow back in your basil layer will remain the same. Your fingerprints will remain the same. That's a great way to end this good night. Uh that was a great little story. And I would grow up to be a sociopath podcaster with those very same fingerprints. I don't think you're sociopathic. I'm just kidding. Um, So we're talking fingerprints, and you mentioned the little ridges, little worlds, and we're not making these words up. W H O R L S is actually what it's called worlds. Valleys and uh loops loops, arches, arches. Those are three. I don't know where you got valleys. Um, well, it's a in the pattern. But that's not a part of the official fingerprints fingerprint classic cases. No, no no, no, no, that's not a part of the classic Um, but each are unique. And we all know this because you know that's why they use fingerprinting as one of the biometric UH sciences to classify people and identify people. Um, there's a one in sixty four billion chance that your finger fingerprint will match exactly with someone. So get this. Sir Francis Galton was the one who said that, and he was saying that through his classification system legally speaking, as far as what would be admissible in court, probably there would be a one and sixty four chance of matching people's fingerprints up. He also he also thought that if you went down on more of a a more granular level and looked at people's fingerprints, there were probably a better chance that people would have fingerprints who matched. And if you take Galton's kind of liberal view of matching fingerprints, and you have a one and sixty four billion chance of having matching fingerprints with somebody just looking like that's somebody just looking at the patterns. Um. Since about a hundred billion people have lived in the history of humanity, that means that there's at least one pair of people who have ever lived who had the same fingerprints. And that's if you subscribe to his numbers. Yeah from eighteen whatever, which may be overestimating it are we are fingerprints may be slightly more similar than you think. Interesting. Yeah, well they are more unique than DNA, because we all know if you listen to the Twins podcast that twins can share a lot of DNA, but they can't share fingerprints. No, it's different, it's very different. Um, all right, so let's get into this. Fingerprints, um are actually made of ridges called friction ridges, and they have little pores underneath them, and it's the pores where you leak like sweat and oils, and that's actually what the mark you are leaving as a fingerprint is coming up through those pores at those friction ridges. You're not leaving skin behind, No, you're just leaving a little bit of steam, that's right. And they're really popular way of uh, probably the most popular biometric right now because everyone's leaving fingerprints. Everyone's got fingers, well not everyone. They're easy to classify, they're easy to sort. Um. They do mention this article that like you could probably do the same thing with like toe prints, but um, no one wants to ask all these criminals to take off their shoes and socks and like toe prints, especially not if they just defecated in the back seat of the police cruiser. Plus, you're more likely and they even mentioned this in the article, you're more likely to leave a fingerprint than a toe print. They don't even put that in here. A lot of people that was the most obvious. Uh yeah, you know, you're not gonna commit a crime barefoot, and some people do. But it's necessary. But nowadays it's virtually too late because we've amassed such a database of fingerprints that, like a bare footprint would be almost useless unless you had the person in the suspect. It was about one and every six people have their fingerprints on record. Yeah, and that doesn't mean that one and every six people have been charged with the crime. But there's a lot of ways that fingerprints make it into the fingerprint database. Aphis uh yeah, what people use them as a signature verifications these days, as um to identify victims, um job applications. Sometimes the first time mine made it in because my dad took me to the public library to have me fingerprinted as a child. Really yeah, it's just so now that like we have your kid on file in case he ever goes missing. Yep. After that whole Adam Walsh thing. That was it, like anything anybody said like this could help if your kid is kidnapped or whatever. Parents just did it in the early eighties. My parents did. No. No, I don't think I'm on file anywhere. Really with my fingerprints? That's good, is it? I guess so? Sure? Man, your fingerprints are your own? Yeah? Maybe so. Um, and that is one in six people. And apparently the iPhone five s the rumor is is it is going to have fingerprint authentification instead of your pass code. Wow, it's pretty neat. We'll see. That's the rumor. We used to have laptops here that had that. Well, yeah you did. I'd never use mine. Yeah I did. I thought it was pretty cool. Yeah. Thumb print right, Uh, whatever you wanted. I think it was really either your thumb, your fore finger, or your middle finger. I would have done my bigtoe right. It would have been like, isn't it obvious? Um, there's I guess cars. Some cars now have birometric Um. I guess ignitions. Yeah, and we might as well talk about why that stinks. Yeah, because in Malaysia. Yeah, in Malaysia, they cut off a guy's finger to get into his Mercedes. And that is a worry for police as fingerprinting becomes more and more used as authentification, uh that people are gonna start cutting fingers off to do so did you say authentification, authentification, authentication, authentication? What do you add in another syllable? Oh? Boy? So, hey, don't get on me about words. Yeah I can't. Okay, Um, there's one that won't bring up what the deletrius deleterious. I just say it in my own way. No, deletrious this is not a word. It is. You're deleting it. It deletes things. It's negative, all right. So, um, and if you off this case. Uh so the biometric companies who said, well, we can't have our customers fingers being cut off, said well, now we'll just add a little something that the texts blood flow. So now our customers are just kidnapped rather than have their fingers cut off or the the kidnapper doesn't know this. And you you still have your car, but you're out of finger right. You should probably put like that kind of thing on ads on busses, yeah, or put it on your car like, oh yeah, car will not start. A finger is detached. Yeah, because think about that could be even worse if their finger. If the finger doesn't work, they're like, oh, maybe it's his other finger. Just keep cutting fingers off and you're like, no, it needs a pulse. Alright. So we talked about the friction ridges. Yeah, they're called f Just remember because they buck up buckle under the pressure. The friction up against the dermis that can take the pressure. Buckles. Um. But the forms a specific pattern and this is what you know. The arrangement shape and size and number of lines is what they're looking for when they're identifying and comparing these things. And there's three different patterns there can be. Uh, there's loops begins on one side, curves up and around and exits the other. Yeah, look at your fingers while we describe. There are radio loops and owner loops, um radial slope toward the thumb, owner towards the little finger, and intuitive to tell which way that the slope is going. Oh yeah, just yeah, because technically you could be like, well no, I think it's so much way to turn your head. The aforementioned whirls are circular or spiral in nature, and arches slope up and then down like, and they're described here as narrow mountains. Yeah, it just goes. I think that summed it up. So those are the identifying marks on your fingers, um that you can see the naked eye. And then if you're in law enforcement, they're gonna be also analyzing something called minutia, which you can't see with the naked eye. No. And these are basically like further characteristics of the loops and worlds and arches. So you might you might have a spur, which is another um like world that comes off of a larger whirl um. Or there's an abrupt end to a ridge, or there's bifurcation or islands. It's like a world within a world. Um. There's deltas, which are like ridges that form like y patterns, just a little stuff like that, and they all form this classification system that the cops rely on when they fingerprint you. And the the science, the forensic science of fingerprinting is called deactyloscopy. That's right, like pterodactyl um. And I guess there are probably some places still that do it the old fashioned way UM and don't have digital scanning finger methods. Montana hello, Montana, Um. They would do it like you've seen it on countless TV shows and movies. They would clean your hand off, dry it off with alcohol. Yeah, they want to get all the sea bulm off, get all the sum off, roll the fingertip um, and then I usually say left or right, but I imagine you could do either way to get the ink on the finger. Make sure it's fully covered. Then you roll onto the card from fingernail to fingernail, from one side to the other. That is called a rolled fingerprint. Yeah. You do this with all eight fingers and two thumbs and uh, then you've got your set of rolled prints. Then they take your hands and cover all your fingers with the ink and then just have you press it down flat at the bottom of this fingerprint card. And uh, those are that's a set of flat prints which are used apparently to um verify the uh um yeah, exactly to say they have two sets basically, yeah. Um. If you live in the modern world and you live in a large city, you're probably gonna have digital scanners doing the same thing. Um. It's an optical scanner that basically put your fingers on there and it through magic converts that into digital data patterns and then they have programs that map those points and basically it's sort of like you see in the movies. Yeah, and what's neat about the optical scanners. The picture that it makes is the inverse. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense, So you're uh to negative image, right. The the the the worlds and everything had more light bounce off of them, so they tend to be lighter. Um, whereas like the valleys and everything in between, the friction ridges are darker. And I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's more accurate than rolled prints. I might be wrong, You're probably right from what I've read. Sure, Yeah, because you know when someone's like you ever seen First Blood? No? Yeah, you have stallone the Vampire Show? No, No, that's true Blood, first Blood. The Rambo first printure. Remember when he was being difficult when they were booking him and he wasn't doing the fingerprinting right right, They couldn't get good prints because Rambo wouldn't stand for it. No, he doesn't take any crap, all right. There's two types of prints visible prints that we talked of. Um, actually we didn't talk about him there there if you actually leave an intention in something, a visible print like dirt or clay or something blood or something like that. Blood would be a good example. It's visible. You can look and say there's a fingerprint exactly. There's also latent prints, which we leave everywhere all the time. Um. And those are the ones that are just made with the sea bum coming out of our fingers, the pores on our friction ridges, and those are typically not necessarily naked to the the human eye. Like if you look at like, yes, stainless steel, you'll probably see some pressure clear class maybe right, But those are technically latent prints. Um. They also can be um invisible to the naked eye, and so they have to be um dusted. Yeah, and they actually do dust with a little brush. UM. I looked up the dusting powder fingerprinting powder, and apparently most of it these days is proprietary, so like you don't know exactly what's in it, really, I just guess like carbon, who knows. Maybe I know you should formulate your own Josh's fingerprinting caller, you know, market it to some local harmfulks enforcement agencies. Yeah, I'll sell it like snake oil or something like Uncle Peppi's patented a one blue ribbon fingerprinting. Uh so they lift the prints, um, these latent prints, and those are the obviously the prints too that you see criminals and TV shows and movies always trying to wipe off with a hanky, right, very wisely, Yeah, I wonder if what the if that really works? You want to get into that, do you know? Yes, it should Okay, it should work from what I understand. I read this one paper that was basically like, we should not be using fingerprints in court any longer. That first of all, we have DNA now, and DNA is objective. It's like this protein sequence is the same as this protein sequence. Right with fingerprinting is subjective, even though there's an extensive classification system, it's I think that this print matches up to this print. There's not. It's not quantitative, or if it is, it's not enough quantitative enough. Also, there's so much faith placed by the public in fingerprint analysis that fingerprinting people who do this work frequently are matching stuff like they're they're taking a great role print and comparing it to like just the worst smudge print on the planet, where you know, you can be like, I don't get that because I'm not a dactyloscopist. But I'm sure that somebody who who is that could could figure this out. And supposedly that's a lot of faith that we're placing into people, and that now that DNA evidence is becoming more and more UM available and prevalent and widespread, it's starting to show like um fingerprinting is actually probably put a lot of innocent people behind bars, and we really shouldn't rely on it anymore because even even if you have a great print that you took a latent print, right yeah, and there are plenty like they're not shysters or frauds or crooks because even within their profession, a lot of them are like there's a lot of recklessness going on here. Um that you're never going to have a really great latent print. It's never gonna be good, and so you're working from a deficit every time, and you're also comparing it to a role print, and a roll print is also not the same as another rolled print made right after. Like you can take somebody's finger and roll it from fingernails, fingernail, pick it up, put it on the next little box, roll the same finger from fingernail, the fingernail and you're going to have basically two different prints. So that's in the olden days before they had the digital scanning though, right, But those are still a lot of the ones on file imagine. Yes, And I feel like we're probably still dealing with the same deficits. The paper I read was from like two thousand five or seven, so it's not like it was old and they're they're saying like this is still going on with the advent of digital scanning. Plus, I think you know as well as I do, when you're a court and the attorney yells at the top of his lungs his fingerprints were found all over the murder scene, your your toast, well, yeah, and I think that a lot of perpetrators to think that, like if they have your prints but you're dead, that's it, and like they have you dead to rights, so you might as well confess. And I'm sure it's a great tool for confessing. Yeah. I wonder if d n A thwarts I wonder if anything like that actually thwarts people from committing crimes. You know, I wonder if anyone ever stops and goes, boy, now a d n A. I would think you can just wipe down a crime scene, Like if I drop a hair on the carpet, then I could be, you know, nabbed. Sure I would think that's a pretty good deterrent. Yeah, I just don't know in the criminal mind how how that operates. I'm sure it makes them operate a lot less sloppy than I used to. You know, that's a good point. All right, Let's talk a little bit about the history, because it's pretty interesting. I think, um that in ancient Babylon they actually uh press fingertips and clay to for some business transactions. Pretty advanced. I mean, thousands of years ago people already understood like if fingertips are unique, and of course the Chinese we're always ahead of the game on everything. It seemed like they actually used ink on paper for business transactions and help identify their kids, like my dad. Yeah, I thought it was kind of weird, though, can you un identify your child? Oh well, if they grow up, if they're kidnapped and take into another village, I guess, so they grow up in return to claim of birthright. Yeah, that's a good point. Sure. Um, it wasn't until they didn't use them for identifying criminals until the nineteenth century and there's a series of events that's sort of just not necessarily connected, happened one after the other to sort of advance it at the same time. The first eight was a guy named Sir William Herschel, and Englishman who was chief magistrate of the Hoogli District in India, and he started recording fingerprints when signing documents. So that's kind of the first thing, right. Then you mentioned Henry Faulds. He came around next, Scottish doctor. Yeah, he was, Um, I guess he got into Japanese pottery and noticed like the fingerprints left behind by the artists, and um, he started getting into fingerprinting. So he wanted to create a classification system and said, I'm not gonna do it myself. I'm cousins to Charles Darwin all this asked him to do it. He's pretty good at that, and Darwin said, I'm kind of busy, but I have another cousin. His name is Sir Francis Galton, and he's going to be into this. Galton here's a eugenicist. I wonder if Darwin was like, oh god, it's you know, another classification Henry again, I almos pass him off. The cousin, cousin Frank, Yeah, be cousin Frank. So, like you said, he was augenicist, um and he got I feel like we talked about him before he pops up here there, just pretty big in um in this era. Yeah, he was the first dude to really start kind of collecting biometric information on people, um, not just fingerprints, all kinds of stuff. And being a eugenicist, he decided that there was a perfect human and we should selectively breed ourselves. That's right. Yeah, we're not promoting his work by the way. Um, although in two he wrote a book called Fingerprints and he outlined his systems, first time it had ever been done, and it was based on the system we know today archist loops and roles. Uh. And then in France, the guy named Alfonse Bertillon. Now he's made maybe four appearances in our podcast before I knew I knew that name. Um, he was at the same time using his own system called bert Bertiel nage and uh, anthropometry is basically what he was doing. Yeah, because remember he was like working in the Paris police department and like he saw the same criminals come and go, but they use aliases. So he devised the system of like measuring their face and head in their tears and all that. Definitely sketches. He was definitely that one. Yeah, definitely UM. And he one of them also was fingerprinting too, but his his system was extremely exhaustive, even though it was adopted by the London police. I believe it was just all it was really time consuming, sure, but he was advancing the art, like eight of them at once. Uh. And then about the same time in Argentina, UM, a police officer named Juan Uh. You wanna try that a it sounds good, doesn't sound Argentinian, but Umo, he actually used fingerprinting. This is a two in a case to convict a mother who had killed her two kids, when in fact she was saying it was her her boyfriend. He actually matched fingerprints and she confessed and like he had her first case right, there were actually being used in uh to convict a criminal. Yeah, that was the first time it ever happened. Two and Buenos Aires, UM, I think what The following year eree a guy named Sir Edward Henry. He was the commissioner of the police department. He became interested in using fingerprinting to fight crimes. UM. And he came up with a classification system that further extended Galton's UM. So he came up with, I believe the minutia and UM, I guess the kind of the comparable points that we rely on still today. It's called the henrylassification system. And when you see on tv UM, you know, a fingerprint fed into a computer and like it flashes through for some reason all of the fingerprints that it's matching them against that is using the Henry classification system that this guy created in that's pretty awesome. Uh. In nineteen o one, Scotland Yard established the Fingerprint Bureau, it's first one, and then they used them as evidence the following year for the first time, and then the year after that in New York they started using it in state prisons. And then the FBI said it's not a bad idea, let's get on board exactly, So everybody's getting on board. The Henry system like really allowed a system of classification that could be used anywhere UM to be devised, and it was adopted. The problem was it was extremely time consuming too. Yeah, you're matching paper to paper basically, and you're doing it with a magnifying glass. Yeah, that the computer systems that we see today on TV, those are going through you know, millions, say, um, possible matches. Even if you had like a thousand, how many detectives would it take to just look through a set of prints, your control prints and then you know, another print to find a killer or something like that from a latent print. Yeah, they call it minutia for a reason. Exactly. Imagine those guys went kind of nuts, um, And that's if they even had a fingerprint on file, like they were counting on someone having because at the time, you know, it was only criminals had figger prints. Well, they probably were like, this looks like a man's thumb print. Let's go through all the thumb prints of the men we have on file and see if we can catch somebody. Thummy, it was much better if like you could catch a suspect, print them and then compare it. But that's you know, not necessarily what they were doing. Luckily, we created computers to be our mindless slaves at this kind of stuff, and starting around the seventies, Yeah, and Japan was their national police agency, was the first one to use this kind of automation. In the nineteen eighties and they created the Automated Fingerprint Identification systems APISTS. Its slogan was warm, fuzzy happiness. That's what it says in quotes in their name, the Automated Fingerprinting Concern. Uh so they used it in the US UM to too great effect. Although the problem was it wasn't integrated, Like you know, they didn't share information between agencies or between districts of of law enforcement. So you're kind of just stuck with whoever you had on file, right like, even though it was computerized. A yeah, yeah, a particular police department, maybe even a statewide police department if you're luck, could buy APHIST an apist system. Yeah, but like that was your APHIST system. Fortunately, the FBI said, hey, there's this awesome thing called the Internet. Yeah I should I say, fortunately if you're a criminal, not necessarily fortunately, or you're in the privacy and all that. Um. But they, the FBI and I think UM created the Integrated APHIS UM, which basically plugged all of these databases together and created one huge database that the FBI maintains screwed up. Their acronym though, i aphis Yeah it's terrible. UM. So yeah, now there's one in six Americans who has their fingerprints on file and i aphis yea, and I think they say it takes a about thirty minutes as little as thirty minutes to scan against everyone in the entire country at this point, including mud shots, criminal histories, seven million people on record. That's not bad, including you, my friend. Yeah, you better keep that hanky on you at all times. Wiped down my print, your prints. I could also just stay on the straight and narrow. Oh yeah, that's true. I'll like you wipe my prints down? Is to be sure. Should we talk a little bit about other biometrics, even though we've covered some of the stuff. If you want I scans, they're really expensive there. Um, the retinas and the iris are also unique, but um, they're just super expensive. So the only place you're going to see those are like high security, like expensive facilities. Well, it depends. The retina scan is extremely detailed and tough. The iris scan supposedly is much quicker, and you're more likely to find those. Um it's cheaper to yeah, a little more prevalently, but still you're not gonna find that at your average parties. Um, what about Carl Jr? Though? Okay, ear scans. Apparently ears are unique in size and shape instructor as well. I think they used this too for scanning crowds as well. Like part official recognition is scan ears? Interesting? Yeah, slapdash scary boys. Fingerprints. Um, there's an audio lab the FBI operates in Quantico, Virginia. UM, and when there are messages from supposed known terrorists, they run it through their program and it does pretty good job. It's not like a fingerprint, but they can do a pretty good job with vocal analysis. At this point, you could also use this if you're, like say, um, contacting your bank in Geneva by phone. Your bank may use some sort of voice print analysis to say, okay, you're you single favorite song. I wonder if they do what they do, have you say yeah or do? I'm sure it's just your name, but it'd be funny if like they had you sing you give love a bad name all right by chuck? Uh? And then d N A of course. Um. There was just a ruling last week in the Supreme Court. They ruled five to four that DNA swabs can now be taken at the time of arrest for serious crimes. Um. Is that right? Yeah? So for serious crimes. I thought the whole the whole row over the this was that it was like like it can just take him from anybody. Well, it's like it's just for serious crimes. The whole row is the fact that it's a police officer doing it and not a like you're not at the police station with a trained you know, d n A analysis analyst man and Allen nice what is wrong with me today? Yea. In the ruling they said that they've essentially found that it's the same thing as fingerprinting, So now cops are gonna have a little swab mouth swab kits in their cars. And uh, it was applied before ruling. It was close. And it's some people you know are up in arms about it, saying it's civil rights, uh infringement, and yeah, the end of privacy is what we're witnessing. Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. It's sad to see nobody, nobody's doing anything about it that that n s a whistleblower gave up his life basically, and everybody it's like, wow, I guess I always suspect that was going on anyway, right, you know, so anyway, um fingerprints, yes, you got anything else? I got nothing else. All right, Well, if you want to learn more about fingerprints, you can type that word into the search part how stuffworks dot com. And since I said search part, that means it's time for message break. Yeah, I know it's time for listening mail Josh, I'm gonna call this. UH. Let's let's help this uh young lady raise some money for cancer. We don't do this lot. We get a lot of requests and we can't do them all. We wish we could. But Whitney spoke to me. She's been listening for years. She's a big fan. She has started as an undergrad and now she is wrapping up her second year in law school at the Ohio State University. Couple of guys, Yeah, um, I know you like to hear about awesome charities. I wanted to share this unique one here in Columbus, Ohio. UH pellots Onya is a bike ride that raises money for life saving cancer research. Goes raised by writers goes to cancer research at the James Cancer Center at Ohio State. UM. It especial to me because my grandmother got cancer treatment at the James when she did not have health insurance, and she was proud that they could use her rare case to potentially help find a cure for others. Um Nancy passed away in two thousand eleven. She was fighting her cancer. In the course of a single day though the age of sixty five, she began having severe dementia like symptoms. We are not sure why. Symptoms left her unable to mentally compete with the cancer and without her willpower and understanding um that she had an extremely rare terminal cancel cancer to battle, her health went downhill quickly. Still, her inter dignity shine through, even with a drastic drop in body weight and repeated trips to the e R. So in memory of her grandmother, she is writing for charity. So she's raised two d and fifteen dollars right now. I think we should pump that up a little bit in our listeners. So I created a little tiny rol of her page um H T T P colon slash slash tiny rol dot com slash m r m k X six V. So that's m r m k x six v after tiny orl dot com and that is Whitney Bramlin's bike ride page. It goes down August tent, I believe, and that'd be cool if we did race all extra dough for her. Yeah, everybody gets to there. That's pretty good. So and you know, it's one of those things where you can get like five dollars if you want to, dude to skip that latte today, I say, and donate to Whitney's calls. Yeah, way to go Chuck.
