Josh: Hey, March is tripod month, my friend, and you know what that means. Yes, that means it's time to let people know about your favorite podcasts, just to share the sheer joy of podcast listening. That's right, it's t r y pod still in nascent industry. A lot of people don't know what podcasts are and helps everybody out if you would go out and just say, hey, family member, who I see it? Thanksgiving once a year? Right, you should try out this thing called a podcast. Here's what they are. Here's a cool show you should try, and here's how to get it. Yeah, and it doesn't have to be our show, just any podcast you like in general that you think someone else would like, just share it. Yeah, So get on board the dry pod train. Welcome to stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, This Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there is well Jerry just issappure Chuck did she she did? Oh? There she's back. David copper Fields in here with us as well. Today he made the Statue of Liberty disappear. And now Jerry Jerry as drawn by mc escher. Oh that's nice. How do you feel about optical illusions? I feel I feel happy about optical illusions. I'm not asking Josh from the third grade, but I feel sad about articles on optical illusions in general. It's a it's a really difficult thing to write about, as we're about to demonstrate, it's an even more difficult thing to talk about. Um. But it's just I think the idea that every article has to inherently describe an optical illusion and then basically follows that discrip o shin up with and scientists don't really know what's going on. Here's a couple of guesses that will be fully discredited in twenty years. It's just dissatisfying. Yeah, I mean because we were kind of we're the kind of dudes who like concrete answers or at least like really solid hypotheses. Some of these are flimsy to me. Yeah, So we would encourage folks if you are listening at home or work, because you can blow off work. Let's be honest, um, like, look look up. Some of these will describe them as best we can, and most of them you've probably seen before because as you will learn, uh many many illusions optical illusions were were drawn and conceived many years ago, and I have just been sort of played upon over the years in different ways. Right. Yeah, the nineteenth century was, like the classics, the foundation of optical illusions, which not coincidentally coincided with the foundation of psychology and brain research. Um, and optical illusions were created to kind of test the stuff or explore this stuff, right. But yeah, most of the stuff today are just variations on these themes. Yeah. So, like I was saying, if you're if you're able to just you know, kind of just google this junk as we say them, and you'll go, oh that thing and chuck. Actually, there's a website called Michael Bach dot d E okay might yeah, which is Deutscheland Germany in the English, but it's h M I C H A E l B A c H dot d E. And this guy just listed he's got links to every optical illusion you could possibly imagine. So that'd be a good place to go. Just sit there and click on his site while we're talking about these things. Yeah, and UM, what I found is that I get um a bit of optical illusion fatigue when I look at too many of these things in a row. Oh, well that should be studied. Well, I think that. I mean, we know so little about optical illusions that that is, I mean, that's kind of groundbreaking. Well, I don't mean fatigue is in like scientifically, I just mean like I'm tired of looking at this junk. Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, it just bores me after a bit. Plus a lot of require ugly color combinations or un unpleasant color combinations. So I think that probably contributes to it too. And we should do a We don't talk a lot about Er in this one, but we should. He deserves his own show. Sure, you know Escher and Geiger. Maybe we'll do a combo show with those two. Oh yeah, oh yeah, man, that guy's brain is beautiful. Yeah. There's a lot of cultural icon biographies that are floating out there. Mr Rogers and Dr SEUs. I know we've talked about those. So maybe we'll go on a kick. Okay, I'm ready for some kicking. Alright, so we were Let's go back a little bit to the history of thinking about or study optical illusions. Right, As with most things in the West, the basis of optical illusions of the first mention of optical illusions in the literature comes from the Greeks and Aristotle in particular. Yeah. He uh, he probably munched on some some some weird route and stared at a waterfall for a little while and he said, hey, dudes, if you stare at that waterfall long enough, man, and then you quickly look at that rock, it looks like the rock is moving, right, and then the rocks like, AREM not moving? Aristotle? But that actually has a name, correct, Yeah, it's called the waterfall illusion appropriately or um, what's the other word for it, the motion after effect. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. This is this is like, if this is true the explanation for it, then I'm just disappointed with our our brains hit. The explanation is that when we're staring at the waterfall, are neurons tracking the movement of the water become tired out, exhausted, yeah, overwhelmed. So when we stopped looking at it and they take a break, all the other ones that weren't at work are suddenly working over time and making things move that aren't actually moving right. That's a stupid explanation. Uh, I don't know how buy that. I mean, it makes sense but I think it's stupid, it's boring, you know, just worn out neurons. Yeah, I'm tired to sit down over here. Uh yeah. And then there was, um, if we go forward a bit in the nineteenth century, like you were talking about, there was that that was when people got really sort of interested in studying these things and what was going on in the brain, because it's sort of coincided with um, studying perception and how our eyes worked, and how our eyes worked in relation to our brain. Right. And then I guess what some of the earliest optical illusions kind of proved though, was this longstanding idea that it are perception of vision. Our visual experience was based in how the eyes interpreted objects. And what these early optical illusions started to prove was, no, it's actually the brain that's getting messed up here. And some now we're starting to get into here at this point, like some some theories that that makes sense to me, that I think are cool. But what these this early study started to reveal was that the brain is extremely lazy and it likes to take shortcuts. Right, Yeah, I thought, I thought this is actually pretty interesting. Are you talking about the lag time? The lag time, but also, yeah, there's there's plenty of other stuff, but the lag time seems to me to be like one specific slice of this the general tricks of the trade that the brain uses to cut corners. Yeah, and the lag time is basically, when you know, everything seems to happen instantaneous when you when you look at something, your eyeballs pick it up, the neurons start firing, and the brain tells you, you know, that's a coffee cup. But there's just the slightest little lag and the time it takes for that to happen. And one of the theories with optical illusions is the brain is trying to predict and that slight, slight, slight. You know, I'm not good with small uh. Units of time is nanosecond, Jordana, Yeah, Nana, second is definitely sure, but I think we're talking tenth of a second, Okay, So the brain basically tries to predict what what is should come next based on what we're used to seeing in real life. Is that a good way to say it? Yeah? And the reason they would do this is because a tenth of a second, something can change, like a tiger can suddenly appear. Um, so the brain is constantly looking clues in the environment to to predict what what is that what a tenth of a second in the future is going to be? Like, right, I think things move slow enough for us humans that it usually works pretty well. But what this researcher Mark Changizi says is an optical illusion. Some of the optical illusions are actually reliable ways to trick the brain into making the wrong decision about what the future is gonna hold. One of the ones that that classically falls into this example is um what's the one that that he talks about where it's the It's the one with the so that you've got two parallel lines running horizontally, just you know, separated by a little amount of space, and then in the background there's radial lines all going toward a um the point, the vanishing point on the horizon. Right. Yes, I can't remember the name of this one, but the the point that Changizi makes is that the radial lines, lines that radiate from a center point our brains use as a shortcut indicator of motion, the Herring illusion. Thank you. So these radial lines that we see tell our brain, oh, we're moving and we're moving towards this vanishing point in the distance. So these these horizontal lines that are in the foreground are actually appear to be bent in the center, bent outward from one another very much. So, So what Changizi saying is that the brain is predicting since it thinks we're moving forward towards this point and then toward these lines that as we get closer, they have to bend to basically allow us to enter in another way. But the thing is that they're they're not moving because it's a static image, but it's the brain being tricked into thinking we're moving forward, changing our perspective unnecessarily. Yeah, because the brain is used to the way we move forward in real life. I r L right for you kids out there, and so you know, it's a lot of this seemed like the brain almost kind of negotiating with itself. Yeah, you know, yes, but I think part of it so that lag time one makes sense, right. Another one that makes sense to me as far as why the brain makes shortcuts is that when when like the physical world is in at least three dimensions that we interact with it in, right, but our eyes are giving us two dimensional representations that the brain then has to reconstruct into three dimensions, and it's learned to take all sorts of neat little um, it's neat little clues to put together a pretty good prediction of what it's looking at. Yeah, and and it can also flip flop between different two different views like the is it the Necker cube? I love it any c K E R. And it's it's sort of that classic cube that you learned to draw, the one that's slightly more advanced and than the basic cube that you first learned to draw. It's the second cube that you learned to draw right on your your What was those things that you put on your books and people? Oh, just like yeah, homemade book covers, right exactly. Yeah, basically a brown grocery sack is what I used. Yeah, same here. Uh that's because we were poor. Well plus those those things held up oh sure yeah. Um. So you look at the Necker cube and um. The fun thing about the Necker cube is you you look at it and your brain is able to flip back and forth between the cube basically having two different um uh positions? Is that the best way to say it? I keep saying that, But you know again, these things are kind of hard to describe. Well, yeah, it's kind of like the cube is transparent and you can see all corners of it. Yeah, so you're rain is saying, Okay, is that corner close to me or furthest away from me? It changes perspective. Yeah, and so thanks to UM, to the wonder machine, we can put people in these things and UM see the neurons responsible for the different perspectives, uh, flipping back and forth depending on how we're looking at it. Yeah, exactly. Pretty helpful at this point because you had the nineteenth century where they started to to suss out that the ideas that the brain was responsible for this, it was the brain messing up. And then not a lot happened in between then and the two thousands when f M R I came into UM widespread use. And then now we're starting to see, yeah, this the a lot of these early theories are actually correct because we can see the neurons responsible for them. All Right, Well, let's take a little break here and then we're gonna come back and talk about the Herman illusion and what the Mr I said about that one. Okay, so the Herman Herman I'm not sure how to pronounce that H E R M A N N. The Herman Grid conceived by Ludamore Herman in you nailed this first first name? Oh yeah, Well, it's it's one of those classic illusions that we've all seen and it's really simple. It's just a black and white grid of squares, and that's the one where if you're just looking at it, it looks like there's these little gray circles, little gray dots in between where these things intersect, and there's really nothing there though, of course when you focus on that, it goes away. Uh. And the m R I showed that when you're looking at an illusion like this and others like this, um the neurons are competing with one another to see the light and the dark, and basically one set of neurons wins out over the other and then influences the message to the other. For what you end up perceiving, right, fairly interesting and think it is it is And this one kind of stands on its owner in its own class, and that it's not really the brain that's being duped. It's because of the physiology of the eyes and the light receptors in the eyes. Right, So there are arranged so that they are they they sense distinction, like contrast between light and dark, right, and if they're sensing both, they create this blob. There's spill over where um, some receptors in a single cell um are getting dark and some are getting light. When you can create these blobs in the intersection, but then when you focus your attention on the white part the intersection between the black squares, you're using your phobio receptors, which have far less inhibition or spill over um, so that the gray blob disappears. In what you see is is white. It's actually really I read probably like four different explanations of it before it started to sink in. Yeah, it's straightforward, but it's tough to explain. I think another word. Yeah, and uh, I totally agree. Um. And one of the reasons we know that these neurons are sort of individually picking things up is because in these two dudes, David Hubil and torched In Festal, great name, you're going to say that, uh, in one they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine because they found out that there's actually a process and how the brain uh picks of stuff. Up and and what the I C s. And they found that each neuron is actually responsible for one little part, one little detail of that pattern uh in the retinal image. And so that explains why these neurons can do get out basically on what it's seen. Yeah. So, and it's not just like uh, like neurons competing seeing light and dark. It's it's from what I understand the the understanding of our brain and vision is that an individual neuron is responsible for, um, say a circle, It sees circles, and it's transmitting any circular information to the brain. Another neuron is responsible for seeing dark, another is responsible for seeing light, another's responsible for seeing red, another is responsible for seeing texture, and all of this sensory information, this visual information is coming to the brain all at once, and these various brain regions responsible for vision putting it together the best way it can. You see a red ball. And there's a lot of cues that the brain uses that just fascinate me. For basically what's called monocular vision. Right, so when you are using both of your eyes, especially when something's up close, you're getting two separate pictures of the same thing, and the differences between these pictures the brain can use to easily translate it into three dimensions, right to to to handle things like perspective and stuff like that. But when something's further away, um, the brain has to use other little tricks of the trade. Right. So you've got things like inner position. That's a pretty straight up one where if one objects in front of another object, your brain says, well, the object that's behind is further away. Yeah. Is that is that what explains like force perspective? Yes? In art, Yes, right, I do like force perspective stuff I do. It's kind of cool, it's neat stuff. I guess that's that's probably part of the op art movement, right, Uh, yeah, when it was at like sixties and seventies. Yeah, it seems like yeah. And then you know, kind of coincided with drugs, right, not surprisingly. And then there's another one that I hadn't heard of, called atmospheric perspective. Had you heard of that one? I had not. So. Atmospheric perspective is, um, it's basically the dust, particles in the water, vapor in the air. The further something is a way, the more of an effect those things have on the detail you see. If it so your brain says, well, that's a little blurry. Uh, that's that's a far away object. And then there's there's plenty of other ones, but the gold standard is um is object size. Right, that's where you um, you know that roughly the size of an object, and you can use it to compare to see whether it's it's far away or close, depending on whether it's small or large, or if you don't know the size of an object, but you know two objects are identical and one is smaller than the other, well, then you know the smaller one is further away. So the brain is like constantly using all of these little cues and tricks to put together a conception of what it's seeing at any given point in time. And then what what um optical allusions are are Again these things you can produce to to reliably trick the brain into making these wrong decisions. That that shows its hand. It reveals how the brain functions to take these shortcuts and the tricks that uses. Right, Like a brain you think you're so smart, you're really dumb. Look at this, and the brain says, oh, stop looking, stop looking at those things, look at normal things. Um kind of like sorry, I kind of like the apparent motion ones, although I can't look at a lot of them. Um, those are the ones where something is drawn in such a way that it looks like it's moving when it's not right. The very famous snake illusion is a great example. And you know, this is another one of those theories that to me is a little weak. But one of the theories is that, um, they're these almost like unnoticeable rapid eye movements that we make. Uh how do you pronounce that? Yeah, no, s A C C A D E s YEA CICADs the cads. I think you could probably get away with either one. All right, Well that's what they're called. And uh, it's it's like Pruett Taylor Vince syndrome. You remember him. Yeah, he's a great actor, Yeah he is. Um, so those little movements he usually get smoothed out by the brain, so we you know, get like a static picture. But um, what it's causing in this case is perceiving motion where there was no motion. And then the other theory on this one for apparent motion illusions is there's just so much information going on that uh, you know, there's just confusion. Right. I saw one that actually combined the two that that's basically said, Um, the the CICADs are creating the illusion of motion, but what they're really doing is because the brain is being hit with all this visual information that is just totally doesn't make sense that we never never happen in nature except maybe in motion. That these CICADs actually each time your eye makes this tiny movement, it refreshes this overwhelming um overload of information onto the brain, which creates the sensation of movement. Oh yeah, pretty cool. Well, one of the cool aspects of all of this to me is um is the fact that once you've once you've seen the illusion and the trick to it, you can't undo that, right, So the brain is like a, ha, you know, I got this one, like you know, the famous one, the old lady or the or the young woman, the black and white. It's a you know, classic illusion. And once you you know, you can stare at and be like, I just see the young lady or I just see the old lady. Once you've seen both, then your brain has like I said, it says ah, and it files that away as prior knowledge and a little folder in the brain and you can't undo that. So once you've seen it, and you've seen the trick. You can aways look at it and kind of make that flip in your mind, right exactly. And it's the same thing too with them contour less figures. Where is it a wine goblet or is it two people's faces facing one another? Kind of thing? Right? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you know the negative space. Yeah, And apparently the trick to those is you focus on the black or the white and you see whichever one appears to be in the foreground, because what your brain is doing is saying, um, I need a foreground and I need a background, and then I've got something to work with, and depending on what it's which one it's looking at, it decides this is the foreground or this is the background. So it's either a wine goblet in the foreground or it's two people's faces in the foreground. You know, I wonder if this stuff if they know anything about because they didn't see anything in the research, but if they know anything that that this is like a brain exercise and helps you out, like you know, playing suduco or doing word puzzles, or if the brain is like stop looking at these, you know, I don't like this I can't take anymore, you know, or you know, like literally maybe, or if it causes stress on the brain by by taxing it in a way that it is not accustomed to or doesn't say it doesn't like. Obviously the brain doesn't have a you know, it's not a little person, but you know what I'm saying. Yeah, no, I know what you mean. But the brain, even if it's not a little person, it could still not like things. Right, So let's take another break and then, um, I want to tell everybody what my favorite optical illusion of all time is. Alright, chuck, Yeah, I'm ready. Well there's two one I like slightly less than the other. Okay, so start with the second place one. Okay, I knew you were gonna say that. I think that's a great way to do it too. So you've got um, I don't know the name of it. I'm sure there is a name, but actually I think it's the contour less figure as well. You take three circles, and you cut a pie slice out of all of them, like a pac man, and you orient those pie slices so that each one forms what appears to be the corner of a coherent square, and you look at it, and you're like, well, there's a square right there with some that's overlaying four circles. But if you stop and think about it, there's no line whatsoever that that makes that square. It's your brain exclusively filling in some suggestible information to say, well, there's a square over a field of four circles. It's pretty neat to me. I like that one. Uh so what's what's number one? Um? Yeah, it's called the Addleston checkerboard. Okay, surely you've seen this one, right, So I'm looking it up as we speak. It's from the nineties. There was an M I. T Vision researcher named Edward Addolson and um, he created this checkerboard where on the checkerboard there's you know, dark and light squares like a normal checkerboard, and then there's like I think, a cylinder on the checkerboard and it's casting a shadow. And so um, he says, look at this white square and then look at this black square, um, which is lighter, which is darker. And you say, well, that's easy. The darker square, figure B say, is obviously darker than figure A. And he says that's wrong, that's absolutely wrong. Figuring and figure B are exactly the same color and shade. Um, I'm looking at it. I've seen that one for sure. The whole thing. Um, it really really works because it takes it takes advantage of two different um tricks that you can play on the brain, or it takes advantage of two different shortcuts the brain makes. Right. One is that cylinder is casting a shadow, that's putting appears to be putting Figure A into um well into a shadow. Right, So your brain automatically makes assumptions that if something is in a shadow, it would normally be lighter, which is in this case an incorrect assumption. It's actually the same shade as the other one. And then the other assumption that's making is that because that square is surrounded by um squares of a darker color, uh, and it seems and it's in a shadow, it seems to contrast it where the other figure figure B is a dark square surrounded by light. Uh, it seems to be darker because of the it's surrounded, because the context of the squares that it's surrounded by. So your brain is using two different things, the presence of a shadow and then the context where if something is surrounded by lighter stuff, it seems darker. If something surrounded by darker stuff, it seems lighter. UM. And that's just not always the case, obviously, because Edward Adolson proved it's not. So you want to know My favorite the classic Ebbing House illusion E B B I N G H A U s uh. This one is sort of similar, but it's not so much about color, but it uses adjacent objects and a lot of these do too. They use other things surrounding something to trick your brain. Uh. And in this case, it's it's the classic one. Go look it up. It's the UM. You have two orange dots. One on the left, let's say, uh, is surrounded by six larger gray dots, and the other one on the right is surrounded by eight smaller dots. It's very simple, that's why I love it. And the orange dots are the same size, but they look completely different sizes, and it's just it's so simple. And I think this is one of the one is that UM and too they have this contest every year, I think for like, I don't know, it's been going on for at least ten or twelve years, right, uh for new illusions and like we said earlier. You know, a lot of these new illusions are still just sort of riffs on the classics. Um. But the one that won a couple of years ago was a new version of the ebbing House illusion where um, it's actually a video that you have to play, so it moves. Um that the outer dots they it looks like at pulsates and uh, well it is pulsating. They get bigger and smaller, and the orange dots stays the same, but it looks like it's shrinking and expanding, right, So it's kind of cool. It's just to just to play on the ebbing House illusion. But that's that's what we were saying earlier too. It's like it's almost like they invented all of them in the nineteenth century and then now we're just able to perfect him a little more. Yeah, pretty cool. Another thing I thought was really neat was that there's this biological basis that is the same for everyone on planet Earth, obviously, but they did find there some across different cultures that they didn't take the same visual cues necessarily. And the classic Mula Layah illusion that everyone has seen, and that's just the really simple one of two straight lines, horizontal lines, uh, and they have arrows on the ends. On one of them, the arrows are pointing out. On the other the arrows are pointing in. And those two horizontal lines appear to be different links. And so they did a study in South Africa and they found that most of the European South Africans thought, yeah, like, look at them, they're different links. Then they showed it to like, you know, the bushmen of South Africa, and they're like, no, dummies, they're the same weak can't you see that? And the researchers are like what yeah, and they really, I mean, they had some theories about it. Uh. That kind of makes and so that Western societies may be a little more used to these things that are built in straight lines and a little more geometrical, where the other culture might be like just more attuned to nature where there aren't so many straight lines. Right. And because the explanation for the what was it, the Meyer the mula, the Mueller liar effect, or optical illusion is that depending on which way the arrow was pointing, whether at the at the end of the line or away from the line um, the brain is used to seeing corners right. Two walls coming together at a ceiling make that that same kind of arrow, and one that's pointing away means the point of it is further away, so it would make the line look longer, whereas one that's pointing inward would make it look like the corners closest to us, right, so it would seem like the line is shorter. But but the explanation was that, well, bushman, have never seen two walls come together at the ceiling, so that's why it didn't happen to them. But the thing that just proved that is that, um, they trained UH computer to to look at this stuff, and they didn't train it on three dimensional objects, so it wasn't familiar with walls coming together with the ceiling, and it was fooled by it as well. So they were like, well, we we have no idea. What's going on? Then, bushman or magic is what they said. I wonder why so many of these UH illusion UH enthusiasts seemed to be like German and Austrian. I think I had to do. That was where the UH largely where psychology took off. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I guess Escher was Dutch buzzy but um, yeah, it seems like a lot of these are like German and Austrian. Yeah. I think it has to do with that was where the hot seat of psychology and brain research was at the time. Interesting, h you got anything else? Actually I do have one more. There was um a guy named Hermann von helm Holtz. Oh he wasn't German, right, No, nice Irish guy who's from Indiana. Von Helmholtz came up with these um squares right that are not Actually they don't have confining lines or defining lines. They're just equal lines of squares or lines lines equally apart that formed to the brain a square. But ones that are horizontal seems smaller and shorter than ones that are vertical, which is weird because if you are wearing like a horizontally striped shirt, everybody's like, you look fat in that shirt. Well, von Helmholtz, you don't. You should actually look slimmer, which surprised me. So I started wearing horizontal stripes as a result. You got your Charlie brown shirt out. Yeah, because that was sort of the old I don't know if it's true or not, but they said that the New York Yankees designed their pin stripes to make Babe Ruth look thinner. I could totally buy that, but I don't know if that's true. I thought they had been stripes before then. But Babe Ruth was eating a steak while they were fitting him for and he said, thanks for thinking of me. But he wasn't even using silver. Is he eating it with his hand? Yeah? And he also, um uh, blended a steak into a milkshake and drank that along with his regular steak, right, And he didn't take a cigar out while he drank it. He just put that in the corner of his mouth. Yeah, And it's after dinner cognac. That's why we love Babe Ruth. Ye, you know what, we didn't get into it all. And I don't know if they even count as illusions or if there's something else or those and they were a boy, they were all the rage and the early nineties I feel like were those um magic I yeah, where you stare at the thing and all of a sudden a ship pops out at you. If you're you know, lucky enough to be able to see it. I know a lot of people that would just endlessly not be able to see him, and it would frustrate them to no end. I think, if I remember correctly, they advised that you stare into the middle ground. Yeah, and sort of like unFocus your eyes. Yeah, I was looking those up. Um. There's a Mental Floss article on it that was pretty brief and it made sense. I think they were machine vision learning researchers who were like, hey, let's make some money on the side if they start with like a depth map of something and put it in gray scale. And I think they make two of them, so your eyes are getting the two different versions of it, but one smaller than the other, so it really makes it pop as far as depth goes. And then somehow the random repeating pattern that overlays it transmits that information to your brain unconsciously. Well, so you did look it up, then I did. I don't know if I got it fully right because it's it's actually kind of complex, but I thought they did a pretty good I would describe me. Could you see those? Yeah? Sometimes sometimes Yeah, I always could see them. And that's another one of those where once you see it you can just immediately like draw it out. Um. And of course that's there's the one Ethan's supply and mall Rats sort of the one joke through that movie. It was he just stares at this thing like through the whole movie and he couldn't see it. I couldn't see it, poor guy. What a great joke, you know, speaking of that something that's always bothered me. Stephen King said, and one of his books or something like that, he was talking about how you can't unsee something. I thought you said, he's talking about Mall Rats. He was, and he he used the Man in the moon as an example. He's like, it's like the man in the moon. Once you see it, you can't unsee it, right can I Like, I've seen the man in the moon before and I totally can't find him again, so you can un see it. Stephen King is wrong? What is the man in the moon? What are you talking about? You've never seen the man in the moon now, so I guess probably look it up. I think it would help to see somebody else pointing it out. And then when you see the when you look at the full moon, you you should be able to see it. But there's a man looking down. It's Jackie Gleeson. I don't think are you looking it up right now? Yeah? I'd never do that was a thing that's weird. And then the Japanese think it's a rabbit and that the rabbit is up there making mochi. Really, I don't know what other cultures think. Those are the two I'm familiar with. Huh yeah, so mochi. All right, if you want to know more about optical illusions, type those words into the search bar at how stuff works better yet, go to Michael Bach dot d E and just have some fun. Uh. And since I said d E, it's time for a listener mail. I'm gonna call this Aussie slang. We love our and I said Aussie. I met Aussie, right, we love our Australian listeners. We've got a lot of them. They've long supported the show, so we'd like to shout them out. Yeah, Australia. Uh, he said, get eye, fellas. That's pretty good. I'm not gonna read the whole thing like that, but I will just nailed Canberra. I'm a debut a listener from down on and I'm doing my best to get through your podcast. I love the show and finish every show with a smile and some new fact to tell my mates about. Anyway, I got a quick story for you to have a laugh at and possibly be very confused by the Other night, my mate and I were going on a uh Marcus run M A C C A S. I think we've talked about that before, right, didn't that beer? I don't know? Uh Fosters was us Chilian? And he goes, OHI mate, after we've been to Macus, we can drop by the sub grab a packet dairies and then the bottle. I'll grab a slab of EV Studies and head back to yells and get piste. Okay, so let me let me oi mate, Hello friend, after we've been to Marcus after I don't know what that was. Next, can we dropped by the servo? We can go hang out with Tom Servo. I bet you anything. A servo is like a gas station. Grab a pack of dirries, Uh, get some milk and then the bottle. Oh uh, get a bottle, grab a slab of v B Studies, get some ribs. I think I think that's it, uh, and head back to yours and get pissed uh and then go to sleep. I think you're right on the money. Yeah, I know you guys don't often do request be rad If you guys did a podcast on Aussie slang's history and meanings, mostly because I would love to hear Chuck's Aussie accent. Oh well yeah, granted he didn't wait, he didn't translate it himself now, so we'll never know whether I was completely right. Someone someone will uh. And I'd love to hear both of you pronounced as much Assie slang as possible. But also because i'd like to have facts about why I speak the way I do. Stay rad And that is from Liam and he said, ps, we swear a lot down here. Uh. And if that's why you can't do an Aussie slang podcast, I don't blame you. Well, I swear a lot.
