Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles w Chuck Bryant, there's Jerry. I predicted this will be the best podcast of the new year. Man, I don't know about that one, and I think that prediction is coming true. And the first month when Gray Filled the Sky, the recorders of Gobbledygook hit high water mark. It's a little on the nose for Nostre Damas. Actually it's I should have been even more vague, like way vaguer. Yeah, that was like explicit for him. Yeah, because no, stredamis used to like to just basically take concepts and words and put them together and pretend like they were going to happen. Yeah, no, Stredomas snort a little nutmeg. I Um. When I was a younger person, I realized like from this and esp that, uh, I was into some pretty cool occult stuff. Read lots of books about ghosts and things like that. Meet you a little bit. And then now it's like an older person like I wanted to go to Duke University to study parasychologist. I was into like that kind of way. And then now as an older person, I'm like, and some of the things I used to believe just do a faith palm here there, Like for example, we got into real science, and that's usually what happens. Yes, so the pseudoscience is kind of fade away and once you start educating yourself. Well, we shouldn't say parasychology is necessarily as pseudoscience. It's not. We're here to poopoo. No stradomas, not esp paras psychology in general. But for instance, you were I remember not only believing, but frequently saying, dude, no stredamus. He had to be exu oomed once, like at the church he was buried at. They were like expanding and they had to exume his grave and they opened his casket and he was holding a tablet that had the day they exhumed him. I thought that was real. I thought that really happened. When I was a slightly younger man. That's awesome when you are in your late twenties, right, Yeah, I remember I didn't read up on stuff like this, but I was a big fan of like literary moys in search of and TV shows that kind of dabbled in the fringe and what's wrong with that? Nothing, There's nothing wrong with enjoying that kind of thing, liking it, been wondering if possibly some of it could be real. Nothing wrong with the exploration, right, But the key to keeping egg off your face as much as possible is to doing research, especially when a claim is very extraordinary, really look into it, Like had I had I looked around, had the Internet been invented yet, and I looked around, and I probably would have found somewhere some entries saying like that is absolutely not true. Well, that's one of the Internet is one of the big reasons, I think, because before that was around, you know, it's you'd have to go search out a book that was written, including Nostradamas in the card catalog, and uh, it was just a lot harder back then, you know. Yeah, But the Internet is a double edged fiber optic line. I mean, there's a lot of sites out there that I mean, No Stredamas has gotten probably even more popular and even more play since the Internet was invented, you know. Yeah, So let's talk about this guy. Let's try to separate the man from the myth and really get into who No stre Damas was. Because he was a lot more than a crack pot writer of vague predictions. That's true. He was. One of the tough parts is though, is that there are so many disagreements about his biography, even Um I didn't find that necessarily. Yeah, I saw one guy wrote a book at him that said he wasn't even a doctor. Oh, okay, that is a disagreement. Yeah, well let's go ahead and go there then. Okay. So he was supposedly born in fifteen oh three. No, not true. In France, he was born Michelle de Nostre Dame. He became Nostre Damis because he latinized his name after he graduated medical school, which apparently was custom at the time. That's right. But when he was born he was Michelle de Nostradam. Yeah, and he was his family was educated and they believed in education. So he was from an early age an academic in a traditional sense. Um, nothing wacky right out of the gate. Well, his grandfather um instructed him as when he was a younger man, taught him languages and kind of sparked his interest in all sorts of different topics and all things learning. Yeah, and do you remember when we did the Inquisition UM episode where there are a lot of Jewish people who converted, but just converted in name only. Apparently Nostra Damis his family was one of those. Oh so that wasn't a genuine conversion supposedly not Again, it could be myth, it could be whatever. Because he was on good terms with the local inquisition uh and the local church officials for most of his life. So I guess either they didn't suspect him, or they he had a pass. I don't know. Oh, that's interesting, that makes sense. Uh. He studied a straw no, I'm sorry, astrology um, which was UM at the time, respected well respected as a science and um and supposedly his fellow astrologers thought he was full of it. His contemporary astrologer pals Well, one of the things that he did was he studied and this would play out throughout his Uh well, I would say his career as a predictor. But he really just wrote the book, the Centuries book, which we'll get to. But he studied astronomical patterns that coincided with historical events. That's astrology. Well yeah, but he he would basically use those to predict the future of it. Like by some accounts he didn't even say that he was a prophet. He said, I study history, and basically history repeats itself, and so I'm going to use the stars and when these things line up pattern wise in a certain year in the future, this may happen again. Yeah. So I'm that's like real astrology. Yeah, we should do an episode on that. Yeah, I've been thinking about that one for a while. This one, well, the the article we have like almost like spits in the middle. It's so one sided and skeptical. It's just a picture of a big lube, right. But I looked into Um, I looked into it and like, there's the It's fascinating what they used to believe in all of the holes you can punch in it, you know. But um, it's a pretty We should do that for sometime. Yeah. I had my chart done one time, like for real by my friend's mom, and um, I remember looking at it and thinking like, wow, that's a lot like me. Yeah, it's pretty accurate. But and even even remove that last part, the amount of thought and effort in what it's based on, in the ancient tradition of it and everything that in and of itself is fascinating, you know. And then you can get into we're totally doing astrology at some point. But um, so what he was doing was astrology. Apparently where he ran a foul of his fellow astrologers was to make predictions of how something would come about. Rather than the next time Venus is in the seventh House of Mars and a cat catches fire, um, the there's gonna be an earthquake something like that, he went further and like made predictions about you know, what was going to set this off, and like where the people involved we're going to come from, and like um, and then he was very very vague. So all of that added to the astrologers disdained for him because he gave him a bad name pretty much because they were all right exactly uh so uh he left home, supposedly in uh to study medicine legit medicine and became a physician. Most people agree that he became a professor in a physician in southern France, and apparently it was pretty good doctor uh at treating plague victims. He's very ahead of his time. Yeah, even though he lost his wife and son, I'm sorry, his children to the plague and yeah, and that had a big effect on his life. Obviously, he basically sent him on the road for a decade um, which is where he kind of came up with this uh plan to write this book. So he um he was he was a progressive doctor in that like he prescribed sanitation practices, um, he prescribed fresh air. Um. He also apparently came up with a rose hip lozenge to help cure plague, mild cases of plague, and that actually makes sense because rose hips are packed of vitamin C. So he was a pretty good doctor and had a good record. And from that he lived in this village with his wife and children and had a patron who basically supported the family. And then once his wife and children died, he couldn't cure them. His star really fell in this village. And about the same time, he also had a pretty good sense of humor. About the same time, they were raising a statue of the Virgin Mary in the local church, and he thought it was the ugliest thing he'd ever seen. And he was making a comment on the artist's abilities, not the Virgin Mary, but he said, these guys are casting demons, like basically saying, that's a really ugly Virgin Mary. Well, the artist didn't like this and turn him into the Inquisition and that's about the time when he ended up on the road. Yeah, and he went all over Europe. Um just uh. Basically he was described as sort of wandering, but he did meet another woman, uh and get remarried on his wanderings, I think towards the tail end of his wanderings about eight years later, and moved to Salon uh in France, and then he started kind of getting his uh, getting his act together in in a in a real way to publish. Like he he he said, you know what, I'm gonna put together this book of prophecies. I've been messing around, I've been kicking the idea and I'm just gonna do it. So we'll talk about what came out of that. Right after this, So Chuck Nostre Damas is settling down in Salon Salon, Yeah, selectives and um he is deciding to put his awesome thoughts down into quatrains that's right, into a book called the Centuries. But at the time he just called it the Prophecies. Yeah, the Prophecies of Michelle Nostradamis. I think when did they rename it? Um, I think after his death. Yeah, And apparently the centuries had nothing to do with time, but it was in the structure, the organized structure of the book itself, because there a thousand quatrains dreds for some reason. So that's the centuries. And it wasn't it wasn't chronological or anything like that. No, And it was, um, it was a It became a huge sensation due to a few things. Um. One, simply enough was that the printing press was a recent invention and books were a big deal now, you know, like widespread books like there was now something could literally be a best seller for the first time. So it aligned in that way. And another is that he just sort of fit the dark times. It was a book for and of its time, with all his dire predictions. It was you know, when the Catholics and Protestants were warring and there were all kinds of people saying the end of the world was coming, and it was just it was basically put out right at the right time and widespread because of the printing press. And then Queen Catherine de Medici of France was a really superstitious queen, and um, he predicted her husband Henry the seconds death, yeah, pretty specifically for once. Yeah, but we'll poke holes on that too. Um, And it happened a few years later, and so she invited him to the court, which was like the most popular court in Europe at the time, and so he got a lot of attention there. So he was sort of like a big uh writing superstar of his day because of all these things. All yeah, I mean, like he wasn't one of those posthumously honored authors like he was celebrated during this time. Supposedly he met some monks on the road once and um correctly said that one of them was going to be the next pope. Bam case salved No Astronomicus is the real deal, because that supposedly happened. So um, he had like a whole whole jam going where he would retire in the evenings and um, he would concentrate on maybe a fire, the flames of a fire, yeah, or he would take a bowl with some herbs or something in it and just zone out on those, try to read the herbs. Like you said, I don't know if he was doing lines of nutmeg, but he was ingesting nutmeg most likely, yeah, which could be hallucinogenic, right, and he had to have been rich to just be doing nutmeg, you know, um, because they had just discovered that. Um. And he would just kind of zone out. He would apparently he got help from an angelic figure, that's what he says, and then he he would just see the future. It would come to him. The thing is is no str Damas. These prophecies didn't come to him, all convoluted and kukie and however he put them, he understood exactly what was going to happen. Well, he supposedly convoluted them on purpose to avoid persecution during his lifetime. Yeah, that is supposedly what he told his son from a second marriage that, yeah, doing all this on purpose. And um, because they will, you know, string me up as a heretic because I'm so you really accurate, they will find out, which I mean at the time, it was a genuine concern. So it's it's not like this is just a preposterous claim on no stredamss part. It's just that for skeptics of no Stredamas, it's just one more venient little thing because if you read the quad trains, they make almost no sense in all sense. Simultaneously. Yeah, depending on whether you're reading them on their own or whether you're trying to look at them in context. Well, yeah, well we might as well go and talk about that. That's one of the big reasons you can poke holes in it is because there were even experts say, it's hard to find two copies of this book that are the same. Yeah, because it was translated, you know, hundreds of times. It was the early printing presses were you know, they weren't super accurate, and they would if the printer maybe didn't know exactly what he meant, they would say, well, I think he meant to actually have an apostrophe here, and in Middle French, that apostrophe could completely change the meaning of the word um. So beyond that confusion and the translation confusions, there are, like you said, there are many different ways to enter for something, and if something didn't come true, you could probably find a version out there of it that supports whatever you think he predicted. You know. Yeah, there's a pretty good example that people give of a translation problem um after nine eleven, which we'll talk more about in a second. They some some quatrain of or I guess an assemblage of no sudamisis quad trains were kind of bandied about his proof that he predicted it right. One of them was there would be smoke in the new city. Well, in his actual text in the centuries he wrote Villaneuve Vienneuve, which means in French the new city, But it was also a city in France at the time that he was probably talking about. So there's a lot of translation and interpretation that can come together and really lead to a misunder standing. If there is even such a thing at all with Nostre Damas. Can you misunderstand him? I don't think it's possible. Can you misunderstand what's not understandable? Yeah, Well, since we're talking about interpreting, we might as well go onto the famous Hitler prediction. Beasts ferocious with hunger will across the rivers. The greater part of the battlefield would be against into a cage of iron. Iron will the great one be drawn from the child of Germany? Observes the man. I wouldn't I hope we added some effect to that, Jerry, Yes, vocal effects, Yeah, something menacing maybe, or maybe we should do like clown music. Um so histor this was has long been looked at as the prediction of the rise of Hitler. Yeah, he says Germany in there. Yeah, it's Germany and histor Um. But histor was actually the lower Danube River, and so most people, um or skeptics would say, well, he didn't say Hitler, he said Hstor since that was a place, Um, that's probably what he meant. Or he would have said Hitler. Yeah, it's kind of a miss right there. Um some people say, well, Hitler was born around the Danube, so he still met Hitler. That's exactly the point is that people will find a way to interpret it if they choose to. But the Nazis still use this to their advantage. They actually dropped pamphlets containing this prediction onto France from plains because they wanted to scare them, like, hey, even Nostradama said we're coming, and we're coming, and it worked. I guess it did for a while. So there's basically the if you're a skeptic of Nostradamus, you say, Okay, first of all, he's not really saying anything or anything crete, right, And a believer of Nostre Dams would say, well, he even said that, you're not supposed to get it. Unless you're one of the enlightened, few can happen to be one of them. It's not for this time. It's for people far from now to understand. And so the skeptic that's arguing wild sigh and then say, okay, um, here's the thing though, even if, even if he is saying something like even though, if there's something clear, he's making a prediction, and it does seem to come true if you look at events in human history as numbers on a graph. Eventually, statistically speaking, one of nostre dams is very vague predictions about the rise of a power, a war, an earthquake, something like that is going to happen, and maybe something will have even a couple of predictions that will fit one event, like the date might align somehow something because every once while he used dates, but for the most part he didn't. Um. But if you look at it statistically, yes, even Nostradamis's predictions are going to come true over a long enough period of time. If again, if you read the predictions, it's hard to say his predictions come true because he's not really predicting anything. It's not like he sat back and said, uh, sometime in the twentieth century, a guy with a terrible mustache is going to come to power and there's going to be a a horrific war as a result. Nothing even approaching that. I mean, you read what the Hitler prediction was like, it could be anything. But even if you have predicted something, if you take his predictions as predictions, if you put them over the arc of time, eventually you're gonna get hit. So that's one argument. A skeptical argument against no stredamis yeah, especially if you believe um, like most people do, that history repeats itself in some fashion over a long enough timeline. When he himself said that that's the model he used, was using the stars to look at past historical events to predict future events, So it kind of makes sense. Um. And also some people say these aren't even predictions because the prediction is something that you realize before the fact. Uh. And despite the fact that thousands of scholars have studied Nostre Damas and millions of people have read him, no one has ever pointed out something before it happened. It's always afterwards that they go back and see, look, see here he said this was gonna happen, and it happened because we interpreted that way. But no one's ever said stopped anything in its tracks because No Stredamas predicted it as an excellent point. You know, it also raises another argument against um nostre Damas, and that the people who follow no streams, like you said, it's always the interpretation is always after the fact, and allegations of shoehorning occur where basically you make something fit, you've shoehorn it in to the cont x and in doing so you cherry pick stuff that makes sense and you ignore stuff that doesn't make sense. Yeah. In fact, I think this article, this one line says it best imprecise language lends itself well to subjective interpretation. Yeah. I mean, if you throw something super vague out there, you could come up with a hundred different interpretations of it. You know, that's what poetry is exactly. And you know, uh, despite all of these very great arguments, there's still plenty of people out there who believe in No Stredamas. Almost seems like there should be a phase in life where you do go through believing that No Tredamas is real, because it does kind of lend some sort of something to life. It also coincides with being really into Pink Floyd exam it's true. So um, we'll talk a little more about some of the people who argue for and against no stre damas specifically centered around nine eleven. Right after this, okay, Chuck, nine eleven happened, and almost immediately people said, Nostra dam has predicted this. Yeah, his sales went through the roof apparently, and supposedly his name was Google's more than Usama bin Laden or George Bush after nine eleven. Really, that's what they say. That sounds like something someone just writes on the internet exactly, but I believe it. Well, here's why his star rose again is because this quatrain emerged where it was like, yeah, that's pretty close to what happened. Yeah. I remember hearing it and thinking, oh my gosh, so you want to read this one. You're pretty good at reading. Can we get the sound effect again? Please heep the clown music. In the City of God, there will be a great thunder, two brothers torn apart by chaos, while the fortress endures. The great leader will become the third. Big will begin when the big city is burning. That's super specific Yeah. The only thing I don't know if most people would agree on is calling New York the City of God or George Bush the Great Leader. Yeah. Uh, but the two brothers, clearly those are the two towers. The Fortress endures, the Pentagon. Uh, the Great Leader Bush, Yes, some people said, and then the third war will begin when the big city is burning. Well, at least one more war. I don't know if it was World War three, but a pretty huge couple of wars started up as a result. So people are saying, here it is finally evidence that shows almost incontrovertibly that Nostre Thomas was the real deal. What's the argument against the chuck? Well, it was made up. Yeah, Nostre Thomas didn't write that. Now, it was apparently written by um several years ago by a guy named Neil Marshall was a student in Canada, and said he was actually using that as a demonstration and of what Bunk Nostre Damas was like. I could write something like this and people would think he predicted nine eleven, and somehow it became something that no stre Damas wrote. He actually proved it by writing there and then it getting picked up in two thousand one. So what he set out to do worked perfectly. He and you have to wait more than four years. So he basically showed just how um man. I hate to use this word, but global people can be when they're reading. No stre damas is work because no one checks anything. Dude. They see it and they click on it and they post it to social media and then it's done. And here's a here's another really good example of that a little while ago. This still cracks me up. ClickHole you know the onions like, uh, BuzzFeed like site? Oh is that onion? Yeah? I didn't know that, I believe so yeah, I'm almost positive I know. ClickHole Yeah, okay, so ClickHole satirical site of buzzfeedee charts. Um, they released something called five Tragedies Weirdly predicted by Adam Sandler, and dude, they are so can I read a couple? So, in the wake of the tragedy, um, apparently people went back and saw that Adam Sandler, during his early stand up career, would mutter something's coming to Waco, something dark like during his stand up show. Is that true? None of this is? Okay? I thought they just picked apart real things and no, okay. So car crash that killed Princess Diana. Apparently if you go back and watch Happy Gilmore, which was made in Sandler looks directly in the camera and says our Queen's eldest, the beautiful flower will will under a Parisian bridge. Can I keep going? So the BP oil spill that happened in two in the Gulf, apparently Adam Sandler was on Conan O'Brien in two thousand five and he was just wearing a T shirt that said BP oil spill. In five years the two thousand ten Haitian earthquake, the UN estimates that two d two thousand, five hundred seventy people were killed. Apparently in Adam Sandler's Funny People, he estimated two hundred and twenty thousand on the notes. And then lastly, in Malaysia Airlines flight three seventy, Adam Sandler um when he was operaman, there was a operaman sketch where he says, I'm missing plane. It's from Malaysia. Makes me insane. This will all make sense in due time. Here's the thing, man, people believe that viral. I'm not kidding you. It went viral that like somehow Adam Sandler had made all these crazy predictions and this is a real thing. Apparently they didn't announce that when click Bait came out that it was a satirical site that bp oil spill and the teachers pretty good. Um, well, let's get into some of these then. Uh. First of all, to further the nine eleven thing, there were a couple of um other quatrains which have been cobbled together to try and support the nine eleven thing. Um. But like I said, they weren't as he wrote them. They like would combine things, which is just silly because that goes against everything that he was saying was each quatrain is its own thing. Uh, one of them century ten Quatrain seventy two. Uh. The year seven months from the sky will come the Great King of Terror to resuscitate the Great King of the Mongols before and after Mars reigns. By good luck. That last part sounds like it's from a fortune cookie. Um that before nine eleven, back in nineteen ninety nine, some people for he was for telling the end of the world would be on July. And I remember this happening, and I remember it being a big deal. There was like genuine concern from some people, like some stores and France had like closeout sales. There was this one um French designer who like canceled his big uh. He was a big believer and he canceled this big show. And of course it didn't happen, and then it was recalculated and everyone said, no, no, no no, no. It was this supposed to be July twenty four. If you read it this way, it means August eleven, and of course the world didn't and then either August. How do you get August eleventh from seven months in the ninet Well again it was there were some different translations that maybe we're different enough to ye. But then that one was also used for nine eleven, was repurposed for nine eleven, right there, like he was this close, yeah, a couple of years off. Well, they combined that one with Century six Quatrain ninety seven, which says, at forty five degree reason, this guy will burn fire to approach the great new city. In an instant, a great scattered flame will leap up when one will want to demand proof of the normans. What is that last thing? I'm not sure that's the thing, Like you can't just pick part of it and then discount the rest and say that, you know, he was wrong on that, But that's exactly what people did. Well they did because Um several quatrains referred to an anti christ figure called Mabus, and if you rearrange the letters, it could be Usam b and so people use that as proof. But they also didn't they failed to mention that previous to that, they used it as Saddam, like up to the day before even yeah, they were saying it was Saddam Hussein was Maba's because maybe it's spell backwards a su bomb kind of a reach if you ask me, it is well, in that forty five degrees part of the quad trains, some people said that New York cities around forty degrees five minutes north latitude, so that's close. But again he was said the new city UM will burn at forty five degrees Villanueva or vienneuve Um is that about forty five degrees latitude? So it could just be interpretation. I don't know who's really at fault here. Is it nostre damas? Is it the people who UM just blindly accept no damas predictions? Is it though, because Nostre Damas purposefully obfuscated his stuff. So I think he's a little bit responsible for this too. I imagine since he has that great sense of humor. It made fun of that one guy's statue of the Virgin Mary. He is sitting in his coffin holding a plaque with some future date when he'll be exhumed. His laughing and laughing maybe. Uh. We mentioned Henry the second he predicted his death. Um this quatrain, Uh, the young lion will overcome the old one on the field of battle in single combat. He will put his eyes in a cage of gold two fleets one than to die in a cruel death. So that means two injuries. And this actually happened. King Henry was in a jousting competition, but it wasn't on the field of battle. It was a friendly. It was a party basically. And Uh, Captain Montgomery, who was younger, the younger lion did joust hit hit him in the in the eye and through the throat. So the two injuries supposedly from one. Yeah, but that was all that his his wife de Medici, Queen Demanici, needed to know. She was like, you know, Holy crap. This has come true and he knows what he's doing. John F. Kennedy, The Challenger, the Great Fire of London. People have said that he's predicted all these things. But we could sit here all day poking holes in the you know that, not that we're poking holes, but other people have poked legitimate holes. I think we poked a few. Well yeah, but I mean it's all been from other people's stuff. That's true. You know, I didn't do my own whole poking. No, we should probably say we'd never begrudge anybody that believing in something like that or enjoying like I don't think behind it or anything like that. Yes, you can go out dump all your stocks and sell your worldly possessions, or you cancel your big fashion debut. Yeah, that's all that just hurt you. Although that may have hurt the fashion world. Yeah, you probably had it the week after. You want to hear something crazy about the day before September eleven, this group called The Coup. They're a rap group out of Oakland. They're pretty awesome. They were releasing their album I can't remember what's called. I want to say, like party Time or party Fever, party something and um, like the day before they and it had the the guy Boots Riley, who is like the m C for the group. It had him like standing there pressing a button in the twin towers were coming down, like blowing up. They were going to release it like the day before. It was scheduled to release in September two thou one, and then nine eleven happened. They're like, well, let's change the cover. And that's why you've never heard of the coup I wonder Actually, yeah, well they were getting kind of big right around that time. The album had like good buzz around it, and then yeah, they just went away. They're still around them. Well, all the all the entertainment that was released around that time notoriously suffered. Yeah, um, I can't remember what movies in particular, but yeah, exactly, there are a lot of things later around the people are like, well, we've released it right before nine eleven, so we were you know, we were doomed, but it was a movie. Who cares, you know. So if you want to know more about in Nostro Damas, you can go look this up on how Still works dot com by skin in the search bar, or you can just kind of look around the internet because there is plenty of stuff about that dude on there, and enjoy yourself. And since I said enjoy yourself, it's time for listener. Now, I'm gonna call this um trailer builder. Um. Hey, guys, Chuck and Josh or Josh and Chuck, whichever you prefer. Prefer Josh and Chuck. I think he goes either way. Yeah, well that's what we kind of settled on, consistent branding. No, it goes both ways. We go both ways, all right, Chuck and Josh, Josh and Chuck. Hey, guys, I must admit that I tried very hard not to listen to you. I was told by several of my friends that I absolutely must subscribe to your show. However, is to stay at home dad by day to a beautiful three year old and three month old boys. Very busy small business owner by night had trouble finding enough time to go poop let alone indulge in any form of entertainment. Needless to say, I did listen and wonder and became instantly addicted. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed learning. The two months since I first gave you, guys a shot, had been on a steady binge and quickly running out of back episodes to listen to, which is a frightening prospect to me, considering podcast is a fuel that powers my motivation engine. While I work, my brother and I own and operate Oregon trailer. Uh, that's trail apostrophe are where the two of us built high end, tiny, tear drop style camp trailers. Have you ever seen those? Really cool? Like? I want one of these? Um, he's gonna send anyone. I found that while my hands are on autopilot building trailers, my brain has been totally neglected listening to my requisite Pandora stations. But now that I'm listening to you fellas and receiving constant brain stimulation, getting more done than ever and enjoying every second. Uh, my wife and sons thank you, as well as my general mood is improved despite the potentially unhealthy lack of sleep. However, my lovely wife is still getting a little tired of the phrase. So. I was listening to stuff you should know last night dot dot dot. So I just want to say thanks for everything you guys do, have done, and we'll do in the future. Large amounts of platonic love that is Sawyer Christensen and uh, I'm gonna plug Oregon trailer dot net just because these things are really cool. Yeah, Oregon trail apostrophe or no on on the website, it's trailer, Okay, Oregon trailer dot Net. Good point. And um, if you're in the market for one of those, like check them out small business handmade, send me one, send Josh one and i'd be sweet. Yeah, they're pretty neat. Thanks a lot, Syr Christensen, great name by the way, and uh, we appreciate the kudos.
