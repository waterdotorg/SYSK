Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. It's all right, cry crying, that's sad out all of you. It's all right, hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w Chuck Bryant. How are you doing good, sir? Are you doing good? Okay? Good? Um, you put the two of us together and you've got a little podcast called Stuff you Should Know, And that's what this is. And you get more than that. Even though, uh, this was an abnormal start, semi abnormal. We've had Devo kick us off before. Uh yeah, but hey, Divo has got nothing on Rosie Greer. No, you want to talk a little bit about well, yeah, obviously, uh, children of the seventies might recognize that song. Um might be very fond to some of you, like it is to Me from the awesome album Free to Be You and Me, which uh Marlo Thomas headed up this this record in the seventies to basically build kids up, make him feel better about you know, if you're a boy and you're a little effeminine, you like to play with dolls. So was the one called William Wants a Doll. If you're a boy and you know you wanted to cry, Rosie Greer's there to tell you it's okay. Ye might make you feel better. And uh there was you know, there was one about like treating your grandparents with respect, and it's okay for girls to like do boy things and boys to do girl things. And you know it's very seventies. It's okay for girls to punch in the arm. Yeah, pretty hard. I think there was a song about that. I love the seventies for that reason. It was great though. Man, I listened to this one like a lot. Yeah. Mel Books was on it, and and Bancroft, and I mean it was a litany of awesome seventies guests. So thank you, Marlo Thomas, and now thank you to Uncle Chuck for bringing it back. Josh, before we go any further, what are you doing? We have a very special announcement that I'd like you to make right now. You want me to make it, and we're doing it at the beginning of the show, because not everyone listens all the way through, even though they're missing out. Yeah, uh so, yeah, please announce this is a very high honor. As everyone knows, We're doing a live podcast at south By Southwest on Sunday, March eleven, from three thirty four thirty in the Maximilian Room at the Drisco Hotel. Right that for badge holders, it's been pretty clear the whole time, I hope. So we've been kind of dancing around what we're doing at this special event, this stuff you should know. Variety Show the next day, which is Monday, March twelve, from five to nine at Fidoux Irish Pub on Fourth Street in Austin. Dance no more, sir, No, I hand the dance card over to you. Chuck do it, uh, dudes and do debts. We have been lucky enough to get a chance at television with a TV pilot for Science Channel. The awesome, awesome people at Science Channel have given us a chance for a half hour TV pilot. We made it. It's in the can. Yeah, like we'd gone over where in the second round of editing. We're just all together. It's happening. This pilot is coming together. It is coming together, and uh. That will be the basis of the Variety Show, featuring an appearance by Mr John Hodgman. How could we not include Hodgy? He's always there. Eugene Merman, who I'm looking forward to meeting, very funny comedian big Man. His music by Lucy waynewright Roach, who is in the pilot to play Jerry Crazy and Jerry will be there too, and we're gonna put him right next to one another. Remember it's been the plan all along, our buddies Henry Clay, people who have been friends for a few years now. It's crazy and who you manage on the side, manage and the side sometimes. Uh, they did the score, Joey when the band did the score and the theme song, did a lot of composing, did some good stuff. Yeah, and they will be playing this this party and local Austin band Crooks, who it turns out are also fans of the show. And that just happened. Yeah, I like it when serendip happens to So Crooks are gonna be playing as well. And they're they're awesome, sort of old school country with a little new school rock thrown in. And uh, we will be showing clips from the show throughout the night, which we think, I mean, we've seen this show how many times? Chuck and I still like it. I feel like this is a pretty neat pilot. So if you want to be in the know and get a sneak peek this thing and whatever I said on Facebook today, whatever you think this show was like, you're wrong. Oh wow, you've been You've been taunting people. I just I don't think anyone is gonna expect what we're gonna give him. Okay, well it's gonna air at some point right to yeah, the spring, but this is the debut, the premiere of the sneak peak clips of the Stuff You Should Know TV pilot. That's right, Monday, March twelve from five to nine Fidoe Irish Pub to fourteen West fourth Street, Austin, Texas. Free drink ticket to the first one guests. Yes, I mean that's really You don't have to like leg wrestle to find out who uses it. So wow, yeah that is that is reason up the coach. And this is not for badge holders, Nope, this is for the public at large and it's anybody can come free. It's totally totals free. Well we're not buying drinks or anything, but it's it's still like there's no admission. Uh, no admission whatsoever. I don't even think there's an age requirement. I believe they serve food. It's like just a restaurant as well, so you don't have to get all drinking. You can just come and sip on some iced tea. Excellent. So is that it? Can we get back to the show now? All right? Back to the show we recorded several weeks back. Okay, Wow, the focus obviously on this one is crying. If you notice the title, that shouldn't come as much of a surprise. UM, I have a little story for you. Um have you heard of the movie Water for Elephants? Uh? Yeah, it's like Reese Witherspoon and the dude from Twilight. Yeah. Emily saw that. Is it any good? She enjoyed it? Well. I was researching whether or not elephants can cry, and apparently at one of the premiers, I think the premiere in Australia for this movie, the elephant costar was there and it started crying really and apparently everybody was really affected by this elephant just crying in you know, the middle of public. Didn't think the Australians, We're going to eat them. I don't know what the elephant was thinking, And we're not even certain whether the elephant was crying, because as far as we can tell, humans are the only species that cry emotionally as the result of an emotion. Yes, but it is possible that elephants and guerrillas are the two like as candidates as it stands now do as well. But we're so far from understanding whether elephants do that. We don't even know how often humans cry, let alone whether elephants can cry for an emotion. Yeah, there's been a lot more studies done on laughter and its benefits than crying. I found out. Yeah, I've noticed, Chuck, we've been doing this what for coming up on twenty years, four years, we're coming up onto our fourth year eventually this year. UM And I found like, when we encounter stuff like this fields topics that haven't fully been sussed out, there's two ways it can go. It's either loaded with total bs hypotheses that like maybe makes sense in a really eight year old common sense way UM or are just filled with awesome like um ideas of just basically our demonstrations of how great humanity can use its mind. Right, this is the former, and I'm sorry for tapping on the table. I know that that's a new habit of mine, and then it screws things up, but it's it's for emphasis. Yeah. Uh. As far as the gorilla thing, I can direct people if you want to cry to the video of Cocoa the gorilla sign language gorilla. Yeah. She uh. She had a pet kitten at one point, and it's very cute and you see this kitten and Cocoa bonding and it's those videos are the best. Anyway, she accidentally breaks its has to shoot her in the back of the head. No, no, Gary Sinise. Actually I think it was a chokehold. Um. But the cat of course gets out and gets hit by a car and killed. And they have on tape the the woman going and telling Cocoa that the kitten is dead, and Coco I might start crying right now. Coco starts making the signs for bad and sad and frown and then cry and like, dude, you gotta see it. I mean, I'm a weepy guy anyway, but I was at my desk earlier just like fighting it back. But then I really encourage you to go look at the video. Right after that, Cocoa gets a new kitten. Oh yeah, that'll just make you feel better all over again. Okay, I'm glad. Is it in like the replace screen? It's one of the ones that pops up. Is the next thing. It actually has a pop up while you're watching this, like click on here to see Cocoa get a new kitten. But yeah, I mean it looks like Cocoa is very much emotional. Whether or not Coco is actually crying, and whether or not animals get emotional is under debate, and that's a whole other topic in itself. Um, but I guess the point is is we're we're only kind of beginning to get a loose grasp on why we cry and how we cry, and so the research is kind of um uh insufficient, I guess. But we're just gonna go through some of the ideas of what's behind crying. We have something of a good grasp on the physiology of it. Yeah. And this whole thing, this guy that that surmised about our ancestors, Yeah, this one that was so weak. This is BS hypothesis number one. Do you want to take? Yeah. Dr Paul D. McClean theorized that our you know, cave ancestors would um, cremate the deceased become overcome by emotions, and then the smoke would get in their eyes, which would trigger reflex tears, which we'll talk about. And um, then all of a sudden they were just linked forever and crying or death and mourning and crying, which and that was the birth of emotional tears. I don't buy that one, any of I don't either, but it does lead us pretty uh pretty uh segway into what emotional tears are. Right there. One of three types of tears that we've sussed out, um, the first being basil tears, which with or without cocoa you've got right now. We cry every day. Tend it what five to announces? Yeah, that's a lot. Yeah, and you were you aware of that? Well, I didn't know it was that much. It's almost a bottle of beer. Yeah, it's a good point. Yeah, that makes me want to cry. I don't know why. Um yeah, I mean obviously your eyes would dry out, So that's just your body's uh taking care of itself by by working up these tears. And most of that, UM, well, I guess just about all of the five to ten ounces of basal tears, uh, that you produce every day. Drain through your sinuses, your scinus cavity instead of streaming down your cheeks, which you might get stopped up. They sit and here a running nose when you cry. But I get stopped up personally, do you, yeah, like stops up my sinuses, um, my nose ruins generally? Really? Yeah? Um? Well, what are tears? I don't think we even said that. Oh, tears are liquid e secretions of fats, proteins, mucus oil, but for the most part water um. And depending on the type of tears, this is very significant. Though, depending on the type of tears, the composition is going to be different. So if you look at, um, say, reflex tears, which are designed to um rid your eye of some sort of irritant, right smoke? Onions? Onions? Do you want to tell everybody how onions work? Yeah? I feel like it's time that we finally explained that one not step off the list. Uh. There's an enzyme called lachrymatory factor synthas and that is released when you cut into the onion, and then that converts amino acids to sol phenic acid, and then that sulfenic acid turns into uh, sin roepan, the theol s oxide, and that is what irritates your lacrymal glands to cry when you cut an onion. Right, and mine, really, I think I mentioned this before. Mine really go hey, whire burns. It's it's pretty bad. So I got Emily got me those little goggles everywhere. Can you post a picture of you cutting onions wearing goggles? I can't. Actually, I'd like we'll not cutting onions. But I tried them on on Christmas Day when she got them, same effect. But I'm saying the next time that you cut onions wearing these goggles, I'd like to see that. Um So, yeah, you you also mentioned another important point, the lacrimal gland. It's in the upper outer region of your eye, and this is where tears are produced. That um so, you've got basil tears, you've got reflex tears, and then you have the emotional tears. The great grand mystery of humanity and why we cry? Right right? Um so with with emotional tears. Uh. From what we can it is a great picture of you wearing goggle. That's really great. They work too. Um you look like wow, that's a great I gotta stop right there. Um. But so with emotional tears, what we suspect is going on is that the cerebrum, which registers sadness, um says, hey eyes, uh you know, says hey, endocrine system, you're feeling a little blue. Why don't you go activate the lacrymal glands and let's get the crying commenced, release the hormones. Yeah, um, and uh, I don't think it's any coincidence that you that you expressed tears at the same time you're expressing emotion, right, I would agree with that. And that's what you were kind of talking about earlier, the whole theory of whether or not having a good cry it makes you feel better. And you mentioned earlier that the composition of the tears dippers and they collected let's just call them onion tears for lack of a better well, we have reflex hears. They collected onion tears, and they collected sad movie tears. And uh, I found that the reflex onion tears were what like ninety eight percent water, whereas the other ones were chuck full of sad proteins like prolactin, which is very much involved in the process of um producing breast milk, hence the name. It's for lactating pro lactin. What else are you gonna say that other one? Yes, I am chuck. It's UH. Adreno corta co tropic hormones. Adrenal corte tropic hormones to UM indicate high levels of stress. So that makes sense, which is a commonly experienced thing while you're crying. And then there's lucine and fallen episodes have just turned into like this parade of me humiliating myself. Now you did well. Lucine and cafollen, which is an endorphment that reduces pain and improves moon. Yeah, so that it makes sense that you would find these in tears when you might not in emotional tears instead of reflex tears. The problem is is that not all UM studies who have looked into this, that have looked into this have found that crying does make you feel better. There's been plenty of studies that have found the opposite. Most studies, I shouldn't say most, but some studies have found UH that there's no change whatsoever. People don't feel any better or worse. And one study that required UM I think like like twelve hundred. No, there were like twelve hundred account of crying over like seventy days among like x number of UM female college students. UM it found that that crying was preceded by two days of low mood and proceeded by two days of low mood. So on either side of a crying incident, there was two bad days before and after, so there wasn't necessarily an improved mood. Well, and one of the studies that you have sent me earlier kind of gave some reason behind this, which makes sense to me. UM. One reason might be because laboratory crying you may not be getting consolation, which might be what makes you feel better when someone sees you crying they came over to patch on the back and you know, buck up, camper. And the other was that it's not a realistic study. Oh well, the the helplessness factor, which made a lot of sense to me, Like you're watching the Sarah McLaughlin uh animals dying thing and a good cry when that doesn't make you feeling better because animals are still dying. So there's this helplessness like when you're watching the sad movie that like I can't these characters. So a good cry, is it gonna make me feel any better? No, but it may in a real world setting where you're crying and it's cathartic and somebody's making you feel better and then also explaining to you how things actually are better, and you're like right. So it's kind of a tough nut to crack because when you study something like this, they sit you down in a lab and make you watch Brian's Song and you know, I've never seen it. It's a little clinical. Brian's song is Brian looks very sad? Isn't that John Voight? Now it was Jimmy Cohn And uh, I can't remember who played Gayl Sayers, but um, yeah, it was the famous story of the football player dying of cancer, Gayl Sayers teammate very sad, you know, speaking of sad and dying. Um, there's a whole I wish I would have looked it up ahead of time. I read an article about people who love these books but you know, like Sweet Valley High. Imagine if each book was about a different Sweet Valley High girl and they were all dying young, but they were like the brave, like captain of the cheerleading squads, a student class president, don't ever feel bad for me kind of gals. But they always died at the end. And there's like this series of like fifty books of like young adult fiction that's by this one author and it's all like dying young. I wonder if the purpose of those was too, you know, prepare kids for losing friends young, because that does happen ladies, where they're dying all over the place. Was it a female author? You know, yes, I'm interesting. I don't remember that. I'm sure somebody will, right, and please do um So Japan you want to mention that. Yeah, I even look this up to verify because it sounds a little wacky. But you know, the Japanese, they're always setting the standard for things like this. They have crying clubs over there where they do believe that it makes you feel better, so they'll get together as a group and watch these sad movies or having read these books and talk about them just to have a group cry. But you also, you just hit something on the head. And importently is that they believe that crying makes you feel better. Apparently it's culturally bound. So yeah, if you're in a if you live in a society that doesn't think crying makes you feel better. Maybe you're kind of a whisp for crying. You're less likely to report feeling better after crying than somebody who lives in a society like Japan where it's supported, yes, that makes sense, or where people think that crying does make you feel better. It's like zombies and I cry a lot. I'm a very weepy guy. I know you are, and I think it said one reason, Uh, we'll go ahead and give away a secret. One reason they think men might cry less because they sweat more. And if crying is a way to release some of these build up of toxins, then sweat would do that. But I sweat bs hypothesis, I could cry. I've got an overactive bladder. I know. I've seen you cry, sweat, and pe all at the same time. Dude, I'm just constantly leaking fluids. I know it doesn't help, believe me, because there's always some kind of fluid right behind it, and there's always another Coco video coming up. I've I'm very eye rolly as a result. Oh yeah, thank you for that. Um So what else we have? Well, let's talk about babies. When we start crying, obviously is when we're a little uh crying newborns, which makes sense. I mean, you cry, you need help, you want to be changed, You're totally you're you're helpless, useless, there's nothing you can do, so you cry. I'm hungry at everybody. Now, I'm sleepy, sleepy. I was looking into this, chuck like that still doesn't quite make sense. Why babies cry. I mean, we take it for for you know, granted, it's just babies cry, it's what they do. But when did the first human baby cry? And why did the first human baby cry? And I looked into it and there was actually this cool study that put up a few hypotheses that aren't necessarily be us. They're the very least, very interesting of why humans started to cry. And it's like based on natural selection, like the first few babies that cried were selected one because it reduces infanicide, okay, which is apparently very common in early early cultures. It reduces yes, and here's why. It emotionally manipulates the parent into not just abandoning the baby or leaving the baby melicicits sympathy, yes, but it also um basically says, Hey, I'm a very healthy, fit baby. You don't want to leave me behind. I'm gonna be great at picking berries when yes, exactly. Now, if if I were the type of baby just abandoned and leave for dead, I may just not even be able to get a good cry going. So it makes sense a little whimpering cry might not be as strong, exactly. So it was that led to natural selection of crying in babies, and that's why we cry today. At least, that's that makes sense. That's one of the better hypotheses I've run across. I was just thinking my own hypothesis might be that, you know, back then, it's not like the mother was always right over the baby like they are today. No, that's not you. The opposite is true. Oh really, there were more present. They carried him everywhere. Well, then there goes my hypothesis. It's okay, we I thought they had just part of science. Okay, no, no, I know what you're saying. And actually that kind of coincides with the reason why you would cry, because a baby that cries is being abandoned and knows it. Right when you're away from the mother for a very long time. That means Mom's gone. She's like twenty clicks that way and not coming back right. That's very sad. Reduces infanticide. So babies cry differently as they grow, to communicate different things in a in a in tune. Parent will tell you that, like from the other room of that cry probably means she needs to be changed. That cry means he's hungry or has fallen out of his crib and he's playing with power tools maybe you know. Uh, and then uh at ten months they think that's when babies start to cry to manipulate their parents for attention. And this, by the way, I thought it was a very sexist article. Did you notice some of the lines, oh, man, like, yeah, and that's when your mascara runs. If the guy had written this, could you imagine the backlash? No, I totally can. I picked up on that as well. I know what you're about to say. I couldn't even bring myself to underline and I just ignored it completely. Well, I highlighted it in green because I wanted to read it. Here's what the line is. Some studies have reported that women in particular continue this manipulative crying throughout their life in order to manipulate others into giving them what they want, for example, forgiveness, pity, or a diamond bracelet. I mean, I don't know. It is very I'm even offended. I was too. I read that to Emily. She's like, are you kidding me? The author is in trouble. Maybe she is. Um. So you've got manipulative crying at about the age of ten months, right, But there is manipulative crying as adults. I'm not trying to say there's not, because there definitely is. I think done it as a man. No, for what, what did you want when you're young and emotional and that your girlfriend breaks up with you and you just want you just want her back, man, you just want her back and maybe if you seem sad enough, she'll feel sorry for you and take you back. So you weren't sad, uh, yeah, if you weren't sad enough to cry naturally, But I'm still working at the crocodile tears just to uh. Crocodiles only try to excrete excess salt water. Well, that's why they call them crocodile tiers, because there's nothing a motive behind it, all right, moving on to adolescence, Well, not quite yet. The adolescence. Uh, we should say that up to adolescents. From the time that we're infants to adolescence, boys and girls supposedly cry at about the same frequency and amount, at least same frequency. There's not a lot of um change or difference between the gender. But when we do hit adolescents, and this one makes a lot of sense, um voice, testosterone shoots up, and there's a negative correlation with crying. It decreases. They can just get angry with girls. They're crying actually increases. And there's a positive correlation with estrogen production. Um, which that sounds kind of sexist, but it's true physiologically speaking, it's true, right, Um. And in conjunction with estrogen production, you've also got prolactin, which, don't forget, is found in emotional tears. And a crying researcher named is it William Fry William Fry and Muriel trying the Mystery of tears? Okay, he Fry, I believe actually in Alzheimer's researcher and he just did like crying as a as an amusement. Yeah, he's one of those, um. But he uh, he suggests that girls have about six more prolactin in their bodies at any given time than men. Um and as a result, they tend to cry more and more frequently. Um four times as much as what he says, Yeah, which is a lot. But again, no one's really done a great, big, huge survey on how often people cry. Yeah, this one, I don't know how large it was, but it was a study, um the head people record how many times they cried over the period of one year. This one found women cried roughly sixty four times compared to seventeen and men and everyone underestimated men and women how much they would have cried. But um, that seems low to me, or maybe I'm just speaking personally as a weepy guy, you know, it's like seventeen. I was like, I think sixty four is low. Oh yeah, I mean I'll cry. And and something I didn't see in here was crying over some over beauty. That happens to me a lot too, or something that's just so beautiful at a concert or a sunrise or something. We look at that guy's light. Yeah, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It is what do you mean it a concert? Well, like the music or something like. I saw the the Oh De Joy at Carnegie Hall one time. When that kicked in, I was so like overwrought I started crying. I um, I just I thought Bonnie Prince Billy concert. Not No, I would cry at a Bonny Prince Billy concert with the music moved me enough. Um I I want to say, on behalf of everybody, thank you for sharing so much of yourself in this one. It's making the whole thing way better. I don't mind. I mean, who cares, No, it certainly doesn't. Rosie Greer says, so. Um. So let's see men also here we arrive at BS hypothesis three. Okay, men cry less chuck because they supposedly have smaller tear ducks or lacrymal glance. Cry fewer tears, no less volume volume because women have larger Okay, well you think that's BS totally Yeah, yeah, well maybe women are equipped with larger ones because they cry more. You think maybe most of the hyper season research I'm crying. It's done in the back of cocktail napkins for some reason. According to Women's Health Magazine, though Josh, men typically only cry when they suffer a major loss and I find this to be true for a lot of guys. Is usually it's anger and frustration. Uh, or anger is how they express frustration and stress, whereas a woman might be more prone to cry if they're frustrated or stressed. Yeah, that's probably been true for me, and I'm a weepy guy. I think though, that it's a difference in threshold. Sure, possibly because I think frustration and anger can lead to tears pretty pretty frequently when you reach that point. Yeah, I think it's it's just a difference in threshold. There's a lower threshold perhaps in women, maybe not. I don't know what I'm saying, like that would be my take on that. Or maybe men maybe the the stereotypical his street of men not being allowed to cry, or it's just a sign of weakness. Maybe that leads to even more frustration, so it's expressed his anger. Which is funny because there is a study that's mentioned in this article that, um, they did a survey of people saying, you know, uh, does men crying bother you? And do you think it bothers other people? And most people were like, it doesn't really bother me, but yeah, I'm sure it bothers everybody else, and like virtually everybody responded that way. So in other words, people don't mind, they're just not talking about it. Well, it's just like this this social ideal or societal ideal that men shouldn't cry, and other people are bothered by it, even though no one's really bothered by it. Thanks to Rosie Greer, it's called the Greer effect. He was a football player too. I don't know if I mentioned that. Cool dude. He was also in uh, The Thing with Two Heads, The Thing with Two Heads, The Man with two Brains. He and oh man, it wasn't like I don't think it was. It may have been William Holden. It was a a rich um scientist who had his head attached to a convict name played by Rosy Greer's body, and they were like this odd couple. It was like a creature feature Saturday shocker type. Never heard of the seventies The Thing with Two Heads is think is what it's called. Great movie. Trying to get that immediately that in The Incredible Melting Man. I never heard of that one. That was a good one. Was that because of a at the ice age. I remember, that was my hypothesis. You have a good memory. All right, Well there's our tangent for this episode. Um. Getting back to men crying, though, they have done some research and some people think that a note noted man crying in public is actually good for your career and good for your pr like John Bayner. Sure, Tim Tebow. Now, do you remember when I think Florida lost the Tennessee and Tebow cried? It was there was some guy who's like, oh, Tebow, your tears taste so sweet. It was beautiful to see. Yeah, I don't. I don't dislike him as much now though, because of uh, I'm not like some big fan. But I found that once a player leaves or coach leaves the University of Florida, like I love Coach Spurrier, you're you disgusted me for even saying that. Now, once they leave Florida, I don't have that time to keep that to yourself. I've found that that's not the case with me. Like I hate Spurrier, still, I can't stand Tebow Urban Meyer like everybody, I can't stand anybody who has Florida stank on him. Rex Grossman, I don't care who you're talking about that. I I can't stand any of them. Well, you know, I like that kind of consistency. I just got so angry accidentally licked the mic cover. That's grass. Um. What else have we got here? Oh? Well, why why we cry? Um? There's again the fields wide open for any quack to come up with an idea and get it published in an article on how stuff works keeps us healthier? Yeah, by removing toxins stress related hormones. But but your pooh, pooh, But do you remember when we did how saunas work, and we're talking about how, yes, you have um kidneys and you're bladder and your euretha euretha. To get rid of all these toxins, you don't really need to sweat, but sweating does get rid of some of it, and every little bit helps conceivably, Well, these stress related hormones do exit your body through your tears. And I think it's beyond just the toxins. I think that I believe that holding onto the these negative emotions is not good ultimately for for your heart and your body. I think, you know, I think a good cry could help. I've seen it, and you've experienced. I've experienced, you've seen it. Don't back off now, yeah, you're right. Um, people from colitis and ulcers tend to have a poor view of crying. Uh, then people who don't have that, which apparently suggests that if you don't cry, you're gonna end up with ulcers in colitis. I don't know about that one, that's true. You gave me something interesting on depression. Uh. They studied forty four people with mood disorders. I guess the forty person just they couldn't show up, you know. Uh, And they said that they were in fact more prone to crying than than people who they were comparing them to who didn't have the mood disorder. But if you had severe depression, a lot of times you had an inability to cry altogether, which is really sad to me. Yes, that's very sad. I guess it's just that dead inside feeling that's awful. Um. There's also symptoms of crying excessively apparently some people with PTSD, right. Uh. One of the symptoms is excessive crying postpartum. Yeah, postponton depression, which I didn't know this. Nine of women suffered from postpartum depression following birth. What do you think it was? Lower? Yeah? Really, I didn't realize it was that prevalent. Yeah, I did, and I guess it would have to follow birth to be postpartum depression. That was redundant. Uh. In this interesting study in Israel, they had men sniff sailing solution compared to real human tears, and that they found that when they smelled the real tears or testosterone dipped and brain scan showed less activity in areas associated with sexual arousal. So that made good sense to me because if someone if someone's really upset and crying, it's not sexually stimulating to to you, unless unless you're you're real sick person. So I would say it it's its sympathy and lowers your sexy time feelings, which which kind of um gives it a which kind of supports the idea that like a social bonding theory of crying. Yeah, you know, you're signaling to somebody else that you're not aggressive, you're you're you're submitting, you're you're allowing yourself to be vulnerable. So he just lay off of you, hold me, don't hit me. Yeah, put the rock down. Did you ever see the doctor cats about the man hugs. I've seen all of them, but I don't remember that. There was one bit where he was talking about the man hugs. When the man hug and they slap. He was like, men have to do that because I'm holding you, but i'm hitting you. Right, yeah, yeah, I do remember that, right, doctor kats so good? You got anything else? Um? And you know I'll post that photo of me with the goggles always forget, but someone Cooper will remind me. Then he'll turn it into something sick and twisted. Right, Well, I was crying.

I'm gonna call this from Lori in Germany. Like Germany, guys, Uh, you recently saved my butt and I thought it would write in to tell you about it. I'm an Atlanta girl. Originally, he was currently teaching English at a kindergarten in Germany. Don't I mean garden of children? I think so. Uh. In the last week before Christmas, I showed my kids a Muppet Christmas Carol, one of the best Christmas movies ever. If he asked me, and as I'm sure you know, there was. There are several ghosts in the story, but since it's a kids movie, I assumed it would not be too scary for my wee laws. Well. I showed the first half on Monday, and then I was out sick for a couple of days. When I came back on Thursday, I learned that one of my little girls, six year old Anka, had barely slept since she had seen the movie. Apparently the ghosts were too scary for her, and her mother was apparently stink sala, which is an excellent German word meaning stinking angry, so she was stink salau. In an effort to run damage control, I showed Anka and a couple of other kids the pictures from the Muppets article on how stuff works dot com the diagrams uh and this this was a really great article as far as that stuff goes. The visuals the diagrams showing how the muppeteers control the various types of muppets were a really interesting to both me and the kids and be a miracle cure for Anica's spears. That cool little behind the scenes tour help meet my wiwas It's a little disconcerting, isn't it. No, you help my weas appreciate the cool design of the ghosts instead of being afraid of them, and Anica's mom was no longer stink salaz hazah to that.
