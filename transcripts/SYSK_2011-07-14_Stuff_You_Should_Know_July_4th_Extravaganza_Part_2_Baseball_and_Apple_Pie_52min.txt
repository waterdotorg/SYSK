Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, we're back. I guess you could say it's a part two of two. This is the second concluding part of our two part series on America, the part of the July. You gotta say hey and welcome to the podcast because this is uh the beginning of part two. Yeah, but we're technically in the middle. All right, Hey, and welcome to the podcast. Thank you? You feel better? All right? So this is uh picking up where we left off. We still don't know where we cut off, so our guess is as good as yours and vice versa. Awesome. This is stuff you should know about America from the serious X Time studios in New York City. Now more it's from Josh and Shucks actually doing Thank you Jay, Thank you Jill. That was as great as I hoped it would be. Joe Angel something when he told me he's like, we're gonna need another mic in a v I P seat because I got someone doing footnotes, like what what does that mean? And now I know? And knowing is half the battle. That's what I do. So chuck. Um, I don't think we could do a July four show reasonably and not talk about fireworks, right, It'd be a big rip off. I mean, I don't think there's any better way to enjoy a fireworks display than to know the chemistry that's going behind it, right. I feel like you take that that kind of understand well, whether you like it or not, we're going to teach you this right now, right. Yeah, man, you're the expert on this, but I do like, well, I'll chime in. Go ahead, it's gonna be like I like the name of the Chinese manual. Well, you take the name of the Chinese manual first. Let me set you up, okay, um? So, uh, fireworks are based on black powder, which has been around since at least ten forty four. Uh, and it was discovered in China, right, Um. It was either the result of some alchemists who are looking for a way to preserve youth or a hapless chef who accidentally discovered it. Can I stop you there, because I've the first one doesn't make any sense to me. The second one does, I get it. Chinese chef making bananas foster or something. Boom and all of a sudden, there's there's gunpowder. But how does gunpowder figure into trying to make yourself look younger? Is what I wanted. I don't know. I have no answer for that. I charcoal, I guess, potassium nitrate, which is saltpeter, and then the sulfur. I think if you applied those things separately to your face and then wash them off well enough and just don't light it right, well, if you know, if you got too close to a fire, then ka boom okay, yeah, all right, well that makes sense now, but those are the three ingredients in black powder, right, that's right? And uh, I wanted to point out the Chinese. Uh, we know it has been around since ten forty four because it was in the Collection of the most Important Military Techniques. That's what they called their book. It is a good book name, pretty straightforward. So um, however they discovered it um Now, I don't know if they understood what was going on back then. Now we have a pretty good understanding of what's going on with black powder. Right. So you've got um, potassium nitrate, which is saltpeter, which is um an oxidizer. Right, Yeah, that's like the mix is charcoal, which is fuel, and then you've got sulfur, which is a reducing agent, and that's the last ten percent, that's right. So you mix them all together, you introduce flame, which ignites it, and all of a sudden, the potassium nitrate starts releasing all this oxygen which feeds the charcoal a right, binds to it and creates the light and the heat that you see in fireworks. Right boom, Right, we're almost there, um. And then you have the oxygen from the potassium nitrate also re acting with the sulfur to create this explosive force. As c O two and nitrate, nitrogen are produced and they expand and that's the boom right yeah, okay, and okay, you just hit it earlier to get a point. So you've got the sulfur and the oxygen binding together, creating C O two and nitrogen and that's where you get the explosive force. Boom, Thank you, it was good. You wouldn't think it'd be that hard. Um. And that's that's the basis of um fireworks, right, Yeah, that's the basis of the firecracker. And so now we move on to sparklers, which is pretty much the same thing it pretty much is. But what you do with the sparkler is you have that black powder, add a little sugar, add a little water, and you get something called you know, sort of like a slurry. You dip your stick into it, as it were, and uh metal stick. And because everything's spread out, it's not gonna be like as volatile and create a big flash bang boom, it's over. It's spread out because it's mixed with a slurry. And you add a little uh whatton metal to that, like some sort of metal dust or shavings, and then that heats up and jumps off and becomes incandescent. And there's a sparkler. What's the noise for that sparkler? Okay, there we go. There's just sparkling. And the reason this is important is because when you go out on the fourth of July wherever you do that here in New York, imagine there everywhere and you see the big pyrotechnic display, it is really just versions of sparklers and firecrackers, right. The sparkler and the firecracker the basis of all other fireworks. Right, that's right. So these aerial displays, it's just a shell which is like a ball filled with black powder and then little pellets of um sparkler composition that they call stars, right, And in the middle of that is a firecracker, and you use a lifting charge to send it into the air, and the lifting charge ignites the fuse nice and then when it when it hits a certain altitude and that that fuse goes off and the firecracker in the middle blows up. It ignites the black powder. Right. So there's your explosion, and that in turn sends the pellets the stars scattered lights them and there's your firework. That's it, as you say about it being bot a boom bon Jovi fireworks. Let's say that. And you can get fancy with it if you want to cobble these together. You cobble the shells together, add something called a breaking charge, and that is when you see like the one shell explode and then that breaking charge sets off the other ones. And that's where you get the cool little things that everyone ooze and oz at. Right. And then you add some chemical salts for color. That's right, like, uh, what do we have blue for copper? Blue is copper, Stronium is red, and then stronium and copper make purple. Wow, look at you. I got sodium for yellow, calcium for orange, aluminium for my British friends, uh is silver and bare m is green. Pretty neat, right. So now when you're watching the fireworks display, you can curse us because you're sitting there thinking about the sulfur is a reducing agent? What's that smell? Oh, that's the reducing agent. Just give me a beard and shut up exactly. So that's a that's a fireworks, right. But but that's just like fireworks when they go right, that's that's the optimum of what can happen with firework what we just said, right, But we live in La la land in a lot of ways, and fireworks don't always go well right. So um, we have our friend Hallie heglind here to talk to us about, um when fireworks don't go so well. Right, that's right. Hally apparently has a pretty true story for us. So everybody welcome Holly. All right, let's see that's right. I was good? Is this good? Should I lower this? Or I don't even know who I'm talking You can probably you can write angle it down. Okay, this is the highlight of the show. Yeah, never let it be said that, Um, Josh and Chuck, don't teach the controversy, because that's why I'm here. Um, alright, Well, I have some facts and figures in my presentation, so I may need to refer to my notes. Um. But I'm sure that you've all seen the public service videos that local news stations roll out around this time of year. You know, there's like a fake adorable child posed in a field of grass and uh, you know, obviously celebrating something because they're wearing something really nice from the local J C. Pennies. Um. And uh, you know it's a mannequin that's completely faceless, um, and yet human like because they put a straw sun sun hat on the head to remind you, like, be careful, this fake child is sensitive to the sun. So you know, so that so that, so the mannequin is posed in like some position of youthful curiosity, and all of a sudden boom, you know, a Roman candle blows its head off, and in the blink of an eye there's nothing but like a cloud of smoke and lime dust and a sin straw hat two feet away in the grass. So um, this is uh what we all see every day. You know the hazards of fireworks, and if it's if it's a low budget sort of news station, they actually just blow up a watermelon. But either way they teach you the havoc that fireworks can wreak upon our nation's children or our nation's fruit. Yeah. So if you don't think fireworks are dangerous, can I ask you a question? Okay, since how many fireworks fact stories do you think have burned down? According to my not very thorough research, it's up five okay, so Denmark, Holland, the UK, England, and the Philippines. So here let me get my numbers. If you don't think they're dangerous, just ask the one one thousand, two hundred and fifty people in n Shade, Holland left homeless after nine ms, which I did the math. It's one thousand, nine hundred and eighty pounds of fireworks were accidentally detonated at their local factory. Or talked to the people of Cavite in the Philippines who felt the ground shake nearly two miles away from the explosion when a demonstration at their local firecracker factory went wrong. Or the two thousand people evacuated from ceased to Denmark, when factory workers accidentally dropped a container of fireworks somehow called using it to ignite. I watched a lot of internet videos in my research, and I will say, if you have to witness a human tragedy firsthand, um, a fireworks factory exploding is definitely the coolest you are going to come by. I mean, it's like cooler than the Disney World fireworks display. I'd say, yeah, Um, did you know that while celebrating Chinese New Year in two thousand nine, it only took one stray firecracker to burn down Beijing's thirties story luxury Mandarin Hotel. Now, to be fair, the Chinese are unincredibly efficient people, so what took them one firework would probably take us like reliefs of box okay um. In the United States, in two thousand ten, the Consumer Products Safety Commission reported three firework related desk deaths, which is up fifty percent from two. That was in nine, when only two firework related deaths were reported. And I don't expect the trend to turn around, because, let's face it, the economy is going to hell this Fourth of July. Americans are gonna want nothing more than to just throw back a six pack and just sparkler the world away. Okay, Okay, So maybe the cold hard statistics don't touch you. Maybe something more anecdote will get through to you. So I have witnessed the brutality of the firework firsthand. Let me take you back to Denver, Colorado, five of July. I am about to turn ten and my older brother Eric is fourteen. And you should know in Denver there is about a week right around the fourth of July where summer drought and a child stockpile of fireworks both simultaneously reach their peak. Um, so we have really hoarded this incredible stash. I mean we had every kind of fire work. We had snaps, we had sparklers, we had bottle rockets, we had Roman candles, we had tanks, we had snakes, we had bird cages, and of course we had smoke bombs. So um, we had sort of burned through most of our reserves. On the driveway the night before. My father has all these pictures that he took of us at night, and we're like crouch next to the garage door, and I'm wearing this Mexican pueble address that my mom bought for me. In Portavayarta, and my brother's wearing his hot pink jams, and you can see we're just sort of mesmerized by this black cat screech and scream fountain that we've just ignited. And uh, you know, there's like a deadness in my eyes and something about how I never brushed my hair that I'm really like spot on for Drew Barrymore and the fire starter posters, and um, my brother just keeps begging, like just one more, just one more, like like he's going to go into withdrawal if we stopped lighting fireworks. So what I'm saying is I feel like, looking at this picture, you could tell we were already struggling with some pretty serious demons. The next day, I was in a fog all day, you know, despite a full night of sleep. I was exhausted after our explosives bender, and so, uh, sometime in the afternoon, I went to the basement to find a cool place, and I was watching a current affair if you guys remember that, and I I must have drifted off because I remember I was awakened by a sound of sirens. Now my brother, I didn't know this at the time, was upstairs with three other boys from our block on the street, and they were playing this game that we played in our neighborhood all the time. I really hope no children are listening to this, and if you are, this is really bad game, so don't play this game. I was sort of um, you know. It was a spinoff of ding on Ditchum. So one person would go stand on the porch um poised to ring the doorbell, while another person would stand in the street with a smoke bomb. So as soon as the smoke bomb was lit in the street, the person on the porch would ring the doorbell and then run away and the person in the street would throw the smoke bomb. So ideally, your neighbor opens their door to a cloud of smoke and they think like a wizard just rung the door, and then they got really shy or something. But let me remind you again that Denver was a tinder box at that time of year, so my brother and his friends probably should have skipped the house across the street, the four Stads House, which was flanked by these two huge juniper trees. Uh actually historic trees. We later found out they were planted by the then governor Roy Romer's father in law, and about fifty years fire, and every so often the roamers would pile in their car and just drive through the neighborhood to check out how their trees were doing, because that's really what people in Colorado do for fun, They go and check out trees that they planted a long time ago. So it was actually my brother who threw the offending smoke bomb, and the smoke bomb was blue, so he he lit it and he aimed at the porch, but his aim was off and so instead of landing on the porch, it landed in the juniper tree on the right, and everyone just sort of sat there, stunned as the smoke billowing from the tree turned from blue to light blue to gray, and then you just heard this crackling sound. And it didn't take long for the fire for the fire in one tree to spread to the adjacent tree, and then to the roof of the four Stats house, and then to the roof of the neighbors of the four Stats House, and they just sort of stood there stunt like, how could this game have possibly gone back? And my mom, actually I was talking to this morning, and she reminded me of the fact that she at some point had come out onto the porch and when she saw fire, and she just saw the kids frozen in the street, and and they just looked her and they we don't know what to do. We don't know what to do. But then instead of running to my house, they ran to one of the other boys houses because the mom was way nicer, and they hid in the bathroom while the mom called the fire department. So, you know, after all there were there were the two trees were totally destroyed, and there was serious damage to two roofs, and also the four stops car which had been marked in the driveway. So that night, um everyone assembled for sort of a disciplinary meeting on our side porch would have, which happened to offer a prime view of the charred, scorched earth across the street. And uh, you know, it was all the boys and all the parents, and I sort of tiptoed out and was just standing on the edge watching everything, and all the parents thought that the boys were just staring down because they were so shamed and sort of in shame and deference, when really I was just nobody wanted to look up because if they look sideways, they would just burst out laughing. I mean, it was so pathetic how this forest house looked. It was it looked like one unlucky house on like a beautiful block had just been struck by lightning. And as they discussed what kind of work the boys could do to pay off the four thoughts insurance deductible, I listened and I really, I really had no impulse to laugh because I thought about how easily that sorry smoke bomb toss could have been mine. And so as they laid out chores that they could possibly do, I just thought, there, but for the grace of God, go I I feel sure. Now that's a true story, right, yeah, she said, She talked to her mom. Oh well that makes it true, right, So, Um, Chuck, I used to blow stuff up like crazy? Yeah, like, uh, model cars. Any guy's ever strapped like bottle rockets to their model cars and try and make them? Guys a rather like, oh yeah, dude, still do did you ever, um break the sticks off of bottle rockets and line them and just throw them and see where they go, Just see what happened? That's what actually I would. Me and my buddy Chuck built this. Uh. I had a friend named chuck growing up, either that or a very sad child. I built. We built bottle rocket guns in his little wood shop he had, like his dad made the little rubber band guns and sold them at fairs and stuff. So we modified those two hold bottle rockets and you drop it in and throw the little flap down and shoot them at each other. So what what kind of modifications are required specifically? Well, we we used the stock of the gun, it was like a rifle, and then we basically just got rid of the rubber band part and made a box with a flap on top like a door because you didn't want it to, you know, shoot back at you, so you would light it, put it in there, and we kind of dug out a groove so it goes straight. We put a lot of thought into this, and you know you would light it and then shoot at your friend bon Jovi. Yea, So did you patent that? No? We should have. Actually, yeah, we'll have to go home and hold him in Denver evidently. So, um, let's talk American dreams, shall we? Yeah? Man, the American dream as a thing. And you did most of this research and you put this one on me too. No, no, no no, I'm not putting this one on you, but I'm just, uh, I notice from your research when I looked at this, the American dreams sort of his ebbed and flowed from the it's early origins, and it's sort of coincides with like how the economy is doing. Right, then pretty much it's either like, yes, the can dream or oh it's dead, yeah, and then it's alive again, and then it's dead. And I also noticed the American dream is either like every man for himself and like you just do the best you can and make as much money as you can, or it's all about community and looking out from one another, and all that depends on how the economy is doing. That's right, because if everybody's broke, everybody's like, yeah, of course, government spending, that's what the American dreams about. And uh, if if everyone's making money, then you know, everyone turns into Patrick Bateman all of a sudden. So let's talk about it, Chuck. Where did where did this come from? Obviously it was the famed historian James Truslow Adams, who wrote the ninety one book The Epic of America, Right, yeah, and that's where he mentioned the American Dream, but earlier than that, in sixteen thirty, John Winthrop gave his famous City upon a Hill sermon to his fellow Puritan colonists, and um, he didn't use the word dream, but he did detail a vision of society where everyone could prosper, everyone could get ahead as long as you just team together and work together and followed the Bible, right exactly. But but that kind of laid out the groundwork for the American dream that in America, specifically, if you worked really hard, the sky was the limit. Right, that's right. Okay, So, um, that was sixteen thirty when Winthrop gave that City upon a Hill sermon. Uh, and then by seventeen seventy six when t. J. Sat down from June eleven to um, it was a god given, inalienable right to succeed because it's in the it's in the Constitution. We're guaranteed the the life, liberty in the pursuit of happiness. Right, that's right, which is kind of the the American dream in a nutshell, it's the pursuit of happiness. Yeah, does that? What does the Statue of liberty saying? Now, that's awful. I don't know that is that what it says there? Now, what does it say something? It says like yeah, all that other stuff. People are just shouting out words. He says, welcome to Shawnees. Did you see this? And it's not a torch, but it's a burger. So um, the the the the Declaration of Independence really kind of gives the lift to the American dream. But it's really it becomes embodied in the nineteenth century. Um, there was a guy named Alexis to Tokoville, right, that took this is a sort of a snotty thing to say, laughing. Yeah, uh, it might not have been a snotty thing to say, but because he was French, I took it that way. Um. He visited the United States in the eighteen thirties and he called this belief the charm of anticipated success. And that just sounds sort of like like it's not real, it's just the charm. He's British all of a sudden. He could also be a Nazi. Yeah you can do that accent. Um. I took it as kind of like a pat on the head or he was charmed himself. Either way, he was he was an outsider making an observation that the Americans over there think like they have this thing called American exceptionalism, which means there's no other country on Earth like America. Right, that's right, And that's what he was mentioning. And then um, I think it got another boost by Henry David Thoreau. Yeah, Walden, he really laid out the American dream as well. Yeah, and that was eighteen fifty four. And his quote, uh, actually like this one, if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and I'm gonna say her dreams, let's modernize this, uh, and endeavors to live that the life he has imagined, he will meet with his success unexpected in common hours. Can you see that in like one of those posters, it says like effort and it has that underneath there's like a whales tale. Back then, the Walden that was like it was a guy chopping wood. It was Thorow himself actually, right, he was the first guy to do an inspirational poster. It was a wood carmen. So that that's the mid eighteenth century. Um, towards the end of the the you know, the mid nineteenth century, I'm sorry, yes, toward the end of that you had a lot of immigrants coming and also a westward push, and so the American Dream kind of gets laid onto these two things too. It's actually written about. They use the words American Dream more and more in newspapers and you know, chok. Yeah, and magazine's the whole kind of thing where, Um, people love their ragaster richest stories in the late nineteenth century, right, but I mean they really loved them then, really like compared to today, it's like but so so everything's going and going. By the time the twentieth century comes around, Um, the American Dream is pretty much like code for upwardly mobile. That's right. That the persons living the American dream, rather than a promise to be able to try the American dream, is starting to become wealthy, Like you're wealthy. It's about the time of the turn of the century. And then by the time James Chooselaw Adams writes his Epic of America, Um, there's a lot of doubt, right because this want. Something really big happened that kind of put a ding in the American dream. Yeah, the Depression came along and destroyed a lot of these big fortunes and these people that had you know, live the American dream ras the riches, uh self made millionaires and the like, and h Herbert Hoover said, you know what, prosperities just around the corner, and everyone said, screw you, three rocks. That's right, But uh FDR came along and did usher in a little bit of real hope after that. He did even even before going to war, which I think most most historians kind of point to is the turning point for the American economy was all the military spending in World War Two? Um so I guess um. Roosevelt introduces the New Deal, right, which is again all the government spending social programs to the American dream kind of becomes more of a sense of community where America is a place where you know, you can not only make your own way, but if you can't make your own way, like you're elderly or you're disabled or whatever, the community is going to take care of you. That's right. And then we go over to Europe and to Africa and Italy and the Pacific and kicktail and come back and the suburbs are born, and then the americansumes just right on this up tick again. Right, so we're on the uptick of the roller coaster in the nineteen fifties. Americans at the time made up six percent of the population and consumed one third of the goods and services, which means we're doing great because you know, we're Americans and we're using up all this stuff, which is awesome. Wages rose, Yeah, that was pretty good. Uh, affluent workers moved, like you said, into the suburbs spread out, and I guess at the time that meant, uh, things were good if you moved to the suburbs. Well, I wonder if the suburbs were kind of a turning point as well, because when the suburbs started to hit their their stride, that's when the social strife in the sixties came along, where basically, um African Americans said like, hey, I'm really happy that you guys are having a great time over there, but there's this whole other part of America that's been left out so far. And MLK famously redefined the American dream. Yeah, he called America a dream yet unfulfilled. And he was kind of right on the money, and he said that it shouldn't be about wealth, it should be about Thomas Jefferson t J again saying all men are created equal and give equal rights to minorities, rebuild these inner cities that are decaying, and let's eradicate hunger. And people are like, wait a minute, I just thought I was supposed to get rich and moved to the suburbs. What are you talking. At the same time, their kids are doing the same thing. They're attacking them from from the from another side, right, waiting for them to come home from working, then jumping out of the closet. Maybe um and uh they they the the sixties are at their peak and the seventies hit and the economy just slides down the toilet. Whoever, So there's social strife and others economic strife and every at every turn, the American dream is analyzed in this context. Right, So, which is what we're doing. We're just following in tradition. That's right. And thankfully another French person came along to point this out. In nineteen seventy four, French historian Ingrid Carlander published a book called how do you pronounce it? Lazy American? It sounds very much like lazy American? Uh, you really don't like the press, No, I love the French. Um. She proclaimed that America the American dream was in fact dead, and uh that was pretty much it. And with the you know, the gasoline lines and the empty swimming pools and uh, because you know you shouldn't put uh. I think it was l a that suffered the drought and they were like, you know, we can't afford all this water for swimming pools even but luckily that was good for skateboarding. It was that gave rise to skateboarding, didn't it. It did, um And then out of California, out of the Promised Land, came the Golden Child, right, the former governor, a guy who came from a farm family, who had worked his way up to a star in hell Cats of a Navy, and uh he took over and basically Reagan, by the way, he said, the American dream is back, baby, I think is what his words were. Learning so and his uh deal very uh, the very simplified version was, hey, let's cut taxes and uh stimulate growth. Let's reduce some of these government programs because uh, we want self reliance and that's what it makes America strong. That's what it makes America strong Italian as well, and uh, you know it worked to a certain degree in America started to prosper again. But then critics came along and said, yeah, but you know what, we don't know about all this Uh how would really helped the common man. It may have just been the rich you were helping out and we don't really know if you cut spending that went who is that easy Chinese? Now? So uh, we we find ourselves now, um, after the the affluent eighties, UM and the nineties, which is just a party man. Um, we we kind of we we have kind of this hangover now where we have all this stuff, but we also have all this debt and like reality of like what you know, just buying stuff and just consuming without producing anything. Because remember back in um the forties or fifties, we were producing one third of the world's goods, but we were consuming that too, but we were producing as well. And then through the eighties and the nineties, we stopped producing and just started consuming. And we got to this point where this UM Harvard professor named John quelch Um pointed out that basically, too many Americans have been expressing the American dream through the acquisition of stuff, right, so now everybody's getting browbeaten with the American dream that's the point that we're at right, right, It's like it's greedy. Is that the point? I think what he's saying is it's kind of become greedy, like it was originally an opportunity and now it's how much stuff do you have? So what he suggests we do is go back to the original James truth Loow adams ideal of the American dream and through that allow it to survive, right, right, And we'll finish up with a quote from Adams, uh, a social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain the fullest stature to which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position. And how about that? That's right on the money. Truth was this is stuff you should know about America from the Sirius XM studios in New York City. Now more from Josh and Chock. So um, this is I would argue, I might cry at this part. When I was researching, I was crying, um laughing. We have one of our good friends here, Joe Randazzo. He edits the onion like we said, um, and here that it's a big deal The Onion. I've turned into a frenchman. Um and he uh, he was so kind as to go through their sevent three edition, right uh and come up with some great headlines for us to share from the era from the age. So everyone please welcome Joe Randazzo. Hi, Joe, Hi. How are you gonna wear of those? Yeah? Yeah, I like it. Joe put on headphones and now I feel naked. Why do you hear your hat on? I've got nothing that's true. I have to say that last segment I was staving off a panic attack. Were roller coaster ride ups and downs? What does the American dream isn't even achievable? Oh? I thought you because you were nervous. It was no, no, no, no, no no. It was terrible, nice, awful, terrible segment. So, um, how how did you end up panicked? Or? I don't know. I'm in the midst of it right now. We're gonna see what happens. Well, we'll take us through some of this. You you guys have been America's findest news source for how many well. The Onion was founded in seventeen sixty five by Friedrich Zwiebel, who was a Prussian tuber farmer um. And the only words that he knew, I think this is right, Joe were the an Onion, right, oh, mercantile and Onion. So it was founded as the Mercantile Onion Um with the express purpose UM of accumulating capital and fleecing its readers and y R N y oh and I own okay now I thought at the time though it was no, you're way off base. UM. So then so I was found in seventeen sixty five, and then the Mercantile and the Onion split in seventeen eighty three. Uh, and the Onion has continued on since then independently since seventeen three. So these are these are UM articles from our seventeen eighty three edition, which is technically the first issue of the Onion as it as it's now now. Okay, So they split in seventeen yeah, okay, Well we'll share with this some of the highlights of what was going on that year, because it seemed to be a busy a year from what I what I was reading. Yeah, it was a busy year. You know. We we reissued this in two thousand eight, UM, so that's a fact. So let's see where do you want to start. I mean, one thing that we like to do in Americans day is read books, right am? I? Right? Oh? I forgot the line I wanted to say. It was this amazing line American Dream more like American Night terror. Um. So this is just in this October three. These the top twenty best selling books in print at present UM a little section of the paper called Publisher's Corner. The twenty top most books in print at present. Number one's The Bible UM with two D three hundred thirty nine copies. Number two is Common Sense UH. The third most popular book is The Thousands upon Thousands of the Mohicans. Number four The Return of Common Sense Back to Basics, UH five, The Diary of a Woman Who Knew How to Write UH. Number six The Bible with a red cover. Number seven The Plowman's Diet. Eight top selling book is The Book of Blank Pages. Number nine is Leeches, a comprehensive tone of the known medical facts. Tend the Bible with the blue cover, The Gentleman of New Amsterdam. Twelve, God's Revenge Against Idleness a children's book, and We're thirteen Guide to North American Jews fourteen, the Bible German edition number fifteen, common sense three. It just makes sense spelled with the sea. It's a pun uh sixteen. The lever and Fulcrum for village idiots, Number seventeen, natural still birth and eight do not exist. There were only eighteen seventeen books. So that's a strong way to start write a list, rattling them off. You guys, what else is going on at the time, Joe ran dawzer Um, Were there any of these of interest that kind of stood out to you? I have one, yes, that I thought was pretty neat. The Surgeon General has added snuff to the tobacco period. That was a controversial move. Everybody's familiar, of course with the food pyramid, as I stall um. But I'll just read a little excerpt from here. So this is obviously this was written in seventeen three. The language is a little more kind of flowery and baroque almost, uh than what we're used to now. So this reads from our Baltimore cousins. Comes news of the felicitous health benefits of the powder tobacco snuff and the recommendation that multiple pinches be taken until blood flows freely from the nose and service of balancing the humors. Pre eminent barber, surgeon and former General of Loyalist Ilk, Thomas Haysworth has added the cure all physic to his famed and most singular tobacco pyramid. The robustness chart learned in grammar schools crossed the whole of our nation and has given snuff greater importance even than pipe smoke. Um, let's see. The measure of snuff, suggested by General Haysworth to be most advantageous for children under six years of age, is not to be an excess of four sizeable nose packings per four and twenty hours, and taken always with two drafts of strong brandy. Those unable to procure the finally ground tobacco should quaff freely from cuspadours at every opportunity to derive at least a little benefit from the meritorious effects of stuff. Obviously, snuff is no longer on the tobacco pyramids. In the seventies, in so Joe, one of the ones I ran across um was the there was a woman who wandered out of her house and they couldn't figure out what was going on. Yeah, she caused quite a stir A mischievous woman wandered outside of home. The headline, A mischievous woman wandered outside of home. I'll just read a little bit of this as well. The gentle town of Harrisburg was confronted with a most worrisome and shocking sight the day before last one, owing to the sudden appearance of wife and child bearer Margaret Cook from the interior of her home. Defying all reason, Cook was observed to exit into the open air, though no man had instructed her to do so. No domestic task required her to be out of doors, and no sign of suffocating fire had surfaced from her modest dwelling. Um, so she wandered around town, brought up quite a consternation, and then the last line of the story, Margaret Cook was reprimanded, disowned, and hanged until dead after returning to replace of residence. Tougher times one that you alluded to earlier. It was foreshadowed. Um. Today we're all interested in sort of news of the weird and these peculiar news items from around the world. World. I think that in the world's oldest person just recently die. Now there's a new oldest person. Yeah, um. So this um, the world's tallest man, towers at five ft and eleven inches. Should I read a little passive um from the honest and sworn captain of the bark Stilla, freshly returned from the Baltic news of the existence of a modern blong shanks, a veritable giant before whom many tremble said. Pantroguel, who makes his residence in the city of Danzig, reaches nearly six ft into the heavens. At an astonishing eighteen hands high. He is head and shoulders above even the loftiest of his brethren, and when striding the thoroughfares of Danzig, can be seen from thirty paces away. So colossal is he that master carpenters cut a hole above his door and raised the portal to accommodate his great head. This Ajax sleeps in especially fashioned bed, so that his lower limbs do not dangle off the edge. His tailor keeps a stock one surplus bolt each of wool and muslin. Should the Leviathan desire a new suit of clothes to him, our daily bread is but mere crumbs. The proprietress of an inn where the mammoth takes meals testified that he could devour one half of one one hundreds of his weight in beefsteak in one sitting. It is a further wonder that the floorboards of his house have not given way under his great heft, and that being estimated at nearly twelve stone or one hundred sixty five pounds. Um, that's it. He's a giant, five ft eleven inches. I've got one for you, Joe. We all have Ben Franklin, right, Yeah, invented lightning, that's right. And he invented a lot of things. And uh, from the historical archives, he invented so many things that they would actually print them week to week every week there was a future Ben Franklin inventions this week and I will go ahead and read a couple of of this week. I don't even know what week it was. This is I think the week of October. He invented the death kite. It's kind of needo. Uh. He invented the carton device for conveyance of eggs to minimize breakage on even the most uneven of footpaths. Yep, he invented the US patent. Are these all appropriate to read? Radio? I think the next one we shall not read. He also apparently that we invented power windows, the inflatable oblong balloon, the sort that hedmits a thunders one resembling sorry thunder's clap, one resembling the loud exhale from one's nether regions, the whoopee cushion, maidenhead glue because that one flies, uh and math and I love the last one he invented, being a great and pretentious old wind bag. Joe, do you have the one about the amazing public spectacle? It seemed like almost an advertisement or like an upcoming event that captured my attention, I do, Josh, and public is spelled with the K in this case, and that is right. That's that's right, Chuck, I have it right here. No, I need to do this. Yeah, so yeah, you know people still needed their entertainment in in the eighteenth century. Um so this was an amazing public spectacle. Indian taught to wear hat see the Savage Mohican, who, by grace of God and much patient training, has been taught to wear a hat in the manner of an actual human and amusing novelty for the public. Different times, but those are different times. Can we scoff at Alexis to Tulkoville. Again those one of the best moments. I like this one a lot. This was very important when a kidney being shaped organ recently discovered. Uh this was by uh cheer of surgeons and blood letters in Boston discovered in organelle of the body and that human excise from the back and modeled purple in color and very likely a kidney being in shape which removed when removed causes expiration as with all organs. I found it. Here's the kidney being one. Um. And then you know, even then there was some you did the the podcast recently on on Mouth's right overpopulations. They were even worried about this in seventeen three, this um sort of opinion piece will New York someday be too crowded for farming? An issue even more worrisome to experts is the reduced acreage of cleared forest available for farming within the city limits. Is a well known fact that no urban community can survive without an agricultural base on which to found the city's infrastructure. Um, go go on line and read it, really hilarious, read silently to yourself. And then there was another one about New York where um, the population was expected to to go over ten thousand, so it had already reached twelve thousand. It was causing a lot of concerns. New York is threatened by over crowding as population climbs to twelve thousands. And that that had a companion piece another worried one. Um where uh it was urban sprawl and then there's only thirteen thousand acres of forest remaining on Manhattan. Urban sprawling so severe settlements, cooking fires can be seen from as far as Greenwich Village was as true today as it was back then. Right, that's right, yeah, you got you you have anything else too. I was gonna say a fact, uh from real from the real history of the world, which was um Stuyvesant was the original governor of New York, I believe, and when he was banished from New York, he went to retire, uh in his farm in the West Village. That's where he went to get away from everybody was the West Village, New York. Only in New York. So thanks for coming by, Joe, thanks for having me.
