Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com? Brought to you by consumer Guy at Automotive we make garbine easier. Hi, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, as staff writer here at how Stuff Works dot Com. With me is always is the greatest edit tricks on the planet. Candice Gibson, Candice, how are you quick? Tell me what is the most expensive toilet in the world? Come on three? It is solid gold, y'all. It is a solid gold toilet. And it's not just this solid gold toilets part of this huge display, right, I have a solid gold laboratory right right, And there's actually um non laboratory parts of the displayers like gold Buddhist and stuff. But far and away the biggest tourist attraction here at Hang Funk Jewelers in Hong Kong is the solid gold laboratory, which is why it was such a surprise when Hang Fung announced early in two thousand and eight that they were going to start melting down parts of it, and people were mad, and not just because they had to get a really badly because you can't actually use the bathroom. The toilet is for a display, but it was just such an odd attraction. People wanted to preserve a fa solic old toilet for posterity sake, right, So Hang fun actually did start melting down parts of the laboratory because the price of gold had reached a thousand dollars. The dollar did weekend, thank you su Prime mortgage debacle, and gold went up, so Hang falling besides the cash in I mean, we're talking tens of millions of dollars for a ton of gold. And they assured everybody though that the solid gold toilet was going to remain. Can't say the same for you know, other fixtures of the laboratory, like the golden shower, the golden sink, that kind of thing. But the solid gold toilet remains. And that is the most expensive toilet in the world, indeed, and it's a testament to luxurious bathroom retreats everywhere. It is. That's kind of a big trend right now. Indeed, it really is. And now, you know, the bathroom used to just be another room in the house, but it really has become a sort of a spa retreat for people. People are adding uh, marble counter tops and sunken in tubs and um chandeliers in place of vanity lighting. It's it's huge right now. It really adds to the value of your home. So, you know, I actually read a study that showed that luxury bath upgrades return something like of the investment, which is just ridiculous. Kitchens are like, isn't that wild? And you know, it's funny, Josh, because the kitchen really used to be sort of the place where people would go to gather. You know, inevitably, whenever you throw a party, people end up in the kitchen and much to the hostesses chagrin. But um, now people are apparently congregating in bathrooms a because they're big enough, but b because just some are that nice. Well, you know, I'm not quite sure that the guests are actually congregating there. I think they're kind of assembled there against their will. But I read at least one article, one in the Wall Street Journal that was centered around this couple who threw an engagement party, a large one, uh, in their bathroom, and their bathroom, like you said, it was a nice one. It has This one had a coypon fireplaces and certainly lots of marble and all that. But uh, these people aren't just complete wackos. I mean, this is this is something that's becoming a trend in America. Bathrooms are starting to step up and say pay attention to me, pay attention to me, and people are doing just that. People are doing just that, and they have more reason to with innovations like the neo rest fix toilets. This is my favorite toilet in the world. I'd like to see even more than the solid gold toilet, mainly because you can actually use this one. And this is a really, really nice little potty companion. It actually opens its lid when it sendss you approaching, it warms so that your to doesn't have to touch cold porceline. Right, there's a there's a cleaning stream of water, a jet of water followed by a puff of air to dry you off. Pretty much the only thing the neoistics hunter doesn't do is talk to you. Wouldn't you agree? I agree? And so you've got this great near rest toilet where you're gonna do put in some schlovey shower or something. Now, there's plenty of other amenities too, that are available. Have you heard about this idle lux shower? I have not, Dude. This thing is a stand up shower, but it has a UV lights around it, so you actually tan while you're showering. Wow. That certainly is an upgrade from the bathrooms of your uh cess pits and which people used to urinate and defecate and open areas. Sure, yeah, but I mean what came after that? It wasn't a direct leap from cess pits to out houses, was it. No? Trenches came next? Oh, gotcha? Yeah? And then out house it's right, And then yes, and then aspensibly the near rest ascendered. Right. Yeah, it's pretty much the progression. It's like that a picture of the evolution of man, except with bathroom Now.
