Josh: Brought to you by the two thousand twelve Toyota Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff works dot com. Chuck, before we get started, let's plug our Brooklyn thing, our live event. Guys. We are throwing a premiere party for the TV show Slash Stuff You should variety show at the Bell House and Lovely Goanas, Brooklyn, New York. This is January eight, and uh this says tickets were covering a cost on this one and tickets are ten dollars. You can go to uh the Bell House in y dot com or just google that junk and go to the Bellhouse. Findus on the calendar January eight. Show starts at seven thirty. I'm sorry, doors at seven thirty. Show eight. Yeah, and we got special guests like comedians of music. John Hodgman is going to be there, other comedy ends. Do you want their stand up? Lucy warning right, Roach is gonna play singing with her pretty dang voice. Right, So we're going to have a nice little blowout agreed at the Bellhouse. Come celebrate with us. It'll be a fun festive occasion. Yeah. We love the Bell House and we love for our fans up there, and I'm sorry guys if we haven't come to your town yet, we would love to trust us and maybe we will. Yeah. So there, okay, so now onto the show. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always a Charles W. Chuck Bryant and um that makes this stuff. You should know the podcast. A right, is that a wookie? That is me messing with Sasquatch? It sounded more like, um, Frankenstein from starright Live. I remember that. I love that frankast Panto and Tarzan Tarzan classic skit. Have you seen the commercials Messing with Sasquatch? Yeah, Jack Links, it's pretty funny. Yeah, all of them are. It's one of my favorite spots. Actually, well it contradicts, um, I witness reports that paint Bigfoot is kind of a benign, shy creature. Now as far as Jack Links is concerned, he goes a gro when you, um, when you mess with him. I guess that's what it is. So I have an actual intro for this one. All right, let's here, we're talking Bigfoot and very recently there's some enormous huge news um and um, we should probably preface this one like, if you are a skeptic, don't worry, We're gonna give your side of this too. But we have found over the years that UM, it's very respectful to give voice to both sides. We try to and UM, we're not insulting you by speaking the other person's side. Will express your side as well, and when we do that, we're not insulting the other side. And at the end of the day, it's about Bigfoot. So let's not get so worked up. Calm down, you know, it's all just fun. There's a a self professed veterinarian with twenty seven years experience including forensics named um Dr Melba Catchum Melba s catchum and she supposedly she claims got her hands on some UH samples of Bigfoot hair and has been testing it do running genetic tests on it, and recently announced and wrote a paper that's under puer view as it stands now, UM that she she managed to isolate three separate nuclear um d NA. Okay, that that came from three separate groups. So one is the nuclear DNA. Remember, so you have UM. Nuclear DNA is the mixture of the mothers and the father's DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is strictly from the mother. So the researcher found the nuclear DNA came from a human Bigfoot, which is a hybrid of the human and this third species and non human species doesn't know what it is yet, but supposedly that's what this hair sample showed. Then this is just now right, Yeah, I believe they made this announcement like in late November, early December, which is now under peer review. It is under peer review. That doesn't mean that it's going to pass peer review, but she submitted the paper for peer review. Um. Now, she said that the the mitochondrial DNA in the sample was human, which means that this third thing, Bigfoot, is the product of a female woman and a this non human species, the mystery species reproducing and forming Bigfoot. And she says that she isolated it to about fifteen thousand years ago. Now, anybody who's followed Dr Ketchum's career can poke holes all in this. There was apparently I read an early draft of the paper that she said this third, this third um species was an angel and people skeptics love beating up on people like this. But my hat is off to her for first of all, undergoing this using the scientific method to root out um the unexplained. That's extremely forty in nature and I love that stuff um. And then secondly to put it up for peer of view and to face that that kind of criticism. One of the big problems that she she isn't saying like where this sample, how she knows this is a sample of Bigfoot's DNA. She didn't say where she got it, not that not that I could find. And I actually saw in one article that she's not saying where it, where it came from. So there's a lot of holes in it. But if you wanted big current bigfoot news, that's about as big as it gets. That's right. Uh, not quite as current as our our own law officer here in Georgia. Is that last year the year before the one up in the North Grogia. Yeah, man with with his freezer, I didn't follow that very close. I'm gonna go ahead and say that I really want to believe in Bigfoot or not want to believe. I want to. I want there to be a Bigfoot. I don't think there is that means you want to believe in, but I still want to. I want to believe it's out there, because it's just it would be so cool. And whenever, when when I saw that story, the sheriff and I think he's a sheriff or deputy in North Georgia. It was a hoax, of course, but he said he had a body in a freezer and they showed pictures of this. Uh ah, what you know? It was a guerrilla suit, right, that's what ended up being with and it had guts, had like animal entrails, but it looked like initially like, oh man, that looks like a dead bigfoot, and then you look closer and it's like a suit that you can get online. I wish I had that kind of time to do stuff like that. Yeah, apparently portrayed hoax. Apparently they were trying to try drum up, but potential business for leading big foot tours in North Georgia. It's a sound way to do it until you get found out and then ultimately either retire or get fired. Could still work. Oh well, okay he lost his day job, is what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, you can't do stuff like that. If you're a cop, you can't pull a hoax. Now, you can't pull a hoax and try and snow people for money. That's not that's not legal. I don't know that it is illegal to uh to snow people for money, to promise them something that's not true and charge This guy says that you call it fraud, No, it's a hoax. There's a big difference between fraud and hoax people. If he had the business, it would be fraud. No. That would be like if he promised that you were going to see Bigfoot, not a big Foot tour, but he said you're gonna see Bigfoot on this tour and he didn't, then you could get him for fraud. I think you would still be fraud if he founded that business and advertise it on a s premise, which is I found this thing. Look at it. Yeah, I see your point. Yeah, let's let's talk about Bigfoot. This guy up in North Georgia is pretty far from the only person to pull a declared Bigfoot hoax. Um. What keeps this thing going is that there's some stuff out there that's considered this body of evidence of big Foot's existence that hasn't been definitively debunked and right. One of the other things that I think people who are believers in Bigfoot, like the ones that are out there like looking for Bigfoot and believe in Bigfoot. One of the things that keeps them going also is this correlation between Bigfoot sightings among people of European descent and big Foot legends of Native American tribes long before the Europeans ever got here. And if you um, if you look at the names of that these different tribes have and take a step back, you're like, Wow, these tribes were all over the place. There, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, somewhere in Florida, somewhere in Um, the north, northeastern United States, and eastern Canada, and all of them have this weird um tall giant hairy man legend that they have a name for UM, even though they're you know, geographically scattered all over the place. And it's possible that they these all of these different Um legends share a single common ancestor that it's further back, maybe located on the steps of Eurasia, but it's also kind of noteworthy that they all have different legends for it. Him Alay is even the yetty incominable snowman in Asia very popular UM. Apparently you hear that one more than you see it. Yeah, which I didn't know. But we should call this thing sasquatch because that is the most common name they use nowadays. And um, even though some of the names from Native American tribes when day go yeah, yeah, that's correct, ohma, rugaru and books is some of the names that this has gone by Native American lord, but sashquatch, shash squatch comes from I have no idea how to pronounce that. It looks like sess shock anyway, that that word in another word from the area around British Columbia were similar enough that in the nineteen twenties, white school teacher named J. W. Burns coined the term sasquatch. And it's basically it's the umbrella term for any big foot like man, right, so we should. Even though these sightings have varied in their description over the years, there a few hallmarks that pop up. One is that this is a tall beast between seven and fifteen feet, which is that enormous. Yeah, I haven't most of the ones I've heard of between like seven or eight feet. Have you seen the troll hunter? I saw that recently. Actually, that first troll that they watched the guy s happen turing this tone. That thing was about fifteen ft tall. That's huge. Yeah, that was a pretty good movie. I'd buy ten ft no way, no way. Yeah. Did you like the movie was excellent? Yeah? I kind of got it kind of wore on me towards the end. I thought it was a little long, but it was pretty cool. Yeah, and the imagination that it used was just beautiful. Totally agreed. Un people, Um it walks on two legs, that's a big one. Was that bipedal? That what they say? Um, it's upright and has a loping gate. Um, he's seeing the elf right the movie Elf. Yeah, the one shot where they mimic the uh, the famous sixteen millimeter film where it's so it's Will Ferrell and Central Park and they like have that from frame three fifty two of the sixteen millimeter film. It's pretty funny. So Will Ferrell's doing sens. Yeah, it says like, you know, the strange Elf was seen wandering through Central Park and they mimic that. Yeah Frell. Yeah, it was very good. Um and then long reddish fur that's a big one, reddish brown. That's and that's really interesting that it's um, that Sasquatch is typically described as having long, reddish brown fur. Ye, that's a really specific thing for everybody report. And again it's possible that like people have heard other reports and said, you know, that's what they're expecting to see or that's what they're reporting because that's what Sasquatch has. But it's still it's significant. Um, you said that the YETI uh was more heard than seen. Bigfoot is usually more seen than heard. But when Bigfoot is heard, um that he makes gurgling noises, howling noises, noises that sound totally alien to the people reporting it. Yeah. I've heard weird noises in the woods camping all my life, and I've never thought, oh, that's a big Foot. I just think that's just something some animal making a strange sound that I've never heard because you live in the city, that's right. Uh. Supposedly this uh Sasquatch also has sort of a man like face, and reports from either being really really really smelly to not smelling at all. Oh yeah, that's not in this article. I forgot about how smelly Bigfoot is supposed to be. I've heard that many times. Um. They're also supposedly very wary of people, but also at the same time intensely curious about us. Um and Uh. A lot of people who have made eyewitness reports say that they weren't scared, which is weird. Yeah. Most people say that, like, I didn't feel threatened, right, and that kind of jibes with um. Most Native Americans legends about Bigfoot that it was Um, it's a a benign creature. Uh, and often it's it has intellect and um, it's given spiritual powers in Native American lore. So it wasn't something to be afraid of. Sasquatches, your friend. Yeah. Uh, they usually are by themselves, but there have been reports of several of these sasquatches hanging out together and chatting. Yeah, but for the most part they're usually alone. Right. Um. So you put all this together and you've got like a pretty good common It's like the A. K. C. Breed for sasquatch. These are its characteristics. I love it, Okay. Um. If you take this at at face value, which you should. Sure if you're a skeptic, you should always look at things at face value, not just immediately dismissed her poop po it. Yeah, trying to get to the bottom of it. And that's what we're about to do now. The first question is, um, could a creature that matches this description possibly exists? Yeah, And it's important when considering this to point out that we'd have never despite all the sightings and little still shots and film clips and audio clips, there's never been any conclusive evidence. They've never found bones, but that's huge or anything like that. Um, a lot of footprints and stuff like that. So moving forward, could this exist perhaps in the giganto Pithecus, right, because that's a creature that that actually did exist at some point. And it says here in the article that the gigant epithecis Pipthecus, which is the largest primate in the fossil record, lived between one and nine million years ago. Actually, I saw an article that had updated that to about a hundred thousand years ago, which meant that humans and Gigantapipthecus lived side by side. Have you seen this thing I have looks like a big foot, um, you know, yeah, And then like, oh, well, I guess if someone saw that in the woods, I would think it was a sasquad um. It lived in Southeast Asia or in Central Asia, and it's a relative of the orangutane. Yeah, big time. So it looks a lot like one. Yeah, this is all extremely interesting stuff in case you didn't know. Because orangutans, for starters, have reddish hair, reddish orange hair, so that's one connection to gigant Epithecus. Yeah. They've got the long arms like that. Yeah. Um. They walked up right about ten feet tall, usually about twelve pounds um. And if since orangutans are the closest modern relative of gigant Epithecus it um, it makes sense to kind of look at them, look at their behavior. Does it match bigfoot stuff? Yeah? They have teeth similar to humans, so that could account a little bit for the man like look that people often talk about. Uh. Make occasionally will make a loud howling calls. Uh that sound odd to other orangutans. Another thing that kind of separates them too, aside from being um Asian whereas most primates are African um, is that they tend to live solitary lives, so they don't aggregate in groups. They live by themselves mostly. Okay, so chalk one up for the big foot enthusiasts. Again, they're like, okay, well that's it's gigant epithekus. Uh, they live a long time, and because they are widely dispersed, they may not even see other orangon tangs for many long stretches. So of course they may not see a human either exactly. You know. And if they're intellectual or if they have intellect um, as people who believe in bigfoot like to point out, they would be able to successfully hide from humans probably sure, especially if their habitat was the woods and the mountains. Um. And so you put all that together, that they have a long lifespan, meaning there's not a lot of them dying frequently. They live, they're spread out population wise, and they tend to live in remote geographic regions. That if you add all that up, it's a pretty good reason why you wouldn't have found any bones. Yes, because bones candy k and the wild like that between five and ten years and um, the author of this was this the grabster. This is Tom Harris. I'm Harris. He's a good one. Um. He points out that that people have never gone on bigfoot bone hunting expeditions, so like people aren't looking for these things, so they may not have found him. Well, yeah, there is a guy actually who's um looking for Bigfoot, his Idaho State anthropology professor, and he has his crowdsourcing blimp to hunt for Bigfoot with thermal imaging cameras and stuff like that. And he's three and if you're interested in it, you can check out that I thought it was. But he's got his own website called Falcon Project UM and that's what he's trying to do with it. So there is at least one person trying to do a rigorous scientific hunt for Bigfoot. But and then there's all kinds of groups looking right. Yeah, there's even a show on Animal Planet, one of our h Discovery Channel stay stations, one of our I would call it a sister station, but I'm not a station one of our colleagues, and it's, uh, what's it called Finding Bigfoot? And these people are out there hunting Bigfoot. And I've even watched bits of it because I just think it's cool and interesting and uh, it's kind of a fun little show. So I recommend it. And weren't we weren't even asked to plug that. I'm just plugging it. You know. Um, do you have a possible link between the orangutan um right and big Foot? And that link might be a gigant Epithecus. Question is still remaining. Um, how did gigant Epithekis get here? Uh? Well, we walked over the Uh was it the land bridge bearing land bridge? Yes, yeah, just like we did not you and me. But you know, well that's one theory. Um. But the the big problem here, Chuck, is the absence of proof doesn't prove anything. The fact that we haven't found bones. Even though you can explain it, we still haven't found any bones, and it doesn't mean that something exists, and that's a it's a big problem in this debate. You can also point to, though very happily, the Ceila cant right. Uh. The Ceila canth was thought to have gone extinct sixty million years ago. It's a fish, I thought you have gone extinct in the late Cretaceous period, and then they found it swimming off the coast of Africa. So you can point to that and say it's entirely possible that Gigantapithekis survived somehow and we just didn't know. Yeah, and scientists are They'll point out that there are all kinds of creatures that are still undiscovered, but most of them are sea creatures. And that makes sense too, because we don't spend very much time under the sea, No we don't, um, whereas you know, we spend a decent amount of time in the woods. Um. Okay, So if you're a skeptic, everything we just said probably made the hair on the back of your neck bristle in irritation. And here's why, because, like we said, the absence of proof doesn't prove anything. Sure, um, And it's entirely possible that all of this evidence, this body of evidence, Um, it's just basically a bunch of independent hoaxters fooling a bunch of people over time. Yea or uh, innocent mistaken identity. They're not all hoaxters. Some people have perhaps gotten confused about things, said, boy, that mangie bear doesn't look right. It's standing up on its back legs too. Or the recent photo that was that still image captured at night and that's what they said it was was a mangie bear. But that thing was kind of weird looking. Yeah, it was like a night image shot and it was on it was on four leg or four you know, I don't know if their arms or what, um, and you know, it looked odd. But they you know, they explained it away as a mangie bear. Um. But yeah, lots of hoaxes over the years. Yeah. And if you go into the woods and you're even the least bit familiar with any kind of big foot loor and you see something that's that possibly fits it, you may be the victim of wishful thinking or being impressionable or what have you. Yeah, that's a that's a pretty good accusation a skeptical level against somebody who reports a big foot siding. And the first, um, an easiest way to hoax someone, to pull a hoax on someone is the old fake footprint. Yeah, not too hard to do. You make a fake foot you wear it on your feet, and you perhaps run along in the woods, maybe lope, maybe leap to make the footsteps, you know, the gate correct um, and then you make a plaster mold of it. The problem with these is there's in so many over the years that it's like clear that they're hoaxes. Because this one is two toes, this one has claws, this one has eight toes. And you know there are people aren't getting together on these and making them consistent. Um. Probably the most contentious bit of Bigfoot evidence was that sixteen millimeter film you mentioned that was made in nine seven by a guy named Roger Patterson, the Patterson Gimblin Film, and it's from Bluff Creek, California, and basically it shows Bigfoot walking across basically a clearing into the woods, and Bigfoot is aware that he's being watched, and he turns and looks at the camera. Like he said, Will Ferrell didn't help um. And I remember years ago like watching this and when I was back in my time life books phase like I'll believe anything, just tell me um. And they were saying that one of the reasons that this thing was so convincing that it was Bigfoot was that and he looked over his shoulder. Rather than looking with just his head, just turning his head, Bigfoot turns his whole shoulder and torso along with this head, which is something that a primate would likely do, and non human primate, I should say, or someone in an ape suit, we should possibly that's another possibility to They also point out that bigfoots walking with his knees bent in this that's another sure sign of primate, whereas I did that today. By the way, it is it hard, Well, it's not the easiest thing, but what it makes you do is sort of lope along with a kind of a funny gate, a loping gate. Yeah yeah, um, that's That's something that bigfoot enthusiast point too, is that this thing was walking with knees bent um. And I didn't realize this until I read this in the article. But humans lock their knees with each step. We don't walk with our knees bent um. And then also the lastly that the creatures fur is clearly rippling, like the skin beneath his rippling, and like some costume, some ape suit isn't going to do that on its own. Put all this together, and if you're a big foot believer, this is irrefutable evidence that there's such thing as Bigfoot. If you're skeptic, you can shoot a hole in all of the can't you sure? Um? Since this film came out in seven it's been like the most reviewed and made fun of or backed piece of evidence ever for Bigfoot or Sasquatch and um. Roger Patterson, it turns out, was making trying to make a movie about Bigfoot. Yeah, so he wasn't just some guy out there that happened to have a camera. He was trying to put together a film. Um. Since this has come out, there have been various people. One guy came out and said, you know what, I made the suit for him. He paid me a thousand bucks to make him the suit. Well, the guy who supposedly did make the suit is never admitted to. Well, there's a bunch of guys that's not the same guy. There's Chambers, and then there's this other dude. They aren't the same people. That's why it's it's kind of hinky because multiple people have claimed they made the suit. This one guy says that he was the guy in the suit, and Um, but his suit story didn't match up with the guy who claimed he made the suit did match up with his suit story. But then people said, you know what, Patterson could have altered that original suit to match the guy who said he was in the suit. Then there's Chambers, who other people say it made the suit, but he says he didn't make the suit. Well, it's like a long standing Hollywood rumor that actually John Landis, the director of American Werewolf in London. UM came out and and and said, yeah, this is true. Um, when he was a young pup. He was working at one of the studios and he became friends with John Chambers, who did the ape suits for Planet of the Apes, which came out right around that time. Right, Um and uh. He had heard that Chambers had done this, and he'd befriended Chambers and said, yes, it's true. This is John Chambers. And Chambers never has never taken credit for it. It's never come out and said yeah, I did it. But if you ask the average special effects guy or makeup guy these days, if you show them that, they're like, yes, this is ape suit. There's a water bag underneath that's making the skin ripple. Um. And I like that's a guy. That's a man. Right, I'll watched it again today, like five times. Yeah. I mean too, it's really neat. Yeah, it's kind of fun. I mean just the detail they went into, like the the crooked legs, the bent knees. Yeah, the shaky cam like it looked like someone scared and discovering something. Yeah, it's it's perfect. If it's a fraud, it is perfect because think about it. The thing was shot in nineteen seven. It's two thirteen and people are still debating whether or not it's authentic. Oh yeah, and it's it's gone through lots of rigorous testing by people that study whether or not the film was tampered, and they have determined that nothing was tampered post shooting, like if it was anything that was a dude in ape suit and they really went out there in the woods and shot it. Uh. But like I said, this is all just kind of fun to me. People get so worked up over this. I don't get it, you know. Yeah, what's the harm unless someone's like defrauding people out of money? You know. Um, there are people who dedicate their rears to this. There's a woman named um Kathy Moscowitz Strain, and she is a forest archaeologist for the U. S Forestry Service who basically became an anthropologist and an archaeologist so that she could hunt for Bigfoot. And she's very respected even among skeptics who counter all of her arguments. Um, but she is very much searching for Bigfoot and has been for many years, and she believes or just wants to get to the bottom of it. She believes that there's a Bigfoot, that there's another species out there, some primate species that is what we call sasquatch her bigfoot. Yeah, the arguments against Like, to me, if you can't say something like, well, somebody would have definitely seen it like by now and proven it, Like you just can't say that, like the Pacific Northwest is so vast that an animal could probably hide if there was only a few of them left from people, you know. But on the other hand, you also like can't say it exists because of this these hoaxes and these sounds, and like you need some sort of like scientific evidence. Bones, bones would help. You do need that unless you're just enjoying thinking about it. Yeah. Um. Another thing you can enjoy that's kind of related is watching the Ministry Science Theater three thousand of the Legend of Boggy Creek. To see that one. It's arguably the best episode that Oh my god, it's hilarious. Strong statement, but it's related. It's a based on a big foot like creature. Yeah. Yeah, Well, Tom points out to that the reason people want to believe in stuff like this is the same reason some people want to believe in aliens. Um that like the sense of adventure is seemingly lost these days. There's nothing new to discover, and God if we could just discover a big foot, that would be so huge and so monumental. Um, and I get that. That's probably why I want to believe. You know, it would rock the world of science. Oh it totally one. But then we put it in a zoo. Yeah, poke it with electricity, we humans. Yeah. Um, all right, well, uh let's see if you want to learn more about bigfoot, you can type that word into the search part how stuff works. Um, there's an adorable picture of a baby orangutan in this article, so you want to check that out. Um, that's b I G F O O t um and it'll bring that up. And since I said search parts time, if we listen to mail, Josh. Before we do listen to mail, you should quickly plug our TV show. Yes, stuff you should know. Television show. We call it that because it's based on our lives as podcasters. Stuff you should know podcasters. I played Josh, you play Chuck. Yeah, we're gonna change it around. I was gonna play you, but you just didn't work out. We tried. Yeah, Um, but this is a show about our lives and um here in the office, and it's fun, good stuff. Our picture a lie. Yeah, we should point that out. We're not giving away our real lives. But we recreated our office, we hired actors and but it's still just you and me doing our thing among them. Yeah, and it's on Saturday night, January nine. The premieres MPM Eastern Standard time. That's right, two episodes back to back after Aid Abroad Series three premiere. And uh, if you don't have TV, you can buy these on iTunes the day after the show comes out. You can buy each episode one at a time, that's right. Uh. And if you are used to Josh and Chuck short form video content, I fear not that'll still always be around as well. You can go to Science Channel dot com, Revision three the number three dot com uh, and always how Stuff Works dot com find some good Josh and Chuck video content as well. Let's right. Yeah, and the podcast didn't go anywhere. By the way, people ask us that we're still doing the podcast. Yeah we are. I don't care if this thing is the hugest hit ever, We're still gonna be the podcast. Yeah, thanks for saying that, Chuck. Okay, so stuff you should know the television show January nineteenth, that's Saturday, ten pm. Eastern Standard Time after the series three season three premiere of Idiot Abroad, starting at nine, We'll see you then, all right, listener Marlton, I'm gonna call this, uh, I don't even remember what this was, Oh meth showers, Josh Chuck and Jerry A k A L. Chuck Tran. My name is Jimmy Griffith from Leon or South North Carolina or Linois. I'm not sure. I'm originally born in Brazil. A relatively young listener, and after listening to how Meth Works reminded me of a story from my college days. I used to know these identical twin brothers that went to Appalachian State with me. You know what goes on in that school? Yeah, they beat Michigan with a bunch of hippies, bunch party kids at friends that went there. At one time, one of them was having unexplained hallucinations, see what I mean, and other weird psychological issues. That twin with hallucinations feared that he might have schizophrenia, but that did not make sense since this identical twin did not share the symptoms. As I understand, if one had the disorder, the other would also have it since they are identical, and that's right, that's true. It's probably like a percentage fail. Don't think it's automatic um. After dealing with his issue for a little while, the twin with hallucinations decide to see a doctor and, after running a few blood tests, tested positive for meth This made no sense since he had never used meth um. After a few questions about the daily routine, they found out that most of what they did was similar, except one of the twins preferred to take baths, the one suffering hallucinations, and the other preferred showers. Uh. This led to further investigation of the rental house they lived in. They found out there was a high concentration of meth on the bathtub on the portion of the bathtubs, which indicated whoever lived there previously made meth in the bathtub. As you'd expect, they shut down the house, which twins moved doubt the cleaning crew with hazmat suits moved in. The twin with the issues ceased to have allus and nations involuntarily. He says, I prop the need to point that out, and he came back to his old self. I just wanted to share that hope having a great week. Someday I hope to visit the studio in Atlanta and meet Jerry.
