Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant and Jerry's back. Yeah, where's that little plastic clappy machine? We can just Jerry's back. Jerry can I mentioned had surgery on her back to add a third limb. She does not have the third limb, but she uh is. It's been a while on her back recuperating, then eventually was in a chair and now she's walking around and now she can do push ups with the third arm coming out of her back. It's pretty awesome. But soon enough Jerry will be like pain free for the first time this year, which is very excited. Yes, but for the time being, she's on some pretty dynamite pills. Oh yeah, I to her. Um, Jerry, how are you doing over there? So welcome back, Jerry. We didn't know how much we missed you until you were gone for real. All right, again the applaustic that's about as much sentiments we allow. You know, my throat dried up. I had like some sort of adverse reaction to that. All right, let's do this. Oh really, yeah, man, fine, let's Davie Crockett. I should point out first off that when I was a kid visiting my grandparents in Memphis, Tennessee, Davy Crockett land, Um, I have a great picture, and people who always say, like, why don't you ever post the pictures you talk about? But I had this great picture of me when I was like five years old. Coon skin cap, fringe, vest, boots, little plastic bowie, knife, long muzzle loading. Must get. I think I know this very must get you're talking about. Yeah, so I was just like totally rigged out and of cessed with watching the old Davy Crockett show, even though it was like nineteen and that show ran the fifties. It was one of those deals like we still grew up on Gilligan's Island on these older shows. Well, yeah, I think Disney Walt Disney Presents or something like that. They ran a lot of that stuff years later. Yeah, I was way into it. That's awesome because I was into camping early on, and it was just really fit the bill for me. I love the song the whole deal. Yeah, I had a coonskin cap too, But so did Jerry. The only yes she did h the only extray couch from all I had was a deer skin water bag filled with wine. Oh yeah, yeah, a boda bag. Yeah, I didn't have one, but Emily does and she still puts wine in it and sneakes it in the concerts. All right, so let's do it. Uh so, Chuck, you you made reference to Davy Crockett from the fifties, the Disney thing, not Daniel Boone. No, Daniel Boone was prior to Davy Crockett. Davy Crockett became Daniel Boone's successor. Is the the um personification of the American push westward. For a long time, David Crockett personified the conquering of the Indian Um, the wrestling of the bear, taming of this land and through America, America. Although he spent like his entire life in Tennessee pretty much, No, that's not true. He went to Texas, he did, But he spent a lot of time in Alabama and actually homesteaded there for a little while around Talladega. Not for too long, though, for long enough. Like his family in Tennessee are all very adamant about being a lifelong Tennessee guy, right and in his heart he would agree with that entirely. Um. He was born in Tennessee, near Knoxville, Greene County. Yeah, he uh spent most of his life there, even when he argue and in O F t um, he was in Tennessee, I believe for the most part. Um. He Uh. His autobio bography was titled UM David Crockett of Tennessee parentheses really yeah not Alabama. Yeah, he went to West Tennessee for a while too. We'll get to all this, but yeah, let's go back to the Disney's a volunteer. So twenty years after, Yeah it is? Is that where it came from him? No? I don't think so. Okay, but because he did volunteer, maybe you never know. Maybe I wonder if that was like kind of a thing and it wasn't just him. But yeah, the Tennessee is the volunteer state, and Davy Crockett was a big time volunteer. Or maybe he felt pressure too because he was in Tennessee. He's like, I really the peer pressure state. Want to but I guess I must. Ye. Um, so Disney, I'm talking about Disney, whether you like it or not, No, but let's do it. I love that show. So twenty years after Disney runs five episodes, that's the run of the Davy Crockett Show. Yeah, there was only five episodes. I even looked that up because I was like, that can't be right. Yeah, I saw a hundred of them. Yeah, you saw those five times each. Um, so they in from ninety five and you was a kid in nineteen seventy, one full year before I was born, by the way, Yeah, I was four. I was still watching it, loving this stuff. So I had staying power. But what had even more staying power was Davy Crockett himself, because the Disney thing ran a full hundred and fifteen years after Davy Crockett died. Yeah, he was already kind of a legend in his own time as well. But this Disney thing, there was Disney Davy Crockett fever in the mid fifties. Yeah. They supposedly at its peak, five thousand coon skin caps a day were selling. Within a couple of months of the premiere of the first Davy Crockett episode, a hundred million dollars had been made off of the Davy Crockett franchise. Yeah, he just came on like a ton of bricks and uh, of course you know the coinskin cap if you Simpsons, Jebediagh Springfield as ensconcedin, was it bronze? Is that a bronze statue? I can't really tell. It's on TV and that cartoon form, so it's a statue. Uh. And we don't know for sure if he actually wore a coonskin cap. He did, Well, that's not what I saw. I saw that Daniel Boone did not for sure, and Davy Crockett more likely wore wildcatter, fox and possibly coon skin on occasion. I was gonna say that it was very apropos that that picture of you all dolled up like Davy Crockett was taken in Memphis, because that is supposedly the first time he wore the little fringe e hunting shirt and the coonskin cap when he had it out from Memphis to Texas, which we'll talk about later. That's what I saw, man alive. This is interesting, but I think this illustrates a really great point about Davy Crockett. There are few people who definitively lived who have more legends and possible half truth swirling around them then Davy Crockett yeah. I think some people out there might even think that he wasn't even a real dude. It's just like a tall tale guy. Yeah, you know, he very much lived. Um. And we got to mention the song. Well. First of all, Fess Parker started as Davy Crockett. Best Parker also start as Daniel Boone. Is that right? I guess they were like it's typecast that um. And he also the the TV theme song was sung by the Wellington's the famous song King of the Wild Frontier. UM. But in ninety four different people recorded it, and all four of them in the same year recorded the same song landed in the top ten. That's how popular that song was, or that's how just kind of um undemanding audiences were in the fifties radio audience, maybe so. But Best Parker did one of the virsions. He also did sang yeah, man, that guy made some dough off of Davy Crockett, unbelievable. Ironically, he was afraid of snakes, was he really? Isn't that a wine too? Best Parker h not a winery, not that I don't know of. That's that's a dingy winery right there. It's wine pass through. Best Parkers cap there's some winery that has a name similar to that. Best Parker. Yeah, no, nont know, Test Parker, I don't know. I know, I'm getting confused. So I tell him about the Davy Crockett, the U. S. Armies Davy Crockett. That was a rocket. Did you see that thing? Uh? No? Was it cool? Yeah? Yeah, it was in the nineteen sixties the Army. It was a artillery launcher lightweight that fired mortars that had nuclear warheads, and they called it the Davy Crockett. Yeah, it fired seventy pound nuclear warheads. That's what it was designed to do. And they never deployed it. But it was basically a bunch of pipes that like you drive up on your jeep about one to two miles away from the enemy. In Europe, the Ruskies, I guess, and assembled this thing real quick and dropped the seventy pound warhead mortaring and shot it off under the enemy. It was never used, though not as far as I know. It was tested and there's pictures of, like, I mean, it might as well be like a GHI Joe drawing, like the pictures of this thing being tested with like the jeep and the guys standing next to it, and there's like, it's just cool. You have to check that out. Yeah, Luckily, I don't think they anyone's ever set off a warhead on anybody in battle, aside from Herashima Nagasaki, aside from us. All right, Davy Crockett shameful, um alright. So he was born in Tennessee in six uh. At twelve years old, his dad sent him off to this dude, Jacob Siler, to help drive cattle to Virginia, and like, you know, as a twelve year old, like they're working hard back then, and this dude, the job ended up, you know, ended and the Silas guy like forcibly detained him as like a slave of sorts. And he was like, screw this, I'm gonna a hike seven miles in the snow out of here in the middle of the night. What's crazy is in two hours? Yeah, he ran it. I don't even think I could run on a flat plane seven miles and two hours. Well, they don't write songs and TV shows about either, No, they didn't. Actually, we did have a TV show in a song about us. Yeah, but we commissioned it virtually. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, alright, So he drops out of school while he does a lot of hooky, and his dad gets pretty ticked off at him. So he's like, basically, I'm gonna leave home at a young age because I'm not into the school and thing. Yeah he um. He for across his lifetime he became a very successful person. Um, and he kind of wore the fact that he didn't have much school and as a badge of honor, like he was very proud of how far he'd gotten in life without formal education. Um. But yeah, as a kid, he hated school. Is the impression I have. Yeah. He called it a strategic withdrawal. Left for two and a half years, came home like a grown person. It was like sixteen, and his family was like, who is this larger version of my son? And they forgave him and it was all good. Yeah. He actually stuck around and um, helped work off some of his father's seventies six dollar debt for a year, and went to school as a peace offering for another six months, and then said okay, let's to forget it. I'm gonna go make my own way. And this is when he begins to volunteer. That's right, volunteered with the Tennessee Militia. Yeah, his military career started. There lots of militia action going on, like he was in a bunch of different militias. It seemed like, yeah, and what he was part of. UM is one of the more despicable parts of American history, the removal of Indians, specifically, in this case, the Southern Indians from their lands. There was a lot of land UM in what are now the Southern United States and southeastern United States that was right for cotton growing, and there were a lot of people who on at that land, and there were a lot of treaties. Basically, the the militias would go in battle the Creeks or the Choctaws or the Cherokees or whoever, and UM then after their defeat, would force a treaty on them. And Andrew Jackson, who later became president, was personally responsible for nine of eleven treaties between eighteen fourteen and eighteen twenty four, which means nine of eleven Indian massacres. Basically the American h and there are massacres on both sides, and Davy Crockett actually took place in one of the massacres. A a attributive massacre, right, yeah. I think that was his first military duty. He enlisted to avenge the attack on Fort MEM's, Alabama, and with Andrew Jackson, Uh did so Indian massacre right, very sad. Yeah, it was the name of the town was Tolosa Hatchie and it was in Alabama. Um. And I believe they killed about two d Indian men and uh eighty four women and children were captured. And then whoever he's left alive, I guess Andrew Jackson came in and negotiated a treaty. They probably kept one man alive to sign the right exactly, and it basically said all the rest of you have to get off this land, but you can go west. And then as this happened time and time again, UM, more and more Americans moved south and established plantations around this time. So that's the context of what was going on in Davy. Crockett was volunteering with the militia basically. Yeah, and it seemed like he really hoped all over the place between like, uh, some military militia work, because these are when you enlisted. It was like a ninety day enlistment. It wasn't like years and years, UM and then like some political work before he you know, got real serious. He was a town commissioner for a little while. He was a Justice of the Piece for a couple of years. So he was just sort of floating around, a little militia work, a little political work, Indian fighting. Yeah, he was a man of many fringe jackets. I guess he really was. Well, uh, before we keep going, you want to do a message break, Yeah, I think it's a good time. And then things get serious for Davy Crockett. So we were talking Chuck about um, how Davy Crockett wore many many hats, and we want to say also that he although he was an Indian fighter and actually became very much respected as one. That's part of his initial legend was that he was an Indian fighter, which was very much admired among UM Americans at the time. UM. He eventually it parted from that image very publicly, but first he kind of had to create a public platform to do that on I guess right. Yeah, he Uh. He was a commissioner for a while in UM Tennessee, and then he was elected to the Tennessee Legislature and then finally in UM he won a seat in Congress. Yeah, his first his first like he was actual Congressional Representative Tennessee seven, that's right, and served two terms and then lost basically the third term because he came out so vehemently opposed to what Jackson was doing with like taking back the land. Yeah. So the Supreme Court ruled that, um, that that Native Americans had a right to occupancy. Yes, they can live in North America, but that is trumped by Americans right of discovery. Somehow they decided that we discovered this land that you already lived on, which trumps your right to live on it. Did that anyone ever? Say? No, no, no, we discovered it because we're here, right, And they were cut down where they stood. Um. So the the I guess the idea the issue of Indian removal in this time was being played out in the courts. Andrew Jackson becomes president, gets the Indian Removal Act passed through, which basically says, I'm the president, I deal with treaties with Indians. I'm taking this out of the hands of the courts, and I'm by the way, Andrew Jackson, And you know how I feel about Indian removal. Y'all can get out west right, and apparently this is egregious enough to make David Krack would say, you know what, I'm totally rethinking this land use policy, this land grab, the Indian Removal Act. And even though we're both from Tennessee and we're both in the same political party, I'm publicly separating myself from you and your policies. Mr President. That was a big deal on He lost because of it, he did, but he lost very narrowly, I believe two fifty two votes. Um. And actually, in our we have a video series people called Trapped in a Meeting, And in this week's Trapped in a Meeting, we learned that while Andrew Jackson was in office, he had an assassination attempt on his life. And Davy Crockett, this guy like this, this mentally ill guy, went to shoot Andrew Jackson on the steps of the Capitol. I think you remember we talked about in the Insanity Defense episode. Yeah, and Davy Crockett was one of the guys who subdued. He like jumped into action because he's Davy Crockett. Yeah, even though they already a post one another politically at this poet's still going to help save the President stand up guy. Yeah, Davy Crock he was. It turned out to be a pretty cool dude. Um. So he loses that after for his third bid, third consecutive term, he loses, uh, his bid, and um he goes off and starts making money by making and selling barrel staves, like the slats he used to make whiskey and wine barrels. It's apparently it's pretty lucrative at the time. Yeah, he almost doing it though. Yeah, there was a boat wreck on the Mississippi River carrying those barrel staves and he almost died then. And he almost died earlier in his life when he had malaria when he was home studying in Alabama. So he's he you know, he was a rough and tumble guy, you know. Um. Supposedly also during this time he killed a hundred and five bears in a year, killed him one when he was only three, which well, that's a Disney legend. And also we should say that the idea that he was a King of the Wild Frontier, that term, that label came directly from Disney as well. He obviously didn't wrestle a bear when he was only three, but he was a very well known bear hunter. Um. Whether he killed a hundred and five or not, that's kind of up for debate. But if you want to read his firsthand account of it, there's an awesome article called bear Hunting in Tennessee Colan Davy Crockett tells Tall Tales. It's on George Mason University's website. Check it out. It's he's a pretty awesome author. He was talking about how he's hunting with his eight dogs, and his dogs are the best dogs on the planet, flushing out bear. Um. And he saw some other fellas come up and they wanted to hunt with him, and they had like twenty dogs, but all the dogs were terrible. He said they couldn't bark at a bear without having to lean up against a tree to rest for a little while. Um. So he left the dogs behind and let him chew on some bare bones and he took his dogs out. It's awesome, like this guy is totally uneducated frontiersman who also went to Congress and kind of a humorous too. Yeah. I think the song actually originally went, um hike seven miles in the snow and two hours when he was only twelve, and they're like, let's just make something up. Killed him a bear. It wasn't even killed it's k I l T killed him a bar. Yeah. Yeah, um probe that song is still just like instantly comes in my head, the lyrics and everything. So he lost his third congressional bid um and then he starts gaining more fame and notoriety. And this is at a time where you know, it's it's it was pre internet. Yeah, was the pre internet a little it was pre Internet, and it was a time where it was you know, it wasn't the easiest thing to gain this kind of notoriety. Like that just shows how popular he was, Like he was one of the most famous people in the country. Um, they had these uh Davy Crockett Almanacs published um lots of books written about him. One lied and said that it was an autobiography to sell books, and the Almanacs actually came out of that. They used that book as the basis of it. Yeah. So so that just kind of perpetuated all these lies, and since it was attributed to him, that gave him a reputation for spinning tall tales about himself. But she didn't necessarily that that wasn't necessarily untrue. He just didn't spin him quite as much as as other people did about him. There was a play by James Kirk Paulding called The Line of the West, and the character Nimrod Wildfire was based on Davy Crockett. And um, he finally did get together with with of because as you said, he wasn't educated, so he had got a little help. But he eventually did write his own autobiography with with the help of a co author. Yeah, he did. And um you can very much compare it to Barack Obama writing The Audacity of Hope, because it was released at a time when the Whigs were starting to tout Um Davy Crockett as a possible challenger I guess to Andrew Jackson for the presidency. Uh A Native A Native A narrative of the life of Davy Crockett of the State of Tennessee by Thomas Chilton, and Davy Crockett was the official one. Yeah. So the problem is Chuck he Um didn't win his re election bid, so his his um idea of going into the presidency. The primary I guess in eighteen thirty six was that his plan that yeah, he was going along with that, and some of the Whigs were like, let's do it. But since he he was knocked out of Congress in eighteen thirty five, he did make a third trip back to Congress from eighteen to eighteen thirty five, but then he was defeated by a peg leg lawyer, yeah, named Adam Huntsman. Yeah. Um, very narrowly, but he lost. So I think at that point he was like, I'm kind of done with Congress for a while. Yeah, And that his losing to the that peg leg lawyer, as he was dubbed um, gave rise to his famous quote, Uh, since you have chosen to elect a man with a timber toe to succeed me, you may all go to Hell and I will go to Texas. And he was basically like, I want to go check out Texas and see what's out there. You know. This was like he didn't go westward, like, you know, to California anything like that. Like Texas was super west at the time. Yeah, and it was a Mexican state that was um in a struggle for independence. There was a rebellion going on there. Yeah, that's not why I went though. No, apparently he got caught up in that. But he went there just to explore and I was going to settle down with his family and just you know, live on the hand, right, there's a lot of money to be made there. Well, yeah, he said, what I've seen of Texas, there is a world of country here to settle. I had rather be in my present situation than to be elected to a seat in Congress for life. So he really thumbed his nose at politics at that time. Or he was just really happy too with Texas. Yeah, that's true. Um. He also it didn't take very long for him to get there, and I guess get caught up in the rebellion that was going on that really kind of spoke to him in his spirit. Yeah. They said he loved a good fight. Yeah. I think he just couldn't resist. Yeah. Um, well, I mean he was a bear hunter for goodness sake. Um. So he gets there and um basically aligns himself with the rebel movement who asked him in his traveling companion to sign an oath of allegiance to it, and uh, in it, it basically says like I Davy Crockett am pledge allegiance to this rebellion and any future government that may come out of it. David Krack is like, I'm not signing that in she put Republican before government because he wasn't about to sign his allegiance over to some you know, tyrannical government that came out of this rebellion. He didn't know. So he was one to head his bets, that's right, very smartly, so he signed it and um very famously, Uh died at the Siege of the Alamo, which I know you have visited the Alamo and there's no basement. There's no basement, and it's I always hear from everybody that visits. I have not how small it is. Everyone's always underwhelmed. It's basically like one room. Yeah. Yeah. Umi took me there and it's in San Antonio. You go in and you're like, it's this lump of history in the middle of downtown San Antonio. Yeah, and it's just it's like was this a bank or was it the Alamo? Yeah, I mean like there's it's just there's a couple of side rooms, but it's really just one main room. Yeah. I always just pictured, you know, some huge fort. Yeah you'd think so, And um, I'll visit it one day for sure. The gardens, the grounds are amazing. Yeah, yeah, it's it's very cool. It's worth going to for sure. Yeah. Well I love being historical landmarks. Do you know you should do south by Southwest to fly into San Antonio and drive to Austin. Yeah, that's what you did, right. So the Alamo is great. I'm gonna visit. He famously died defending the Alamo, but there are many versions of how that exactly that went down from um died surrounded by sixteen dead Mexicans that he killed with his hand on a knife in the back of one. Two captured and executed. Two killed at the very beginning of the thing and didn't even see much action. Yeah, but we think we have a pretty definitive story. Yeah, there's um some other stuff that he supposedly did do. Like he was um documented is running all over the Alamo, like keeping everybody animated, keeping one write exactly. UM. And he supposedly played his fiddle a lot like very rousing tune, just tried to keep everyone's spirits and energy up and they're defending the small little building. Um. He supposedly took out five gunners in succession who were trying to shoot a cannon at the Alamo with Old Betsy his musket. Yeah. And um. He also supposedly came very close to hitting um Antonio Santa Anna, the general who was leading the siege. Um, but just missed him, even though Santa Anna thought he was well out of range of the guns. And I see him, but there's no way he can do yeah, exactly. Um. So he did do some stuff. He's documented to doing something probably truthful. But the problem there was always a problem with how he died, in that he was captured, and a great brave Indian fighting bear hunter like is who represents all of America, isn't supposed to be captured because if you capture, that means you put your gun down or you didn't die fighting. Well, I supposed he ran out of bullets and then we started clubbing them with his gun, killing them with his you know, bare hands in a in a butt of a gun. Right, So that's the fictitious version. The other versions from eyewitnesses contradict that. So America long struggled with how Davy Crockett died. And then in um the diary of one of the Mexican Army soldiers who was there at the siege was published and um, it basically laid to rest, like, yes, David Crockett was among those captured. It was five or six people, yep, like everybody else had been killed or or um, we're women basically uh. And Crockett was among like five or six soldiers who were captured. Despite Santa Anna Um saying don't take any prisoners, they did anyway, Yeah, they did, but he was not. Um the account says that it was not He wasn't shamed, though he still died bravely. They were bayonetted and shot. And the quote pain is quote was the Mexican soldier whose diary these unfortunates died with complaining without humiliating themselves before their tortures. So I think it was like one of those Red Dawn scenes where they start singing America the Beautiful. Yeah, probably you know, like you're about to shoot me, but my head is held high, or like who is it we did last week? The the lady, Oh, Mota Hary, Yeah, Mota Hary. Yeah. Davy crock and Mana Hary they're virtually indistinguishable, that's right. So his reputation remained intact. And uh that the Alamo and then Walt disn't got a hold of it, and a hundred years later became a sensation. Yeah. I mean even even beyond the remaining in tech dying at the Alamo, defending the Alumo. It's like mushroom clouded his personality and his reputation is a legend. Like it just sealed it forever, like Davy Crockett, American hero, King of the wild front here. Yeah, Timbertoe No, not a Timber too. I actually had to look that up. I was like, what does that mean. I was like, oh, I wouldn't like got it. He was pretty clever. Oh and that quote, by the way, was said while he was drinking with his buddies in Memphis at the Union Hotel. And I did a little digging, and that is the Union Hotel was what is now the grounds of Auto Zone Park where the Memphis Redbirds playball. Oh yeah, yeah, I need to get back to Memphis. My family has all gone from there now, so aside from visiting the graves of my grandparents, there's really no other reason to go back. The grave of Elvis. Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, we'll go again, all right. That the station not gonna fund itself, Yeah, that's true. Um, okay, you got anything else, Davy Crockett? Oh, you know what, I have one other thing. Something occurred to me while we were researching this. Um, if you think of Davy Crockett and you're an American, it's just all these images come to mind. It's the national hero, and there's he's complex and everything. Think about how every single country has at least somebody like that, and just how totally unaware we are of those people that are like that in all those other countries. Yeah, like who was Finland's Davy Crockett exactly? Yeah, you know, but it's neat to think that there's somebody like that out there for at least one for every country on the map. Francais that Davy Crockett. I'm sure Napoleon Davy Croquette. Uh yeah. And you know what, in listener, man, we should ask for your country's version Davy Crockett. Do that. Okay, So until then, UM, if you want to learn a little more about Davy Crockett, you can me in this article that I wrote years and years ago, Um, by searching Davy Crockett in the search bar, and that's d A. V. Y. The early nineteenth century version of Davy and where else? What was that website we also used to get this information? Was that? Uh, if you look in the source the source list on the Lots More Information page of my article, it's in there. There's some good stuff. So I think it's like the Texas Online Handbook maybe ye, something like that. Yeah, and don't forget to go read that first person account of bear hunting with Davy Crockett on George Mason University website. Since I said George Mason, I mean it's time for listening now. Uh. This is about um e c T electro convulsive therapy that we've podcasted on and about civil rights of people forced into stuff like this, and it's from Jamie. Hey, guys, in your ECT podcast you mentioned anti psychiatry with regards to the resistance of e c T. Hope that one day you'll do a podcast about the Consumer Survivor X patient movement c s X. It's one of the remaining civil rights movements in the country and around the world. Mind Freedom dot Org is a great resource to start with. It was one of the first CSX organizations and insistence and still going strong today. Robert Whittaker A journalist wrote Mad in America, where he describes inventors of torture devices peddling their machines to various mental institutions which held the belief that patients can be shocked or tortured into sanity. Lobotomies were finally discontinued because storzine was introduced as the new lobotomy to a pill that metrosol injections and insulin shock were tortuous and highly feared by patients who received them. Much of when what went on in one flow of the Cuckoo's nest is still true for today's modern institutions, including forced east. Nowadays, the tortures are more subtle. I was on a drug personally called Howdall that to this day I believe would make an excellent torture drug. I was also literally blinded by another drug called h mellaril, which was forced upon me while in a hospital. My eyesight was restored many layers many years later, thanks to Emory Eye Center here in Atlanta, but I was never warned about the possibile side effects of mellaril or given a choice to take it or not. Today's modern medications routinely caused diabetes and rapid weight gain, as well as dependence in early death. When people try to discontinue their use, their face with symptoms far worse than symptoms for which they were originally treated. In fact, many school shooters were either on one of these drugs or drawing from them. When you do the research, I was a patient in the mental health system for twenty plus years and now I operate an alternative to traditional mental health services Indicator Georgia, which is near where I live. Recovery is possible when you reclaim your power taken from you in psychiatry, and guys, I'm not anti psychiatry, but I am no longer blinded or threatened by the tactics that they can sometimes use. I believe in civil rights for people who have been diagnosed and labeled as mentally ill. And please understand that anyone walking into a psychiatrist office can effortlessly walk out with the label that will follow them for the rest of their lives. Yeah, there's a stigma totally.
