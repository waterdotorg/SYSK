Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. Chuck Bryant's with me as usual. As a matter of fact, I don't know what I do If Chuck Bryant wasn't with me, I'd probably curl up in the fetal position in the corner and cry myself to sleep. I think you'd be just fine. I don't know, Chuck. I don't ever want to find out. Chuck. Well, thanks, almost didn't make it today. Why what's going on with you? I was out last night. I went out and saw Matt's band. As you know, Matt Frederick are handsome young stand in producer. Yeah, Matt Frederick of Stuff of Genius fame and awesome new video podcasts. We should mention, Chuck. It's really good. You guys should check that out, Stuff of Genius. It's it's a video podcast video and it's cool and it has a little like Monty Python esque animation. I like it. Yeah, And we don't want to hear any of this. I don't have time to watch that crap because it's like a minute forty two tops. Yeah, it's quick. Yeah. But went and saw his band last night, Lions and Scissors. Yeah, good stuff, And I wanted to say that they have a MySpace page and it's good music if you're into its very shoegaze, yeah, mag wise good is sort of a radio heady component at times. Explosions in the sky you ever heard of them? I have a big wall of sound, loud, my ears are ringing, and I'm slightly tired and imbibed a bit too much. But that was my night. That's Chuck's Thursday, everybody, So keep rocking, Matt. We love it. Yeah, way to go, Matt. So can we get back to our podcast now? Maybe? Yeah, But I just wanted to give give you a hard time. I think you're a good guy for doing that. Talented drummer, great drummer. Okay, So, Chuck, you grew up in the Cold War, right, it's pretty funny, jerk you did. You're a Cold War baby like me. I'm a Cold War kid. Isn't it weird to think we actually work with people who, like weren't cognizant that, you know, the Soviets had nukes pointed at us at all times and vice versa. Yeah, that is weird to me. Yeah, but um yeah, I remember being particularly unnerved from time to time that like, dude, eventually they're going to come over and or our missile is going to be sent over, and that's that, you know. I think I can't help but think that we were definitely shaped, our personalities were shaped by that underlying, constant level of paranoia that we grew up with. You well in the movies, uh, a lot, a lot of great Cold war movies of that era, but the Roosky is out to get us? Yeah, well, do you remember the movie Rooskis? Was there one called? It was actually a counter propaganda movie where a bunch of kids that were probably my age you would have been, like, you know, twenty by then. Um, where I think they found a Russian sailor who washed ashore and they had to hide them because of course, you know, the government would shoot him in the head if they found him. And they came to learn that the Soviets have hearts too, they know how to love. Was it a real movie? Like, yeah, it wasn't very good, but it was somebody actually put out the effort to say, you know, hey, we're all just people here, you know. Um, And what they were doing actually was counter propaganda, right, Like all the that was right off the cuff, two pounds um, all of the all the stuff we were told, I would say, at least the vast majority of it was lopsided at best. Like do you remember what did you think of the Russians when you were growing up? That they were like they cut your throat just as soon as look at you, And they were always standing in these horrible breadlines, and like every single one of them wanted to escape, but the Russian government wouldn't let her. They wanted up toilet papers. They heard stories about they don't have blue jeans and they don't have toilets. Yeah, like you could get you know, five wives with the single pair of jeans if you wouldn't ever the kind of thing. Yeah, well, I remember when the Iron curtain fell and like actual news started coming out of the the former USSR states that I remember thinking, oh, yeah, what a surprise. All of that was lies And they're actually kind of nice folks by and large. I'm not saying that they weren't trying to do bad things. When we were trying to do bad things. Well, no, I think that that was the Russian people were good people that came that. That's what I figured out when the propaganda ended, the Cold War propaganda ended so abruptly, is that we're all people like the average Russian is like the average American at heart, with the same dreams, goals, aspirations, same things that Kim or her. You know, it's the same thing. And we didn't want our stockpiles of weapons pointed in their direction either. You know, you're average American probably didn't know, certainly not I didn't either. Let's just get along, all right, So, Chuck, what we're talking about clearly is propaganda, right, which in just that word, A very smart person once said, um that propaganda is not a dirty word, and it didn't end with the Cold War, and that's actually true. But propaganda still has horrible connotations just the word itself, right, I mean, it elicits images of like brainwashed mass and that's it's definitely the case in most cases when it comes to propaganda. But there's a classical, more classical definition of propaganda, and essentially, Um, it's that it's simply a tool for persuasive arguments, Um, that use facts and beliefs, but omit facts and beliefs that that would persuade people to the other side of the argument, right. It's it's accentuating the positive in a way, and you never talked about the negative side of the things. Right, So it's sort of like Facebook, it is. It's very much like Facebook. Um. I figured out that, um through reading this article how propaganda works. That technically the truth campaign, you know, to to get people to quit smoking comcials, that's propaganda because they omit the fact that cigarettes make you alive with pleasure and flavor country. Right, So it's that's a little bit of both. I'm not sure we should say the brands because I'm pretty sure Big Tobacco would sue our parents. And you're right, you've come a long way, nice chuck, Um. So yes, But the the main hallmark of propaganda is that it includes omissions of facts, right. Um. And actually, the where where did the whole word come from? You got any you got any info on that? Dude? Uh? Yeah, started with religion way back, and it started, you know, hundreds of years before it was officially coined. But in sixteen twenty two, Pope Gregory was I need to work in my room in new Pope Gregory fifteen established the Congregation of Propaganda in sixty two, and that was basically trying to win back Catholics who had taken up the Protestant faith. Yeah, Martin Luther made a real damp in the number of seats in the pews every Sunday. So Pope Gregory formed the what was it, the Congregation of Propaganda. Um, and they, oh you did say that, Holy cow man, I gotta pay more attention. Basically, this Congregation of Propaganda, you know, one Catholics back by pointing out that anyone who doesn't take communion every week as a loser. And it worked, it did, sure, I'm sure numbers increased. So since then, you know, from that point until I don't know, the nineteen forties, there was absolutely no propaganda whatsoever. That's probably not true. No, you don't think that's okay. I need to read a little more clearly World War One? Are we talking? Are we're gonna go with the history now? I don't think we should get to that party. I think we should talk more about propaganda's implications. Right in the article, you you read that there was an interview with a guy named em Laine Bruner. Yeah, he's a professor of what rhetoric at Georgia State. Yeah, I didn't know that was such a thing. I didn't either, but it's interesting for him. Um. But Brunner said that the the distinction for him between good and bad propaganda was whether or not, um, the the people perpetrating the propaganda have the best interests of their audience at heart. Right, Yeah, but that's subjective. I agree wholeheartedly. I take issue with that because I think that it's up to the individual to decide what his or her best interests, all right, and to make the decision, you have to be fully informed. Well, propaganda is based on an a mission of facts. You're never fully informed when you're when you're being propagandized. Right, So therefore there's no such thing as good propaganda. Sure, you never see two both sides of the argument with propaganda, right, right, So that's I don't think there is such a good thing as I take issue. And he's a Georgia State. He's not too far. Maybe we should hop on the subway and go down him take issue with him. Yeah, I want to take issue with this, professor, I got some propaganda for you. Yeah. Uh, so, Chuck, how do you how do you get propaganda? Cross, Well, there's a lot of techniques actually, and these are pretty cool. And I know that when people hear these are going to be very familiar, maybe not with the name, but with the result. Yeah. Um, name calling is a big one. Yeah. I I found a poster I showed you. Um, it's a takeoff on that Shepherd Ferry right Obama political poster, but this one it's a slightly different picture. He has his nose in the air and it says snob under. It's actually pretty funny. Yeah, especially since you want it's a lot funnier because he won, right Yeah uh yeah, true. I guess that was done before he won. Yeah uh. And you know, name calling is that's just typical playground stuff. But they do it on large you know, on a large scale. Grown men and women in the political spectrum call people out. They'll they'll use names to uh, they'll use names like terrorists and trader and like evil doers. Stuff that nobody wants to be right. Not to pick too much on George Bush, but when you throw down words like access of evil and evil doers. That's propaganda definitely form Yeah, it is, it is, and it makes you wonder like what exactly is going on in Iran right now? How much propaganda we're experiencing from that? Sure, so that's one technique. Sure, you want to talk about the bandwagon, Well, bandwagon is pretty simple. It's like get on the winning side, dummy, you know, which is actually that example mixed name calling and bandwagon. Nobody wants to feel left out, and again this is pretty much a playground technique, which is still come with us, then you're and your other group, right, or you're gonna be left behind. All your friends and neighbors are gonna be cooler than you, smarter than you, richer than you, whatever, um. And you know, everybody wants to be a part of something good, you know. So yeah, basically with with the bandwagon technique, you're made to feel like you can be a part of something good if you join in, or be left behind if you don't. You got it. Thanks. I like this one a lot. The glittering generalities. Yeah, it's a great name. Yeah, this is really common in political propaganda, and that's when you combine words that have positive connotations the concept that is beloved. So basically, no one's gonna come out and denounce something that you call And I have another example, and again not to put on pick on Bush, but he was in office for eight years. There's a lot of years. You know, there's a lot of recent things you can point to, like the Patriot Act. Like anyone who would come out and say, oh, the Patriot Act is bad, then what you're not a patriot not supporting? Yeah, But and the worst part is is it worked. Yeah, although do you remember one of the original provisions was basically to turn postal workers into spies, and the post Office said, no, we're not going to do that, right, and it got left out. But they wanted postal workers to keep an eye on what was going on, to report on communities and individual people, right, Yeah, So other words you can use in the glittering general generalities or words like liberty and dreams and family and you you throw these words in there, and you know, God forbid you step up and say something that's anti family just because they tagged that name to it, right exactly, And all all politicians do this. We're not we're not gonna single things out. It happens all over the place on both sides of the spectrum. Yeah, it's just that Bush was in office for eight years, which I just said you should listen. Cards stacking. Card stacking is exactly what it sounds like. It's stacking. Uh, it's stacking the argument in the favor of one side over another. Right. Um, and again this is the is the one that where fact emission really comes into play, you know. Um And and it's most often seen in political campaigns where you know, one candidate is like Broadwater. Have you ever seen Ali g Yeah, did you ever see the barat where he follows around that candidate, Jim Broadwater. It's hilarious. At one point, he tells a voter that Broadwater is talking to that if you do not vote for Broadwater, Broadwater will take power. It's hilarious. And he compares him to Stalin. Yeah, and this is is poor you know Republican guys running for city councilmen. But yeah, have Betty last you didn't? He I don't know, I'd like to find that out. But yeah. Card stacking is basically just um saying, here's our candidates great, great attributes, leaving out any bad stuff. Well, details and statistics too, Like they'll throw out legitimate studies, but studies that don't mention the other study that can point out the exact opposite. Nice point, Chuck, card stacking like Facebook, Yeah, it's exactly. And then it is my favorite fear. That's a big one. So, Chuck, say we were to point out that the guys who host tech stuff uh steal babies in America and then sell them to human traffickers in the Balkans. You're saying that Jonathan Strickland and Chris Puette would do that. I'm just saying I've heard things, So I mean, don't you think would be a good idea to not listen to their podcast and all the people who are tech stuff fans maybe come over and listen to us instead, because we certainly don't steal babies and we would never sell any to human traffickers if we did. That's spaganda. Great example, Josh, thanks, of course, we have to do them on the tech Stuff podcast so they'd hear it. Yeah, good point. Uh, subliminal subliminal messaging. I'm sorry I should say it. Subliminally subliminal messaging. Huh. I feel like doing your bidding all of a sudden exactly, and that is, uh, that's one of the oldest tricks in the book. And that's basically images and whip. Yeah, it's oldest drick in the book. Now it's you know how it is. It's images and words that are so quick and abstract that you don't consciously recognize it. Again, we keep going back to politics because it's just so obvious with politics. But at any campaign poster for anyone, from it somebody running for school board to somebody running for president, they always have red, white and blue in them. They'll often have a star or the the there there'll be a wavy graphic that's kind of reminiscent of a flag. And none of these things are concrete like that that you never see the candidate dress as a statue of liberty. They're actually wrapped in a flag. It's a little more subtle than that, but it has the same effect. Obama symbol was exactly like that. The one that they designed. It was kind of looked like the wavy flag in the circle. It makes the Owen snob, It doesn't it does. I'll show you more closely. But yeah, so, and actually a really good way to kind of pick out this kind of propaganda. What it's called transfer, right, um, is to pretend you're from another country. Right, so all of a sudden that wave, what's that wave for? Or what's that star for? Like stuff we just take for granted that immediately because in our neurons are like patriot, patriot, you know, Um, if you imagine you're from another country, suddenly you deconstruct these abstract images and it seems a little clunky, clumsy, doesn't have the same effect. What these way they star exactly in Soviet Russia, wavy star doesn't understand you. That's good, thank you that what do? What happened to that guy? And then lastly there's plain folks propaganda, which is kind of weak. Actually, yeah, that didn't. That didn't strike me as propaganda when I read it, like kind of the politician trying to seem like your average ordinary, you know, next door neighbor American. Um, I guess it's propaganda if the article says so, But it never struck me as that. Well, technically it is, because it's an omission of fact. So you know, if they sure the candidate loves fishing, but is he really fishing in some rinky dink rowboat that he rented from like a local fisherman. Or is he on like an eight foot yacht, you know, using babies that he bought off the tech stuff guys bait or or what did they set up some you know TV commercial where they did take him to that farm in the rinky dink rowboat and said, hey, excellent points with you for five most decidedly propaganda. Yeah, so yeah, plane, folks, is propaganda to and Chuck. The more you start looking or thinking about propaganda, the more you realize it is everywhere it is, Chuck, how well it's it's it's where you would expect it to be, which is in print, on the internet, TV, radio, movies, you name it. Like I was talking about with the with the eighties movies and the Cold War, I mean every every action movie that came out, the Russians were the enemy pretty much, and then kind of later on it became Middle Easterners were the enemy. Like look who Rambo fought and who Rocky thought. Those were prime examples the Russian. But he helped the mujah hadein a k a. The Taliban. He did what in uh one of the Rambo movies the third Rambo movie. He and at the very end it's they said that they dedicated the movie to the muja Hadean freedom fighters and the mujah Hadein who we were funding to help fight the Russians in Afghanistan turned into the Taliban won. What Chuck Norris is not happy about that at all. He's been after still long since in right and show a thing or two? Yeah, so apparently, Um, according to one of the uh the the professor's interviewed in this article, UM, broadcast media like radio or TV is the most dangerous propaganda medium because people tend to believe it. Well, not just that there's no discourse, it's all one sided. It's all here you ingest this. And also it's it's much it's very entertaining. You know, your average TV shows usually more entertain aiming then your average AP news article. Yeah that's true, you know what I mean. But ironically it's the AP news articles that are generally the least propagandic. Yeah, you're right, because you think about it's like fact fact fact, fact fact quote fact quack. Yes, that's that's actually a quote in a fact quack. Um, and then um, that's it, right, there's not. It's pretty bare bones. I like those political commercials. Those are great. Which one, you know, the big time propaganda where they're where they're you know, this candidate, your family, stuff like that. Do you remember the phone ringing one? I think it was a Clinton add against Obama. It was one of the last ones she ran during the primary, and it was just a phone ringing. Is that when the phone, when the phone rings in the middle of the night, who do you want as president to answer it? Something like that? Right, Yeah, that's that's definitely fear propagandia. Yeah. Those crack me up, though, I mean the people that buy into those, that's what scares me. The commerce themselves. I get a kick out of it. I think it's hysterical. Yeah that anyone wouldn't say this is so one sided. It's what's mind bogglingly frightening is that it actually works on some people, so um chuck. Propagana also sometimes is not necessarily contrived. It just kind of comes out. Like I spent a few years as a journalist, right and I realized that it is really easy for your beliefs to creep into a story. It doesn't matter whether it's a story about somebody who just turned a hundred or um, you know about the war in a rock is as unbiased as you try to be, it's impossible to be totally objective. Right in this very podcast. We get taken to task occasionally by people that think we're communist, communists, anti religious, sexist, Bommy worshippers, that kind of thing. But we're not any of those things. No, not really, And if we are, we're sure not aware of it anyway. But you know, your belief system informs your outlook, right, so you know, just the very position you're taking, just the very approach to an article, there's eighty hundred countless different ways to approach an article. The one you choose, even if you're trying to be objective, that's a choice that's a bias right out of the gate. And you're gonna choose the one that you identify with that you understand more. Yeah, so again, I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you're getting news, only get it from a p not a bad idea. Thank you, Chuck. You want to move along, uh different types of propaganda, Well, let let's talk about the internet real quick, because I find this interesting. The Internet actually has the potential to totally undermine traditional propaganda, right, So well, think about it, like, if broadcast programming is the most dangerous form propaganda because there's no feedback, then the Internet would be the least dangerous form because there's nothing but feedback. Social media has just opened the Internet up to everybody in any crack pot normal person saint can put this stuff on the Internet and and get opposing viewpoints out there, so you can conceivably just be a fully informed person to make your own decisions, which completely undermines um propaganda, right right. The problem is, you know, facts spreading lightning fast just as much as that undermines propaganda. Um, uninformed ideas or facts that aren't really facts can spread just as quickly, and that helps propaganda. So yeah, and the Internet is just rife with that kind of time. What my solution, Snopes dot com. Yeah, they're pretty good. So let's talk about the different types of propaganda and wrap this puppy up like a Christmas president. Religious propaganda was kind of where it all began, like we said earlier, and uh, missionaries yeah, for centuries have been uh even and they've been traveling to other countries trying to recruit others to their to their faith. And this is a form of propaganda pamphlets and the posters that they hand out, and and we're not saying that they're bad people and that they're spreading lies. What we're saying is that's a form of propaganda when you only evangelize the one side of the coin, and they do when you go to these countries tell people that this is the answer right here. Well, you can also make the case that another kind of propaganda the article points out, but doesn't join to religion, thought reform. There's actually a form of religious propaganda as well. You know, if you're running around worshiping like a d deities and the Christians come along and say, no, no, there's just one, we're monotheistic. Now, that's thought reform, right right, Yeah, although you know generally they don't give up kool aid that's laced with sinide. Now that that's a very cult But you know, all those those types of political religious, well especially political and religious propaganda, they kind of um underscore our divisive nature, right like us versus them. And actually took an anthropology us once in college and the professor challenged us to go a day, just one day, without using the words us or them or any variation on that theme. And I defy you to do it successfully. You can't start now the day's half over. You have to start tomorrow. Just those two words. You can say, we know no variation on the theme of us in us or them. Try it. It's tough. I'm gonna forget about that as soon as I leave this, yes studio check. The big one, though, of all of them, is government propaganda, right right, which is illegal since nightficially, and if you think about it, that government propaganda is taxpayers paying to be brainwashed, which is why it should be illegal, right yeah, And it has been since technically, but w Mr Bush in two thousand five actually signed the Stop Government Propaganda Now Bill to UH to keep some like blatant outright acts of propaganda commit by government agencies, like when you pay television reporters to skew a message like planting stories, planting stories exactly. Yeah. And it also established some that audio in printed press communication state who the agency is that funded it, like paid for by blah blah blah blah blah, that kind of thing, And we we see government propaganda, most prominently during times of war, right like Hitler and the Nazis were masters of propaganda. He was the king of propaganda in world history, I think. Yeah, he cut Germany off from the outside world. He sold radios for next to nothing. I think he was driving around in the back of a truck selling him. He made sure the prices were loft so every German could afford one, so they could tune into his radio addresses and and hear how great they were and how awful the Jews and everybody else was. Uh, and and the portrayal of what was going on, like Germans living in the in other parts of the world were being abused at the hands of their host countries and things like that. Um, And it was effective. Yeah. And they also made movies, the famous Nazi propaganda movies where they, you know, made out Jews to be rats and Hitler to be godlike and it was And they didn't like the Gypsies much either, or Gays or Catholics. Yeah. Yeah, you forget sometimes you know that it wasn't just the Jews that were persecuted in the Holocaust. There's a lot of other groups. Yeah. And here in the US here state side we had our own propaganda as well. And also we should say um on our very enjoyable sister podcast stuf you missed in history class, They actually did an entire podcast on the Nazi propaganda machinery. Yeah, yeah they should. People should check that out. You can get that on iTunes too. But again, state side, we had our own propaganda, and that's something that have become pop icons, right. Yes, and World War two was when it really kicked up. Like if you think of the famous Uncle Sam I want you posters with Uncle Sam pointing trying to get young American men to enlist in the army. Yeah, that was new in the forties. Yeah, and that was a big, big time propaganda posters were very effective back then. My favorite I had two favorites. One of them is what what which? One Rosie? Probably Rosie is pretty cool, um. But there was one that had somebody riding in a car by by by by himself and it said, um when you it was for car pooling, right, ration gas and stuff. When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler. How great would it be to have one of those posters? Now, I'm sure you can find at least a replica Yeah, that's true. I mean that. That's the other thing about him is they're like great art. Oh yeah, propaganda posters have the best art. Yeah, I like that that that era. The The other one I like is just I just can't believe it, like that. These were up in in on public display. Um during World War Two. There's a Japanese soldier using the butt of his rifle to smack an American pow in the chin, and it says, what are you going to do about it? And below is the answer. And the answer, according to this propaganda poster is stay on the job until every murdering Jap is wiped out. You're kidding. It even has a little Government Office of Propaganda logo at the bottom. Look, I kid you not. That's something else. Yeah, it's a little nuts. So yeah, well you go a little overboard during times of war. I liked Rosie the Riveter. That's who I thought you were going to mention. Have you seen my favorite mechanic as a woman over indicatory riff on that? Yeah? Successfully too. Um Yeah, Rosie the Riveter was famous obviously because women at the time during World War Two were encouraged to help the war at home. On the home front by working in the taking these factory jobs that the men had to leave. And as she became like an iconic character, and one of the posters read longing won't bring him back sooner, get a war job. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, it is. It's pretty cool that I saw another one who was a woman holding a giant key and it's a food ration ng is the key to the war effort. And and actually that was one of the things that I don't think you could predict that came out of propaganda was um, women suddenly were uh put into their proper position of power. They were elevated to that that kind of power. They were no longer the mirror little houndsewives. They were empowered to like actually help with the war effort, get a war job, or to um food ration food or do whatever. They suddenly had a role. And not just women but blacks as well. There was a propaganda poster that said like united we win and it was a black guy and a white guy working side by side, decades before the Civil rights movement. Yeah, so sometimes it's um it's foreshadowing of social change and possibly even a mechanism of social change that follows. Whatever the the the issue is it's being propagandized. I think definitely in the case of women, I think World two probably had a lot of good benefits for women, kind of having a voice for the first time, or not the first time, but probably a really big, curly on voice for the first time. Yeah yeah, um and Chuck, that's propaganda, baby. Yeah. You know. I had a movie idea, script idea when I was during my screenwriting days about a film student that gets um, like he wins the big student film award and then all of a sudden he gets whisked away by the government to the secret Layer and they recruit young filmmakers to the Ministry of Propaganda and like the moon landing was fake and all these things have been faked or what. We talked about that in another podcast. But this, yeah, this kid gets caught up into making these movies that are all faults and have the dog. Yeah. It's a great one too. Yeah, sort of a riff on that And I never wrote it, and I don't I'm not going to. So if anyone out there's a screenwriter a longs that idea, feel free, Yeah, just give a shout out to Chuck at the premiere, right right, Yeah, so again that's propaganda, that is right. So are we plugging anything to We haven't add nothing, Holy cow. That means we get to go right to listener mail Josh today. I think we uh, since it would be appropriate to talk about Molly Orshansky. Yeah, are less subject matter there. We were talking about the women in World War Two. We were uh, and also we mentioned that we have been called sexists and mommy worshipers. You want to read the letter in question. Yes, we actually got a couple of letters, um, one which we're going to read now, and one that was kind of nasty and mean, and we're not going to read that or we're not gonna say that uh, nasty, mean person's name. But this one was much more above board. Uh. This says you probably have received a bunch of emails about this, but I wanted to let you know that Molly or Shansky is a woman. If you recall, she is a woman who developed the poverty line. But in your podcast how much money do I Really Need to live? You referenced ms. Orshansky as a heat as a female graduate student of public policy with a specialization in poverty. I was so excited to hear you mentioned a woman who was so influential to the field. But then I was stremely disappointed when you got the gender wrong. Obviously she had a right to be and I hope you make this correction on your podcast. And that comes from Cheryl Master in public policy candidate at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. And I wrote Cheryl back and thanked her for being kind since we had gotten the nasty letter calling its misogynistic freaks and it was a big mistake. We were wrong, and the research that we got actually referenced uh, Molly rus Chancey as a key and so it wasn't some big assumption on our part that it had to be a man. Great wait, Chuck, Chuck, I've been thinking about this. I think at this point we should make up a research team and lay this hot in their feet. I don't think we should take any responsibility to what spear you right? Right, So, Chuck Um, it was our research team that really uh dropped the ball on this one. It wasn't you or I We were misinformed. We did We did not assume like a couple of readers or listeners have thought that we didn't assume that it is a man just because it was some big college. It wasn't us at all that we don't do that cut. But to make up for the failings of our crack research team, who have been chastised, um since we got this pointed out to us, well fired, We fired them both. It's a different way of putting it. In this economy, you want to stay chastised. We didn't fire anyone. I'm just kidding. UM. So we did a little research into Maali or Shansky. We found out that she is dead. She died in April two thousand seven. And she actually was quite a pioneer UM in her field. She worked for the Social Security Administration from nineteen fifty eight to nineteen eighty two, and uh, as historian Alice O'Connor wrote in Poverty Knowledge, she was one of a respected but mostly invisible cardro of women research professor professionals based at Social Security Administration and other government agencies during the postwar years. And I think that's part of the part of the problem. I think, um, we as you know thirty early thirty somethings, well, one of us is in early thirty somethings in two thousand nine kind of Um underestimated what women were allowed to do, I think in the sixties. Right, that's fair enough. Sure so, because you don't hear much about it. No, they were, no, I know, and that is that is the travesty. And I even thought, like when we were doing that podcast, like Molly is a weird name for a guy. But I did too. Still, I thought it was an Irish thing, and I thought Mally Orshansky. I could see a guy being named Molly or Chansky, right, So it was. It was a mistake, I would say, much more notable or noteworthy than being invisible, you know. But successful was that she actually um has helped countless uh, impoverished people in the United States absolutely by creating this poverty line, which basically forces the government's hand into saying, Okay, if you're below this, we're gonna help you, right uh. And this is largely due to her work as a mathematician and statisticians. True trailblazer. He was a great man. He was hats off to you, Mr George Shansky. So if you want to say, and checking emails, taking us to task, or pointing out an error or just say hi. Whatever, gender confusion. If you want to call us sexist mommy worshipers, whatever, We accept all comers. You can send that to stuff podcast at how stuff works dot com.
