Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast Don't Josh Clark, Charles W. Chuck Bryant Old's with us again. Uh and uh, it's Morning Edition How Stuff Work. It's right. Are the Indiana Jones chronicles he's in this article. Man, you can't do archaeology without talking about Indiana Jones because you can't spell it without Indiana Jones. Uh. And do you know why? Because, as his article points out, archaeologists are one part explorer, one part scholar, one part P. T. Barnum, one part ps, one part scientist, and one part historian, which is true, and that is exactly who Indiana Jones was. Oh yeah, Plus he knew his way around a whipping and gun. Well, you know, if you're gonna get the ark of the Covenant, you're gonna have to whip a couple of dudes. That's what Steven Spielberg says. At least I know he got that across quite plainly. Yeah, the whipp thing was a good idea. That was neat throwback, although he never whipped a cigarette out of somebody's mouth, which I was waiting for. Like the whole movie. Oh that's a parlor trick. Yeah, well it's pretty cool. That's very cool. Uh did you have an intro? Did I spoil it? No? It was as good an intro as any you know me in archaeology. That was the first word I could spell. Um, was it? Really? Let me take that back. That was the first big word I could spell. I'm sure I had like dog and cat and all that down first, but I remember being in second or third grade and spelling it and the teacher being like wow, And I was like, yeah, I'll bet you're impressed because I'm young and I can spell archaeology correctly, and she said, guess it in the corner. The reason why I could spell it is because I had already been studying it for years. I've always been fascinated by archaeology. Yeah. I could have seen you doing this for a living. My buddy Jerry Um out in Portland's Jerry's both of our buddy different Um Jerry in Portland mail Jerry is Uh, Jerry purpose is a here you go. That's why we had last night. He was a history and I think anthropology major two and wanted to get into archaeology. So all those disciplines. Like it's a science that is heavily uh butted up against the humanities. It's pretty neat well, it's kind of absorbed them, kind of like some early bacteria absorbed um mitochondria, you know, and used it for itself the power. Yeah, but it's it's very much in that vein. Like archaeology started out as a very straightforward, simplistic discipline and at one point finally the archaeologists got bored and they said this, this could be so much more and they expanded, which we'll talk about when we get into the history of archaeology, but just the word itself, it does definitely conjure Indiana Jones um and he was one part this, one part that, And yes, archaeologists are that. But the entire pursuit of archaeology is so unwieldy. There's so much to it, documenting all human industry from the very recent past to the furthest reaches into human history that the the field is broken into a lot of different disciplines, and even those are broken further into subdisciplines, so much so that like if you take a forensic archaeologist and put it up against a glacial archaeologists. It'll be like, are these two really the same in the same field? Are they? They are? But they definitely you might not have a lot to talk about, you know, like how about that ice for success is going to how about that grave site? Like I have no idea what you're talking about. They're also broken into geographical areas sometimes or uh like time periods. Yeah, like you are a Mesopotamian archaeologists, like that's your specialty, and that makes sense. There's underwater archaeologists, which I think I I wrote a few of these articles back then. I think I did want to underwater archaeology too. It's so interesting that we didn't touch on. But that's super interesting because the trick with all archaeology is preservation. You don't just dig in there with a shovel and like pick up the vase like in the movie and shake it see what's inside. It's a lot more technical than that. And with underwater archaeology, you know that stuff is so fragile. You have to transport it in the exact state that it was in. So like if you find a book down there, you have to put that book in a tank of salt water at the right temperature a book. Well yeah, sure, okay, Well you know I'm not saying it's been down there a thousands years. I have this a stopwatch from the Titanic pocket watch. You have to transport it in a tank of saltwater at that temperature with the right amount of sand to wherever you're going to take it to your laboratory essentially, and then put on an expensive exhibit. Yes, exactly. Um. And underwater archaeology isn't necessarily just stuff that that sunk, although that part is so fascinating, Like things that are supposed to be above water that are now submerged just take on a whole different attitude to me. Yeah yeah, um. But there's other other underwater archaeology too that that goes beyond shipwrecks, Like they recently found a nine thousand year old um hunting blind in lake here on what Yeah, it used to be above water, and then after the ice Age, the water levels rose and covered it up, and they recently discovered it under a hundred ft of water. And it basically consists of some lanes of stone with a cul de sac yeah um, that they would kind of use to shoot caribou through, and then at the end they're like the Cariboers like cul de Sac and then death. Yeah, but they recognized this and then documented it under a hundred and twenty ft of water and Lake Huron. That sounds like it perhaps could have been an accidental find. Do you know. I don't know how they're looking for that. I don't I don't know. But the idea that you could look at some rocks and be like, oh, well, this is a hunting blind from nine thousand years ago used to hunt caribou underwater. That just seems really special to me. That is very cool. But I mentioned accidental finds because that's one of the neat things about archaeology. Um. If you're an archaeologist, clearly you are going to be have be in your bonnet to go find whatever it is ark of the Covenant. But there's things found all the time just by people who stumble upon them, accidental finds. Um. Because there's there's junk everywhere, like the cave paintings at lasco. Yeah. I want to say junk. I mean that in the like stuff way, in the academic sense, not worthless. It's all great stuff. But the less Go Cave in France was discovered accidentally by some local teens. Apparently there was a storm and a tree fell over and it exposed this cave entrance that had been covered for thousands and thousands of years at the Dead Sea scrolls. That was an accident. A nineteen seven a Bedouin shepherd found them and said, hey, these these are comportant. Yeah, what else for a little French schoolboys? Let's go? Oh is that? Let's go? Yeah? Okay, I don't know why she didn't put it in the article. Yeah, that is weird. She left out that one word. Um. All right, so let's go back a little bit and talk about how the stuff all started because in the you know, fourteen centuries, people really weren't too concerned about the past. Well that's not true. They weren't looking for artifacts the necessarily, or if they were looking for artifacts, they were just looting it and selling it and maybe melting it down for its gold. Like the the artifact that self didn't necessarily have any value simply because it was old. Yeah, that's a good way to say. That came about as a result of, um, the rise of humanism, which gave rise to the humanities, which basically prized art for art's sake, and um gave birth to the concept that antiquities have value because of their age. Uh. And then the the Renaissance. Basically it was birth from the Renaissance. There's a dude named Flavio beyond though that was my clumsy at times. You want to speak, say it again, Flavio energy into it and then your Italian. Yeah, I think that's my problem because I'm fairly low key, you know. Anyway, Flavio Beyondo was the first person to create a guide to the ruins of ancient Rome in the early fifteenth century, and a lot of people say that is the first person you can point to who gave rise to archaeology potentially and said basically, these things that we find, uh, maybe we shouldn't just melt down, maybe we should preserve them. This is sort of an important thing for the future, exactly right. Um, So he was one of the first and then from that point on the idea of um collecting things kind of took hold and it was a little nuts so for a while, like people would just go into it. There was no there was no aim to preserve the site itself. You just wanted all the artifacts from the site, so you could fill your palace with them. Yeah, and I get the sense that there was definitely a boom in the Renaissance and among royalty of wanting things from ancient Greece and Rome, and I know the Queen of Naples wanted, you know, ancient statues and things to fill her palace and uh, you know, trying to find out what happened with Pompeii and Herculaneum. Yeah, that's that's why they were excavated. In was after their stuff. And Pompeii is really neat, by the way, but all of the artifacts, it's totally deserted. Everything that's there is a permanent structure. All the artifacts have been removed and they're still in Naples where they were taken in seventy. Yeah, and we'll get a little bit later on into like who owns this stuff. That's pretty interesting. But Napoleon was a big proponent of archaeology. And I know we talked during the King Tut's Tomb episode about Egyptology, and he formed the Institute of Egypt basically a think tank in the late seventeen hundreds of a hundred and seventy five scholars, and it was just that fascination with Egypt and Napoleon was all over. It formed this think tank and said go find stuff right and like collected for me. And they published a book too that really kind of loosed archaeology and the idea of archaeology um on the world is called Description of Egypt that they published in eighteen o nine. Such a bland title it was, but it like created Egypt fever um and so that came out in eighteen o nine. In eighteen twelve, a British guy named Richard Colt or h. O. A. R. E. He wrote a book called Ancient History of Wiltshire in eighteen twelve and basically he described methods for excavating methodically. He also um was the first to identify what are called tells, which are mounds, ancient mounds of basically a city being built on a city on the city in the city, in the city that they've been continuously occupied for thousands and thousands of years. And then you know who else was a early archaeologist Harrison Ford earlier than him, uh, I don't know. Thomas Jefferson in the eighteenth century, late eighteenth early nineteenth century. He was methodically excavating burial mounds UM on Monticello, on his land at Monticello, in between rewriting the Bible. Yeah, he did a lot of stuff, um, but yeah, he was one of the early ones to methodically do it. So there's like all of this enthusiasm as in for antiquities and basically what amounts to looting and grave robbing. But simultaneously there's these independent gentleman scholars who are amateurs because there is no academic field yet, um, who are creating the UM basically the body of experimental archaeology. How to do it, the methodology, the best practices. Yeah. In the nineteenth century, a guy named Charles Lyell basically started um. They called it, you know, uniformitarian stratigraphy, and which is actually a pretty big hornets test, is it? Well, I looked in into the uniformitarianism period and the whole thing is but what does that have to do with dating? It was a dating system, Yeah, it basically Before then there is this thing called catastrophism where basically it was like the Earth is static and it changes only in the face of major catastrophes like a comet strike or something. He's the only thing that changes the Earth itself. Uniformitarian stread geography basically says, no, that's not the case, and it gave us what we now understand as geological processes geological time scales. It basically said, the Earth changes constantly, but our lifespan is so short we can't possibly witness it. But if you look at this, the processes that take place now are the processes that the Earth has always been subjected to. So one of those processes is sediment, sediment deposits, and you can date things thanks to sediment deposits because they're actually a predictable thing. So when you're digging in to sediment, you're digging into the past and you can date something you find in that sediment. That's basically what it gave our geology, digging into history. Yeah, that sounds like the idea that you can date from layers of ground. Yeah it sounds easy now or not easy, but it makes sense now, but back then it was pretty ravel. That's our world view now. But this is one of the guys who introduced it, Charles Lyle. Yeah, our hats are all to you, sir, And he didn't come up with it, but he was a huge proponent of it who gained a lot of traction with it. Uh, you're talking about methods in um Flinder Flinders Petrie Boy, what a great name. In nineto four wrote a book called Methods and Aims in Archaeology, and that was one of the first ones to sort of break down how it responsibly excavate the site yeah um, and not just to go in there and loot it um. And that was a big turning point that the twentieth century, the turn of the century. The find I think it's what it's called, yeah um. That was a huge turning point in archaeology. It really represented the when methodology took hold. Like there was a guy named Heinrich Schliemann who discovered Troy basically um and he uh just basically went in and started tearing through the sediment and he identified a bunch of different layers of occupation, but he didn't really document him like he should four definitely he had an assistant named Wilhelm Dorpe felt yeah, and he kind of took a different approach to it, a much more methodical approach. And all of this took place at around the same time. So like even on the site of troy Um. This change from pillaging to methodology took place. Yeah, they probably got tired of hearing their uh workers say broke, right, you know. Yeah, they're like, all right, well maybe we should slow down and uh it broke be a little more judicious with the shovel. Uh. Dating Um, old things is a big part of archaeology. It's no good just to find something. You want to know exactly where it came from because well, one reason, because it has more value if it's older. That was probably what led the dating charge. But um, there's a bunch of different ways they can date, and they have dated over the years. Uh. Something can be self dated. If you find treasurer that's stamped with a date, then it's done the work for you. Relative dating. If you find something that's with a bunch of other stuff that you can date, then you can probably say, you know, this stuff from King Tut's tomb is probably all around the same time period. Clay barbs counting, and that is counting varves, which are little laminated sediments that accumulate, and that can help you out for about five thousand years back. No, it can go even further than really, yeah, how far I mean as far as you want to go in the sediment. That's part of the uniformitarian stratiography. Oh, I was misreading and I'm sorry. Our written chronology only goes back five thousands, right, so you can yeah. Yeah. And then the idea we didn't give we didn't pay proper homage to um Darwin because his we did a whole show on him, right, But in this one um on the Origin of species um, the that presented the idea that mankind had a history, you that went back way further than a few thousand years, and that kind of inspired archaeology to look around for it more, you know. Uh. And then some of the more recent ones, which we could probably do shows on a couple of these, carbon dating radioactive carbon dating, potassium argon dating, and thermo luminescence UM that measures light energy and the intensity of light energy. Amazing, you can calculate the last time an object was exposed to sunlight through through thermo luminescence dating, and with potassium argon dating you can date things back two million years if you believe the Earth's been around the long so um. But just a little more about the history of archaeology, if you'll indulge me please. So methodology took place in the early twentieth century. It became about that time in academic discipline. Funny enough, they didn't start applying the scientific method to archaeology necessarily until like the fifties or sixties. But yeah, um, but it had its own method, and the method it among archaeologists was you find an artifact, you date it, and you catalog it. The archaeologist job was to date and catalog and ultimately contribute to this growing body of knowledge that was the timeline of human history and preserve obviously, but it was like, these tools are older than this tool, which means that the people who made these tools where the predecessors of the people who made these tools. That was it. Archaeologists got bored in the fifties, and they said, we're explaining how these um these tools have progressed, or human industry has progressed, but not why. Right when they decided to start answering why, archaeology became a far more interesting field. It became a multidisciplinary field, and all of a sudden, they're bringing in experts in ceramics, experts in metallurgy, and and grabbing all these people from different fields and saying how can we answer why this changed? What led to what change? And archaeology at that point in about the fifties or sixties became the very far flong, widespread, all encompassing, uh discipline that it is today. That's awesome. Yeah, so with help, Yeah, with a little help from their friends, from their expert friends. All Right, I guess we can talk right after this message, break a little bit about um, how things start off. If you want to go to gick something up. Okay, buddy, we're back. Uh. Field Work is a word that you're going to hear an archaeology a lot, and depending on who you talked to, it might entail the whole process or just out in the field, like at the actual excavation. But I think most folks nowadays consider field work the excavation and all the pre work. Uh. I mean there's a lot of research that goes into it beforehand, in offices and school rooms and libraries and what have you. And I think it's either all it's everything including excavation, or it's all the stuff that leads up to excavation is considered field work, right, I would call it predig activity. That's what I would go with that's where you go with. So excavation and field work are two different things for you. Sure, Okay, if I was opening up my own archaeological firm, that would be my model. Yeah, it seems to be really there's not a big problem with it either way. UM. So when you when you do find something, like you said, um, there's a couple of different ways things can be found. They can be determinedly, doggedly solid after which can be part of the field work, going through the stacks in the library, looking for references in ancient literature, UM, and just kind of trying to figure out where something might be. That's what Schlieman did with Troy. UM. He read the Iliad I Believe, which um describes the Trojan War UM and said look for clues. Yes, yeah, and and that's when he was like, I'm pretty sure this is where Troy is. Yeah, you're like a sort of a history detective at that point exactly which is Indiana Jones. After that, you may you have to go get some permits, vocal permits. Uh. And you're also gonna want to go get a grant because you're probably not going to fund this out of your own pocket unless you're somebody like James Cameron or whatever, you know what I mean. No, but grants can come from rich people who may want some of the stuff. Or maybe a museum wants to pony up some money if they really want a certain exhibit in their museum, right, or your university that you work for, UM should underwrite some of it. Yeah, but you get your you get your funding, you've got your grad student assistants. Maybe if it's gonna be a really big dig you UM put a flyer up at the local senior center. See if anybody wants to come help during the days because of the elderly would be good diggers, No, they would be awesome diggers. And here's why it takes a lot of patients to excavate a site. When you excavate a site, you're basically coordining it off. UM. And by the way, we've left at a really important point here. There's something called geophysical prospecting, which basically uses uh, some pretty incredible devices that measure differences in electromagnetism or electric connectivity in the ground and then basically gives you a pretty picture back saying here's something that's not rock. It's like an advanced super advanced metal detector basically UM, but it can also detect other really nuanced stuff like paint. It's in everything detected. Yeah, it's just good stuff. So you you're not just you may have read a book that says I think that this ancient site is here, but then you don't just start cordining off and digging. You do a survey of the site to look for stuff and see if it's likely that it might still be right. Yeah, that's a huge step that, if you may see, youre a terrible archaeologist. So I'm sorry we left that part out. Now that you've got a basically a subterranean map of the site, UM, you coordinate off and you start digging, usually by meter, and when you're digging by meter, you literally remove just one thin layer of that square meter at a time. Yeah, because we we've said earlier preservation is key and they were breaking things early on, and uh, one way to not break things is to go super super slow, super slow, just a little bit at a time. And I know everyone has seen the footage of archaeologists on their hands and knees blowing things with little little brushes, and it is that UM, meticulous. Yes, might drive some people crazy. It certainly would. Like construction worker guy probably doesn't want to be on an archaeological day, no, But it's funny you bring that up because construction worker guys often find themselves in the midst of an archaeological dig. Construction uh yields a lot of archaeological evidence. Like, for instance, in Miami recently, they came across a two thousand year old Indian settlement. Yeah, the te Questa Indians Um had a little spot in the middle of what's going to be a downtown of Miami's, you know, like their newest development, and the developers are like, fine, just take some pictures and let's get on with it. And the locals are like, no, we need to preserve this better. So they're trying to figure it out. But it happens a lot. Remember when we talked about the huge tunnel underwater tunnel they dug in Turkey. During construction of that, they ran into an ancient site, so they had to bring in archaeologists. That's what's called a rescue excavation, where it's going to be totally destroyed by a group of people who really could care less one way or another what happens to these artifacts? Um, in the name of continued industry. So the archaeologist comes in documents everything, the placement, all that stuff dates it. And then that what what is documented from the excavation that becomes the primary source for everybody else to follow. By excavating, you're destroying inherently. Yes, And each state in the United States has their own state archaeologists. Um. If you go to do a construction project in Rome, let's say, get ready for patients, because when you when you're trying to build something in Rome, I think they give out about building permits a year, but they require an archaeological evaluation of each one. And it's some say it can cripple uh progress in Rome. Yeah, but if you've ever been to Room, like, it's easy to appreciate the fact that they're doing that. Yeah. Sure, I mean it's just the city built up against ancient, ancient ruins. Yeah, it's really really wonderful how they preserved everything. Yeah, it's neat. That's the only place in Italy I've been but un Yeah, it was awesome. I think, Uh someone else with was complaining about how dirty it was, and I was like, it's been here a long time, right, Yeah, you know, no, it does have the funk of age over like the whole thing. But yeah, it's still you just kind of It's not gonna smell like Montreal. Does Montreal smell good? I think Montreal is noted for being pretty clean for a city. You can see that. It's a fastidious city. That's what I've heard. You've never been to Canada, do you haven't? I grew up near the border, so I've been plenty of times. Yeah, and hey, early early spoiler. We may be going out to Canada this fall, to Vancouver. Yeah, Vancouver, r It's listen up. In the near future, we may be coming to do some live show there this fall. Man, they're gonna go nuts if we don't actually go through with this, that they won't remember we're gonna go though, Okay, alright, So we talked a little bit about um, the transition from our from grave robbing to archaeology looting archaeologic sites and is still a thing. It didn't go away completely. So each country, in each state in the United States, like, everyone has their own way to deal with this stuff. There are a lot of archaeological acts that have been passed throughout the world to preserve things and to make sure there's not looting going on. But despite all their best efforts, it still happens. And uh, trying things like putting up a big sign this is don't dig here, do not enter. Sometimes I'm more of a welcome invitation. Yeah, so sometimes they get tricky in uh, in New York they do things like environmentally sensitive do not enter, So they'll try and trick folks into thinking that, you know, all you who enter will die. Um. But people pay money for artifacts still, and there is a black market. People pay money for artifacts, and those people are very frequently called museums well and private collectors. Yeah a lot of times apparently, like dinosaur bones are super hot right now, and Nicholas Cage has one that's contested. Um. It was it was known to have been removed illegally from a site that was never officially recognized um by basically some this couple that goes in and like they're really good at finding dinosaur bones, and then they sell him on the black market and apparently he's got a really awesome skull. Of course he does. Um. He also has a house in New Orleans that was this like a torture murder house in the nineteenth century that this really priestess owned and like that's his house in New Orleans, like the site of just blood baths. Yeah, he's a weird guy, man. I know. When he married Patricia Arquette, he did some crazy list of things, or maybe she came up with a crazy list of things that he had to do to marry her, and uh, he did them all and it was a lot of it was like a big stupid rich person treasure hunt like that was were creative than that. Oh I can't remember, like find me a black rose, um, all these things that are hard to come by. Then he did it and he married her and the divorced her. So it's a happy ending. Um. But the black market, sorry, back to it if you're in Peru. They estimate they have lost about eighteen million dollars worth the artifacts and goods on the smugglers market. And so they their Institute of Culture UM they register that register their historic sites and they require that all the collections are registered. UM. They've partnered with the International Council of Museums and basically all these international museums they're they're trying to get together to thwart the thriving underground archaeological goods, market goods, collectible goods. Sure, all right, but that brings us in. So that brings us to the interesting point on who owns the stuff. That's a great question. For a very long time it was museums UM because they were the ones who sent in professional looters archaeologists at the time UM to go in and basically rob a developing country of its antiquities and riches and history and culture. Basically. Uh. In a lot of cases, the government in charge of the time was totally complicit, Like for example, when um Yale sent in Hiram Bingham to Machu Pichu and he came out with a lot of artifacts from it. The proving government was totally in on it at the time. I'm sure that the high officials were getting tons of kickbacks from Yale for it. But nowadays, a hundred years later, Yale is giving back it's Manchu Pichu artifacts. There's been a big move towards trying to get back things exactly because the proving government has said, wait a minute, like, we're less corrupt than we were before, and this is cultural heritage, and that belongs to us, Like, yeah, you've had it for a hundred years, but like there was ours for thousands of years, so give it back. Not necessarily much. You teach you for thousands of years. But there are plenty of antiquities that museums have had for a very long time, right, but really belong to the source country. Yeah, and that's a big sticking point um every country. Like if if you want to know who owns an artifact, if you find something, let's say, Uh, it's gonna depend on where you are. Every municipality, every state, every country has their own laws as far as finders keepers laws they call them. Uh, if you're in New Zealand, a lot of them are dated by time. Like if it's newer than a certain age, go ahead and keep it. It's older than a certain age, you've got to talk to us about it. Uh, found not older? When it was found? Well, it depends on what country. Some countries have a date on how old it is, but I think the date is when it was found. Yes, certain countries for sure, when it's found, certain it's the age of the object. Um. It just depends on where you are. And but in the date of when it was found is usually the date that that comes after whatever act was passed. Exactly. So in New Zealand, for example, if you found something prior to nineteen seventy six, which is when the Antiquities Act of nineteen seventy five came into effect, UM, you get to keep whatever you find right right. If you found it after nineteen seventy six, then you have to you have to alert the local authorities. If you're in Sweden, UM, that has some pretty interesting laws. They say, if if there's more than one object at a site, then you have to report it to the government. If it's just one thing that you find, you can keep it UM. And they have a finder's reward to encourage people to be honest about it. UM. And if it's only the single object, you still have to report it. If it's partially made of a precious metal or copper alloy, but if it's If you're in Sweden you find an old wooden bowl, right, I love this example, and that's the only thing you find, then you get to keep it. Uh. It's really interesting though. UM. The United States says the National Historic Preservation Act and the Archaeological Resource Protection Act, and they claim I think the site must be at least a hundred years old and remains must be related to past human life or activity. That means you have to report it to the government. So it's like really like granular depending on where you are and what the law. That's just two countries, Like there's there's something called treasure trove law, which is basically it's this, but it has to do with finding a bunch of riches where that are old enough that the owner is clearly now dead, no one can lay claim to it, and that they were placed in a place where, um, they shows intent for them to be retrieved, like they were buried next to a tree or something like that, rather than buried in a grave, because the grave would indicate that they were meant to stay there with the dead body. So if you find a treasure trove, all sorts of laws kick in, like in in uh in the u K. In in England. You know, the Romans were all over that place, so people find like hordes of Roman coins, like when they're killing the ground in their farms, and it used to be like, well that was yours. That's not the case any longer. Yeah, sunken treasure, that's a big controversial area too, because a lot of those are private companies going after what they think is a lot of dough. Do you know the gold? That's where the concept of the camp thing going down with the ship came from. How's that so? Uh? I was listening about the fairy disaster and like the whether or not the captain was supposed to stay on or the Costa concordia. The tradition of the captain staying with the ship isn't that The captains just well, the ship's going down, so I'm supposed to die. The captain is supposed to stay on until the ship is basically totally underwater, and then he can get off. It has nothing to do with him dying. He's supposed to stay on because under maritime law, as long as the captains on the ship, it's not up for salvage. But the moment the captain leaves the ship, it's anybody's anybody who wants to go salvage the thing, like that boat has been abandoned once the captain is off the ship. So the captain is supposed to stay on until it's basically not salvageable anymore. Then he can he can leave that just so if a if a ship were just a partially sink, then then it's still salvageable and there's no captain. Yes, then you can claim it. Apparently that the captain is still you know, on top of the front of the boat, if he's anywhere sticking out of the water. He's like, I'm staying, so you have to stay too, bartender, that's interesting. Hit me up with a balini. Uh. UNESCO in nineteen seventy the UNESCO Convention established tried to establish some international standards for cultural property. Um. But here's the deal with all those international organizations. They can't demand that countries join, but they can encourage it, and more than a country, a hundred countries have ratified it so far. Yeah. But the thing is is like even if you join and ratify it, you can still violate it. International law is so toothless, it's ridiculous. But um, under that convention though, it's like you said, it's usually uh. They usually side with the source country of the object as far as ownership, which is good, and that seems to be the prevailing wind. Now, like the the if the source country wants to lay claim to something, you should give it back. It's part of a cultural heritage that got scattered to the wind in the nineteenth century when museums were again employing basically professional grave robbers to go get them a bunch of stuff for the museum's collections. And now the tides being reversed in a US. That's called repatriation. Remember we talked about that in the um the Shrunken Heads episode, Like those shrunken heads are being repatriated back to the source. Yeah. Part it is something that worked for a long time up until the early twentieth century. And that is basically, when uh, you dig up you let's say, excavate a site and you find a bunch of great artifacts. Um, the country itself keeps most of the stuff, but the digger can keep a couple of things. And they don't spell out exactly how many things because it was part. It wasn't like a law. But for a long time, if you like, you know, excavate a site, like hey, I want to keep these three things, you can have the rest in the Country's like great, that works great. It's like sharing almost, yeah, and it's not almost, it's exactly sharing. And so we're talking about the black market being pretty hot for antiquities and UM artifacts. There's this um group called the International Council of Museums that basically created a list um it's called the Red List that they put out I think on a regular basis, But then they'll put out emergency ones too when suddenly, like a black market in a certain area heats up, and it's pictures of specific items and descriptions saying this item and things like it are most likely to be smuggled and illegally sold in the black market because there's a big market for him right now. It's really interesting to go check out on the like the most wanted list for artifacts. Yeah, but they'll they're like, all the different artifacts that they have are really really cool to just kind of browse through. And they have a by region and country and stuff like that. What's it called, uh, the International Council of Museums. You go to their website and look for the Red lists. Those guys party too. Have you ever been one of those conventions? Accidentally? They are wild? Yeah. If you remember an International Council of Museums convention, you weren't there. You didn't do it right? All right? I think we should finish up with an interesting little bit about the Nazi Party because Hitler in the gang were way into archaeology because they believed if they could find proof that Germans were the original Aryan people's along with Thor and odin the Nordic gods, if they could prove that we were the original people's and we ran the earth, then that would give them the right to go in and take your country. Right. So they weren't just interested in things. They were interested in trying to prove that they owned the world pretty much. Yeah, that they were descended from the Aryan race, which was the proto Indo European group. Yeah, the mythical yeah yeah, yeah, so and that was I was not clear on that, like our did the Aryan race definitely exist? Well, I think the the Nordic gods, yeah, I don't know about that. Well, they would be mythical, but yeah, there were the people who worship them. They were the Arian race, right, I don't know. That's a good question. So I think that there was an Arian race in which we would call the Nordic or Germanic people. So I think whether or not what makes it mythical is the idea of whether it was some pure white race made it some master race in the eyes of the Nazis, so then it may have been a mythical people. We'd love to hear from you if you're an expert on early proto Indo European cultures. It was there a group called the Arians as far as the Nazis were concerned, Yes, there was, and that the Nazis were the new version of that, right, yeah, for sure. And UH and this started even pre war in n Himmler actually founded um, something called the UH. And this is German, of course, uh anina be that's what I'm gonna call it. A h N E N E R b E. Don't you speak German? Yeah, but that it doesn't look like a German word. It's weird. Yeah, it does look a little French. UM. And it was well, it was known as the Ancestral Heritage Research and Teaching Society. And one of Hitler's bigs big plans was, you know, when he took control of Germany, he took control of the education system, everything, and he wanted to flood that education system with Nazi propaganda. And so they formed this you know, they call it a think tank, but what they really did was a lot of archaeological digs all over the world. Um, like you said, trying to prove I mean we're talking Croatia, Greece, Russia, Iceland, North Africa. They were going everywhere trying to find traces of what they believe were ancient Germans in the original master race, right and Um. One of the places they went was Iceland because apparently that's where tool t h u l E was, which was the seat of the Nordic gods. Right. And they looked for um something called the Hoff, which was a place where they were supposedly worshiped by the Arians. And they said, we found it, we found this cave, this mystical place of worship. Um. And somebody else came along and said, no, this cave wasn't inhabited until the eighteenth century, so not the hof. Nazis and then the British and the Americans came in occupied Iceland and the Nazis were not able to come back. That's just one example of their failed expeditions. Right. Yeah, they had eighteen archaeological expeditions total, and none of them, uh bore fruit. They were fruitless. They were fruitless. They didn't provide any information that the Nazis were the original master race because they were not. That's right. They were just a bunch of terrible people, all right. I think you can say that I'm taking a stand on Nazis. I dare someone to write in and to defend the Nazis. Yeah, I dare you anything else. Oh you beat me to the punch. No, I don't, man um and uh. If you want to learn more about archaeology, how stuff Works is a veritable library of articles on archaeology, everything you could possibly need to know. Basically, you probably would get a degree if you read everything on archaeology. Not true, you could, okay possibly? Uh and um, just type archaeology into the search part how stuff works. Allow me to spell that for you A R C H A E O, L O G Y. Is that one of those you have to sound out in your head? No? Remember that was the first I was able to spell that word earlier. I remember, but I just know I see it in my head. Okay, I see the letters. I think everyone has those words still though as adults, you sound out that were difficult. One of mine, for some reason is because I always in my head at A B C, A U S C and I still do that in my head. Mine is uh pretty much anything with the C E I yeah, spread oh man, are not just words, and it's even got that accompanying rhyme I before you accept after see. But any time I see a C and there's eyes and he's involved, I have to go back and correct myself. Basically that's called putting learning into practice. That's a dumb I'm a dummy now okay, Oh speaking of speaking of dumb, I haven't yet, which means I can still go on forever. Go ahead. There are new T shirts available for people who like Don't Be Dumb. Yes, Josh's uh Tony Award winning web series, Uh would you have me confused? With Neil Patrick Harris? Again, I think it's great. I think any time if you're getting feedback where people are saying this is the best thing I've ever seen and other people are saying I don't get it at all, or I hate you for making this, that means you're doing something genius. Um. So, if you aren't familiar with Don't Be Dumb, you can check it out on our website or on our YouTube channel. If you are familiar and you want a T shirt, you can go to our store. Um, if you go to stuff you should know dot com you can get to our store in the top navigation and there are Josh sent me t shirt. Yeah that's great. Thanks, that's a good one. But anyway, since I said all that, I imagine chuck. Finally, it's a time at long last for listener and mail. I'm gonna call this um thieving mailman. I think this is sorry thieving garbage man. Um you're like, oh yeah, hey, guys, listen to how tipping works and have a funny story. Um. A couple of years ago at Christmas, my mom wanted to leave our garbage man a nice tip. She says, garbage man. By the way, we're not saying that because I know sanitation workers proper term. These are Emily Crawford's words. I should preface this by saying that our garbage man isn't like the typical city pickup guys. He has a small business and he comes to collect people's trash at their garages with his pickup truck. They must live in the sticks. My parents have a long driveway and don't want to drag the trash can to the end of the driveway, so they hired this guy. My mom put some money and a card and a white envelope um as the tip, and she didn't want to tape the envelope to the trash bags for fear of it being thrown away by accident. And it was wendy, so she decided to take it to this iron horsehead that we have sitting by a planter next to our garage doors. She attached an image, but I don't have it. Just imagine, you know, it's a little ring to his nose. Later that day, when my mom was, no, this horseheads because they have it like on the side. Yeah, they do. It's on the side like from their bridle. I'm talking about this picture I saw, trust me, I had a ring through its nose. Yeah. It was like a knocker show. Okay, I see that kind of thing. Uh So, later that day, when my mom was I love that I looked at this picture. You're like, no, it didn't look later that are or you're lying eyes. Later that day, when my mom was coming back home from running errands, she saw that the trash had been picked up and the horsehead was gone. The garbage man must have assumed it was a gift for him. Well, and he took the envelope in the horsehead. It wasn't valuable, but we also didn't want to give it away. We never got it back and never brought it up to the garbage man. But I laugh when I think about his reaction was probably what the heck? They gave me this envelope and a horsehead? Uh. And I just hope you put it in his house somewhere, So I hope you get a little laugh out of this. We did from Emily Crawford. Nice, thanks a lot, Emily Crawford. That's good stuff. And somewhere there that sanitation worker has your your family heirloom. Um, that's a good story. You know what. It reminded me of what the greatest movie starring Emilia Westeves and Charlie Sheen ever made, Men at Work. I never saw that. What I did not see it. That is a good movie. You need to see that. I know they're sanitation guys and they find something valuable, probably that someone else wants and so they're in trouble for it. But you just wrote the script. Yeah, no, it's but all the hijinks set ensue in the meantime are hilarious. Great supporting cats too, including Chainsaw from Summer school Boy. Man. I love your taste of movies. It runs the gamut, So uh? Is that it? That's it? If you want to tell us a cute story about your family, we love to hear those. You can tweet to us at s y SK podcast.
