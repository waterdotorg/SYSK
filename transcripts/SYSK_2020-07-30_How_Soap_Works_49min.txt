Josh: Hello friends, we have a book coming out finally and it is awesome. You're gonna make me say the title again. Yeah, fine, it's Stuff you Should Know colon An Incomplete Compendium of mostly Interesting Things. And get this chuck. You don't have to wait to order until the book comes out. You can do what we in the book biz called pre ordering it, and then when it does come out, you'll be the first to get, or among the first. Well, and not only that, you get a pre order gift. You get this cool custom poster from the illustrator of the book, Carli Manardo, who is awesome. We worked with another great writer who helped us out with this thing a great deal. His name is Nils Parker, and it was just a big team effort and it's really really cool. We love how it's turning out. Yeah, we do. So anywhere you can buy books, you can go pre order the Stuff you Should Know colon An Incomplete Compendium of mostly Interesting Things, and then after you do you can go on over to stuff you Should Read books dot com and upload your receipt and get that order poster. So thank you in advance for everybody who is pre ordering. That means quite a bit to us and we appreciate you. Stuff you should read books dot Com pre order Now, welcome to Stuff you Should Know, a production of I Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark and there's Charles W. Chuck, Brian over there, and Jerry flitted in and out like a little COVID ferry and uh, this is this is stuff you should know. I don't think you want the COVID ferry to visit. Uh, how about the COVID safety Faery. You want the soap ferry? Yeah, because the soap faery can take on the COVID ferry and smack that bword down. Yeah. And more specifically, it can pry it open and say, spill out your guts, yeah, correct virus. It's pretty amazing what it does. I mean, like soap just just from like just this research. I'm just fascinated with it. It's a magical potion. And I think the fact that like we have no real clue how we figured out how to make soap is just makes the whole thing even that much more delightful. Yeah, and knowing how it actually works is really neat. And hopefully this convinces some people that it does work better than hand sanitizer. Yeah, rather than just running your your hands under some water for half of a second then wiping them on your shirt. Yeah. So um, and we are talking about soap and I want to choke. Before we started, want to give a special shout out to Dr Brauner's because they are soap makers and they also requested, um this this episode years ago. Yeah, they rode in and said, hey, here's some free samples. How about an episode on soap? And we said, okay, we can't be bought with free samples, but an episode of soap is a good idea. So finally we're getting around to it. Yeah, and we had their uh big Jumbo daddy uh liquid casteel soaps by our sink here at work. Remember we had that that Casteel soap fight, the Great cast Steel Soap Fight of of of the Odds. Yeah, twelve. No, they're stuck good. And you know, if it wasn't for the fact that my wife makes soap, then I would I would be firmly on the Dr Brauner strain. I like their stuff. I feel like you can do both. Now. No, okay, Emily wouldn't allow that she's like you, it's never me. Well, I mean how about this. Tell you mean to open a business for twenty years and then say, I feel like I might like to use your competitors some as well. Okay, all right, all right, but I'll bet the people that Dr Brauner's use Emily soap. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe let's find out. Maybe they can write in so um so. Yes, Emily does make soap too. She sells it at I Love your Mama dot Com, don't she? Yeah? I mean I haven't had to buy soapen and fifteen plus years, it's been great. Do you help out making the soap I did in the early days. I've made quite a few batches in my day, but just not anymore. What's your specialty? Uh? Well, I mean I didn't have a specialty. I would just make whatever she told me to make. I got. It's funny, I've got I have to make genitals soap again. God, And that's not so for the genitals. It's soap in the shape of genitals and also for the genitals. Sure, I guess you probably shouldn't really make a distinction there. So, like we said, soap is kind of magic. Chuck and I feel like we just kind of off the bat talk about, um, why it's magic, because it's one of those things where science can explain it. But that doesn't really make it any less impressive, you know. Actually it makes it kind of more impressive, to tell you the truth. Yeah, and you know, what soap is is just a couple of things. Like if you were to go back a long time and we'll talk about the history, or go out in the middle of the furthest reaches of oh, I don't know, the jungle where people are sort of making their own versions of soap. You really just need a couple of things, which is some sort of a fat or an oil and an alkali and uh, that's really it. You know, people can use a lot of people through history have used animal fats and stuff like that. Obviously, Fight Club had the big joke about using lard from liposuction large I think, right, so that's fat too. But um, you know, Emily's is an olive oil based oapen. I'm a big fan of that. Yeah. Yeah, they figured out finally you could you didn't need to sacrifice goats anymore. You could just use s right. Yeah, the same ceremony it's just dinkier, that's right. So, Um, yeah, that's I mean, that's all there is two and an alkali in this case, Um, it's a well. An alkali in every case is a type of base. Um. It's the opposite of an acid on the p H scale, has a high pH and usually traditionally when making soap, it comes in the form of lie and and lie you can get by chopping down some wood, specifically hardwood you don't want softwood, burning it, taking the ashes, boiling them and then scraping off what floats to the top. You have lie right there, and that's one of the two main ingredients along with fat, like you said, um, and in making soap, that's it. That's all there is just to soap, right. But it's so you would have like you would never put those two things together that it's almost like it makes more sense how we figured out how to make alcohol, and it does how we figured out how to make soap, you know what I mean. It's not very intuitive, No, it's not at all, But that is what soap is. And we've been making it for at least about forty hundred five thousand years as we'll see. Um. But before we get to the history, Chuck, let's talk a little bit about how the whole thing works. Okay, Yeah, So you know you've got water and that's a key component to washing your body. And if you've ever heard the term oil and water don't mix, that's true because it's all about you know, it goes down to a molecular level and water molecules they like each other a lot, but they don't like oil. They don't like fat because the oil molecules are big and they don't have these poles that have different electrical charges. And it really is interesting that it comes down to literal chemistry in this case. Yeah. Do you remember, I think in our pepper spray episode, we explained why if you rinse your face off with water after you've been pepper sprayed, Um, it doesn't work. It's because the water and the I think the cap sasan don't bind together. But if you use something like milk, like a fat, that fat binds the cap sasan. So that's why you'd want to use milk to wash your eyes out after being pepper sprayed. Yeah, yeah, the end. So um, there's a very similar thing going on with water water, Like you said like to bind to itself, and that binding chuck is what it counts for surface tension, which is how you can fill a glass of water up with water slightly over the rim of the glass and it will hold its shape. It's because water molecules are so attracted to each other that they form like basically a well, a tense surface. Hence surface tension. So when you add soap, things change. Soap comes along and says, I see what you like, see what's going on here, but I'm going to shake things up a little bit. Yeah, And it's it's so cool because soap basically gets oil and water to party together. Uh. Soap comes in. They have these pin shaped uh ends and each end and it's it's almost like it was meant to be this way or something. They have very distinct ends and they bind with the water on one side and the oil on the other as if it was just made to say, you guys need to get together and clean things. Yeah. But not only do they like bind with the water on one end and oil and the other end that they have like polar opposite ends as a single soap molecule does. So not only does like the end like to bind with oil, which means it's oleophilic. It hates water, which makes it hydrophobic. And because that end is hydrophobic, it does everything it can to get away from water, including pushing through water and separating water into its constituent molecules, which loosens that surface tension of water um, which makes soap a surfactant, a surface active agent, which means that it makes water a little more permeable, like water can get into tinier cracks and crevices than it normally would because that that um hydrophobic end of the soap molecule is keeping the water from from coming together because it's just plowing right through trying to get away from the water. Yeah, that's the tail end. The head end of the soap has a little bit of a negative charge, and that says, all right, I really want to bond with that positive hydrogen atom and water. So that made makes it hydrophilic. So that end loves water, the other end loves the oil, and and and when they come together. And I love the way Dave Verus put it. He said, Uh, the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail act like a team of bouncers that's around the particles, uh, and say get out of here. And I think the one thing we didn't mention that makes us all work is the fact that uh. And the reason why just rinsing your hands off doesn't work as well as with soap is that all those all the dirt and all that stuff that builds up on your body has oil in it, right, right, So so let's let's give an example here, Chuck. Let's say that you have some cake frosting on your hands. Don't ask, well, you just you know how you take care of that. Yeah, but you've licked it so so much so that now it's kind of getting gross, okay, and you just need to You finally reached that point where you need thought you're gonna suggest washing that off of your hand, right, Okay, No, not that, No, that we're past that stage, the licking stage, and we're at the hand washing stage. Now. When you when you wet your hands with water, you get it nice and primed. Then when you add soap and you lather the soap up, what you're doing is you're you're introducing those soap molecules, which are again special magic little molecules, into this You're creating like a solution of soapy water solution, and so those soap molecules are basically trying to get away from the water on one side, and on that side they're saying, oh, hey, a little bit of oily hydrogenated cake frosting, great, I want to be attracted to you. And a bunch of different soap molecules are going to do that to a single little particle of cake frosting, and they essentially surround it. So the tail ends of a bunch of different soap molecules are all pointing inward, enveloping basically a little particle of cake frosting, and then on the outside they're connecting to the water molecules that are surrounding that. So that's basically stage one, and the cake frosting starts to sweat a little bit. It's like, well, what's gonna come next? What's coming next? I don't really like being surrounded like this without knowing what's coming next. And the cake frosting doesn't want to know what comes next because it doesn't pan out well for it. Yeah, so it gets surrounded and like you said, the tails are pointing in, the heads are pointing out, and it surrounds and basically traps the dirt and the oil and what are called my cells am I C E L L E S. And that's a little bubble around the dirt basically, and all those little little outside pointing heads lift that dirt from the surface and all of a sudden it's floating around a little bit now and not not bound to your skin. He's like, I don't know what's happening. And that's where your good friend water comes in to just wash it all down the drain. Yeah, Because so remember um, in addition to being oleophilic where it's attracted to oils, it's also a surfactan, so it breaks water molecules up, which means that that water can get into smaller crevices, for example, underneath that piece of cake frosting, So it makes it easier for it to just get carried away too. So it's all just kind of coming together into this amazing little process that happens every time you wash your hands and form those little mice seller bubbles. Um. That's where all those particles go. They just get carried off thanks to these soap molecules surrounding them, connecting with the water molecules and then just getting rinsed away. It's kind of like, um, you know that scene in True Lies where Jamie Lee Curtis is hanging from the helicopter and Arnold Schwartzeneger is holding onto her, and he's actually holding on the helicopter. So Arnold Schwarzenegger is the soap molecule, Jamie Lee Curtis is the cake frosting, and the helicopter is the water that's rinsing it all away down the drain, that's right, and the dirt saying I'll be back, and the sub saying no, you won't. Terrible the face of us retort to I'll be back. And the coolest thing about all of this, I mean, that's just how it takes care of the dirt on your body, which is amazing in and of itself. But it can do the same thing with viruses and bacteria, especially well, not especially, but including the coronavirus, because a lot of these things have this double layered lipid membrane, including the coronavirus, and the deal with that that hydrophobic into the soap. It's really really sharp, and so it can actually you get a bunch of those guys together, and it can wedge in between those membranes and kind of if you get enough of them pried up like it's a crowbar or something. And then that's when the virus is all of a sudden, you know, like Arnold Schwarzenegger just taking care of business. Yeah, it basically gets ripped apart by so many let's like death by a thousand paper cuts. But instead of paper, it's soap molecules, and the lipid memory that protects the virus just gets torn right open. It fills the virus proteins out, and those virus proteins actually um get enveloped by even more soap molecules. So not only does it like get rid of microbes, it actually like kills certain kinds of microbes. Just we're just talking about regular plain old soap and water here, everybody. Yeah, and you know, not to get to ahead of the game, But that's why soap is better for washing your hands during well, at all times, but especially during a time like this, because I think people just figure, like because we have this association with like alcohol and that smell, like it just kills everything on contact, but it doesn't kill everything on contact. And if you're in a pinch and you don't have soap, and you're at a store or something, and it's good to have that stuff to use, but uh, it doesn't necessarily kill it. And what you're not doing is washing it off with water and down the drain. No you're not, you're and so so there's two problems here. Um. Yes, it killed a bunch of stuff, especially things that alcohol and kill. But the stuff that it can't kill. You just basically gave an alcohol bath too. And it's still there on your hands. So when you do touch your face again, inevitably, um, those things are going to be introduced to your mouth, including things like poliovirus, which, as we learned recently, you don't want to go into your mouth. Should we take a break, I think we should, and then what we'll come back and talk history maybe, yeah, let's do it. Okay, all right, chuck, so soap. Like we said, we're not entirely sure how we ever figured out how to make soap, um, but we do know from records, hieroglyphics, cuneiform tablets, all that jazz that um. In Mesopotamia, people were making soap, you know, taking an alkali and a fat, mixing them together, adding heat into water and through hydrolysis, going through this process called supontification. Uh, and producing soap. That's how you produce soap has to have gone through supontification to be considered soap. Right that we've been doing this, we humans for at least five thousand years. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Uh. When I was making batches of soap that I heard that word a lot from Emily because I would you know, there's a lot of mixing involved, and I would think I was done with the mixing, and she say, it hasn't supontified yet, And you know, it's just sort of an easy test. You would lift the mixer out, kind of sling a little bit of it on the surface, and it's almost like seeing when a pasta noodles done. You can just sort of tell by the way it's that, the thicknesses and the way it sets, and when you finally reach that suppontification point, you're you know, you're right or rock. It's a great word, it is. I always called it. I would always say that we're pulling into suppontification station, which was my old joke. That's a good one. Um, So suppontification actually, Chuck, I didn't realize that it was from um uh legendary mythical mountain. Did you know that Mount Sappo? Is that the Roman one? Yeah? Yeah, that's the sort of the legend, and no one knows if it's true, but it sounds it makes for a good story. From what I understand, it is definitely not true, okay, but it does make for a good story, so we're gonna tell it anyway. So, yeah, in ancient Rome there was a Mount Sapo, and as the legend goes, that is not true. Ancient priests would sacrifice animals up there, and when it would rain, that animal fat from that disgusting animal sacrifice ceremony would flow down along with the wood ash that you already mentioned and was the Alkali and go down there to the river, the Tiber river, and people were washing their clothes down there, and when that happened, they would be like, man, this stuff sudds it up in. My clothes have never been cleaner. Yeah that's not just plain clean, Yeah, that's Sappo clean. Right, So U we, from what I understand, there's just no question that there is no such thing as Mount Sappo, and that this is all just kind of a made up the God I didn't know that that was fake. The Mount Sappo was fake. I just thought the legend was fake. I didn't like, are there Romans? Are they fake? I don't know. The jury is kind of still there are today, but we're not sure where they came from. Um No, from what I From what I know, there's not a real Mount Sapo. But the fact is the Romans felt compelled for some reason to say, where'd this come from? Oh well, let me explain with this made up story. So um and by the time this Mount Sappo a legend came around. I mean, people have been making this stuff for a couple of thousand years already. So it definitely did not originate a Mount Sappo because there is no Mount Sappo. But we do know the Romans were into it, not just from that legend, but also plenty of The Elder mentioned it in his Naturalists story of from seventies seven CE. You know what else the Romans were into? Yeah, they were into a lot of stuff. They're like, I got a great story for you about the soap. Come on into this room with these other thirty five people. Have you met my friend press. I'll tell you all about it. You're gonna love him. So they were definitely producing um what you would call soap though by two b c e. That was from Kurd and like goat fat and beech tree ash, and they would clean stuff in towns with that kind of stuff. They would wash their pots out. Other people would use it to clean cotton to make textiles and stuff like that. But it wasn't like, uh wasn't for personal use yet. No, that was like the one thing in common is people were using it for everything but washing themselves. Like I don't know if it just didn't hit upon them or whatever, but they didn't like Apparently the galls even used it to slick their hair back, not to wash their hair, just to slick it back and give it a nice little reddish tint apparently. But the but Europe, so Europe had like soap making guilds from I think the seventh century. For for a very long time people have been making soap in Europe. But it wasn't until after the Crusades that some of the crusaders returned um, as the legend goes in Mount mount Sapo style story, but they returned supposedly with Aleppo soap from Syria, which is fragrance with bay laurels, very nice, beautiful olive oil soap you can still get today. But the story goes that the returning Crusaders said, get this stuff. It's soap, but you use it to wash your genitals and you're up. Started to get very clean, at least like the elite aristocracy who had the money to afford things like that got very clean. Well, at least their genitals did, right, right. It took another three years for something and be like, I wonder if you could use this on your under arms as well, right, And they went, what about your face or like, you know where you've been washing with that stuff. It's true, it's got hair on it to prove it. Oh dude, that was too much for you. I don't know. I didn't even use the word pubic here. I mean we said the word genitals like five times. That's true. So that was That was how Europe supposedly started to come into soap. It was imported from the Middle East, but um in very short order, I think Spain started making castile soap um out of olive oil and it took off in France and England and elsewhere, and again it was a luxury item, but it was it became much more widespread when Europe started making it themselves. Yeah, I think the Castile region, right, didn't that where that came from. Yeah, And as long as it's supposedly originally was made from olive oil, qualified as a casteel soap. But even now you can make casteele soap from like palm oil or coconut oil or whatever, and it's still considered castele soap. So I think it's just a free for all. Yeah. Um, you know what I like about Emily's Liquid Soap and the Doctor Brauners is that it's how liquid soap should be, which is to say then, um, it's almost like has the same sort of viscosity as water. Uh. And whenever I see and I don't want to name like Slam a name brand, but let's just say the very popular hand soap that they've had around since the eighties, and the way that stuff comes out all gooey and pearly, it's just so gross, really, mother of pearly. It's really nasty looking to me now that I've seen like good real liquid soap. Yeah, so um. Yeah. And one of the other things I like about ket steel stub with um Dr Bruner's and Emilies in particular, is that your hands feel washed afterwards to it doesn't feel like you've missed any like there's a residue. It's like it's gone, but it also has left behind like a clean feeling. It's it's just its own thing for sure. Yeah. And you know, since we're talking about this, I uh want to say a huge thanks to people that went out and bought stuff from her store after the Essential Oils episode. UM We've given her plenty of shout outs over the years, and there's always been a little little spikes in her business. But I think the topic and small business and hurting because of the coronavirus and everything kind of came together and they've been overwhelmed with support and it's been really really sweet and a little bit much even, but it's been it's kind of like, be careful what you asked for, you know, right. That's that's um and Buzz corporate buzz speak. They say, that's a good problem to have. Yeah, So if you're gonna order soap, just wait a week or two. Okay, fair warning, everybody or just be prepared to wait a week or two. In the back end, Hey, by the way, you can also order something now too that you have to wait for, and that would be our book, an incomplete compendium of mostly interesting things, which you can order right now anywhere you buy books, and if you're lucky enough to live in the United States and Canada currently, you get a free poster as a gift or preorder. Wow, that's that was a nice segue, my friend. Thank you so for It took hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years, Chuck, think about us, thousands of years after the invention of soap before we finally started to use it on ourselves. And then apparently it wasn't until after the Civil War, at least in the United States that that using soap really took off, and soap making and the soap making industry became like kind of a thing all around the same time. Yeah, like I think Ivory soap was released in eight nine. Um, Paul Mallive was released around the same time. And I never realized Paul mall of soap is so named because it has palm oil and olive oil in it. Did you know that I didn't. But you know, I know those are two potential soap ingredients, and palm oil is a little controversial these days because of the way it's sourced. Yeah, and you know, we don't have to go down that rabbit hole. But just when you're shopping for stuff, just sort of try and figure out where that stuff is coming from, is all I'm saying. Um, and then let's see what else. Life Boy, the one that Ralphie hated so much. I was that Life Boy. Yeah, yeah, that one came out. And what was remarkable about Life Boy, UM is that it was Um. They were the ones who coined the term body odor b O as part of a marketing campaign to get you to actually buy in use soap. I did not know that. I feel like we must have talked about about that in our body Odor episode, you know, I don't know. I do like that Little Ivory story too, though. That Um. In eighteen seventy nine, a soap maker at PNG made a mistake, as the legend goes, and forgot to turn off the mixer and then that whipped a bunch of air in there. This is what happens when you over mixed something and uh shipped him out anyway, because he was like, I don't want to get, you know, pinned for this. And apparently a lot of people wrote in We're like I love that floating soap, and that was sort of always a selling point for Ivory was that it floats. Yeah, and the moral of the stories that they fired him anyway for withholding the information. That's right, Jimmy Ivory. Yeah, they kept his name. He kept his name. Uh. And then the hand soap uh. In eighteen sixty five, William Shephard patented the first liquid soap, but it took all the way until nineteen eighty when you know soft soap came around. Yeah. And here's the thing. Did you know the story from the Minnetonka Corporation. I didn't previous to reading this. This is so great. So the Minnetonka Corporation are the ones who debuted soft soap. And before then it was like you have bar soap, that was your option. But in Night they said, we're gonna release this and I think it's going to be a big deal. So we're gonna go around and buy up all of the the soap pumps that anybody could possibly use, and they cornered the market on liquid soap, just from buying up all the soap pumps. You think that's a good thing before they release as far as like from the lens of a robber baron. Okay, it's a great thing. It's like it seems like a jerk move to me. At the very least. It's a good story, you know. And everyone they talked to you, they were like, oh, no, go out and make liquid soap. What you're gonna put it in? Yeah? What are you gonna do? Deliver it by hand to people and just be like here, hold your hands, to cut your hands. We'll give you some of our liquid soap. You gotta wrap in paper. I don't think so it's true. Oh and speaking you wrapped in paper, I have one more little piece of lower soap. Lower. Do you ever use Irish spring? I did in college. Okay, yeah, that's the appropriate time to use Irish spring. Father um. Do you know that scent? There's actually a name for it. It's not like publicly named, but internally I think Colgate palm Olive. It's called Ulster scent Ulster fragrance um. And when they came out with Irish Spring, it wasn't debuted in Ireland. No one in Ireland invented it. It was actually invented in Germany in nineteen seventy and then it made its way to the United States in nineteen seventy two, and initially for the first like decade that Irish Spring was around. On the package it said a manly deodorant soap. How interesting for men. They couldn't call it German spring either, because that sounds like some kind of Nazi offensive or something. They they called the Irish Spring, but in German. Remember how it's pronounced. M hmmm, I don't remember that one. You can't put two and two together from that. No, ye, Well, I'll see if I can find it while we're still talking. Okay, So should we talk about how you should wash your hands since that's relevant? Yeah? I think so. And I know we talked about this some on the COVID episode, But um, I love the way that this doctor put it. It was a health official. I think that said wash your hands like you've been chopping jalapenos, and you need to change out your contact lenses. That's a really great advice. It was sort of like when we did this reminds me of when we did poison ivy and they said you need to scrub like there's grease, like auto black auto grease on your body. Do you remember saying that? No, I mean that that was just the advice from the poison IVY episode. Okay, but that's what I'm saying, Like, I don't remember giving that advice. I'm I'm impressed as I remember that, because you gotta get that that the poison of off your body and it's it's very greasy. I got poison ivy again the other day. Man, It's terrible. How bad. It was very concentrated in a small area I think, on my genitals, on my ankle, around my ankle, I think, but it was like um, but it was just a study and self control not to touch it. I had zero calumine lotion or anything like that that I could use. It was bad. I officially get it now, because I think when we recorded that I had not yet. Uh, I didn't think I was allergic or whatever. But I've since gotten it a couple of times, including a couple of weeks ago, just like you. Wow, not much though, just a couple of tiny little spots. Maybe yours was sympathy poison ivy maybe because I had it, you know, yeah, my genitals itched. Your genitals always itching sympathy from it? Oh? Man, I think how many times have we said that? Now? Eight? We should put in a little ding a buzzer or something. Let's see we can get Jerry to do that. All right? Hey, do you want to know what Irish spring is in German? Yeah? Irish? Sure? Freeling? Yeah, all right? How is my German great? Is that how you would say it? Irish? Er? I guess? So how's it spelled? Just Irish with an e R no I r I s c h. Yeah, yeah, that sounds about right, okay, and then freeling there's even an oom laut I love tho zoom outs. So do you want to take a break and talk about how to wash hands? Or do you want to wash hands and then take a break. Now, let's let's take that break. Okay, everybody, we'll be right back. All right, we're gonna wash our hands. We're gonna do it. You gotta wet them, you gotta start with water, gotta soap up, and then you gotta really start scrubbing, and especially now these days when they've and this is just you should just do this from now to the end of time, now that we really know how to watch hands. Uh, you know, scrub those palms, scrub the backs, getting between those fingies, getting getting those fingy nails. Uh. They say to seeing Happy Birthday a couple of times. Sure, if you know them. Um, I like to use Uh, I'd like to use really hot water just because it makes me feel like I'm getting them cleaner. It hurts me, does it really? Yeah? He's cold water? No no, no, no, I'm crazy. Um, but I do like warm water, warm towards the hot side, but definitely not hot like I wouldn't care drives it as hot? Yeah, like it's so hot it can barely stand it. Really? Oh boy? That to me, it's just a shy away from that. Uh. And here's something that I've been wanting to say for a long long time because this has been one of Emily's big uh sort of things. Is stuck in her craw? Is? I guess that's not the right things. Something stuck in your craw? No, that's not quite right, but you know what I mean, A thorn in her side? Okay, I could see both working. Is that antibacterial soap is not more effective people it's not. It's not it's not. No, And in fact, it's actually kind of harmful in the larger scheme of things. But it doesn't do anything that soap can't do. No, you're falling for some marketing gobbledegook. Stop it. And I mean it makes sense. You would think like, Okay, I'm washing my hands, but I'm also washing my hands with something that has an antibacterial agent, and so it's killing stuff. And yes, it kills some things, it's true, um, But the problem is is the stuff that it doesn't kill stays around and evolves to be resistant to those anti bio bacterial agents, right, And the problem is that those same bugs aren't just on your hands and don't just encounter soap. We use antibiotics against them, but if they've learned to be resistant from soap washing by you know, billions of people every day, um, it makes it way harder to kill them with antibiotics. And so they finally figured out that some of the antibiotic resistant bugs that we were starting to see, we're basically in training through antibacterial soap. And eventually the I think the f d A band two of the ingredients that that were commonly used in antibacterial soap. Right, Yeah, they ban tri closen and triclocarbon and said use regular soap. Everybody. The FDA said that it's not just me talking no, And I mean, it's because is it that that regular soap does all the same things that that anti bacterial soap does too? And I have to say chuck. So we're talking about handwashing. One of the things that I found astounding in all this is that so handwashing is so prevalent now, but it's not like it was anything new when the when the COVID pandemic came around, right, But apparently it's still relatively new as far as handwashing guidelines go. That wasn't until the eighties that the CDC issued their first handwashing guidelines, and that was for hospitals. Hospitals didn't have handwashing guidelines issued by the CDC until the eighties. Isn't that astounding? It is? But I wonder if that was just because they were like, uh, duh everybody, and then someone said, well, you should probably just codify it. I don't know. I saw that it was in response to some hospital acquired infection outbreaks. So maybe the CDC was like you know this right. And it turns out that hospitals like no, not really yeah, very interesting, doctors were walking around touching their genitals and doing surgery. Yeah. So here's another thing. Liquid soap versus bar soap. You would think that, and I think a lot of people may be disgusted by bar soap that other people use, especially when they're hairy. But they have done studies. They did a study in nineteen sixty five where they contaminated uh the hands of the researchers with five million bacteria and then had them wash their hands and then had other people afterward, and found that the bacteria was not transferred to the second user. Uh. This was confirmed in with another study. Uh. And what they came the conclusion they came to basically is there could be some surface bacteria on a bar soap that's just left out like that, but it definitely doesn't transmit infection. Huh. Well why wouldn't it, I don't know, because they soap. They just showed that it didn't. Huh. Yeah, they showed that it didn't transmit infection. And I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's uh the properties of the soap at work, or maybe it just doesn't live that long on on a surface like that. I could see that. I could see soap not being a very hospitable surface for microbes. But when I do pick up bar soap in the shower, like I always give it a rints off first. You get it wet, get thee get the layer of gunk off first. You know, Yeah, that's true. Um, And I think I think people probably would be grossed out if public restaurants just had a bar soapen there. But it's it's not gonna get you sick. But but I get it. You know, you have those pumps of individual soaps. I get it. It's true. Plus also usually when you encounter liquid soap um it has like other stuff in it that maybe moisturizes your hands or does your things that a bar soap might not. What's the deal with detergent so here's the thing. Most of the stuff that you have in your bathroom right now that you consider soap are actually detergents. A detergent is simply a synthetic soap. The only way for something to qualify as a soap is for it to have gone through supontification station. CRU's right past. I'm glad this came up because Uh, Emily came through when I was researching, researching, and she's like, you know, soap isn't even soap anymore. She's like, they can, they can call it soap legally, but it's not even soap. Yeah. So, so you've got your fats and you've got your um alkaline, and you put them together and they undergo supontification, and you have soap. If you don't start with fats and alkalines and they don't undergo spontification, you have something that does the same thing and in many cases is even more desire, has more desirable traits than just natural soap. But it's just not soap. It's a detergent. And the first detergents, and plenty of detergents still around today were derived from um synthetic chemicals that came from petroleum. Actually, yeah, because the deal was is once they figured out soap many many years ago, they just washed everything with soap, uh, clothes and your dishes, and they would clean floors and it was you know, it's that's not what it was made for. So it would leave a residue. It's called soap scum. And especially when it's mixed with hard water, if it's really high in mineral salt, magnesium and calcium, it's gonna make a lot of soap scum. And it was a big problem back in the old days when it would be left over on your kitchen floor or you know, big time on your washing machine. Yeah, well that was a big, big problem because washing machines came out before laundry detergent did, and it could really gum up the works when you had a soap scum layer that was hard as concrete on that's right. But detergent it's solved all that it did um because detergent doesn't leave soap scumb because it doesn't interact with calcium and magnesium in hard water, which made it vastly preferable to use for laundry, which is by the first detergents that they ever came out with were laundry detergents, and specifically, from what I saw, the first detergent was draft in, which is still around today. You can get draft really yeah, yeah, it's still very much around and in Canada it's called ivory snow because Canadians just weird with everything. I've heard of Ivory Snow didn't giving draft everything. Well, Draft came around and that handled like pretty decently soiled things, but nothing nothing too heavy. Uh And so was it the same company that went on to create Tied. I'm pretty sure it was Procter and Gamble that did Draft. Did they do Tied? To mm hmm. I want to say yes, I want to too, but I don't want to get it. Would actually go with yes, okay. Uh. The next one, yeah, the next big one in three was Tied, and that was a combination of these synthetic surfactants and something called Builders, and the Builders kind of worked in concert with the synthetic surfactants to just kind of get out tougher stains. And in nineteen forty six they brought it onto the test market as a heavy duty detergent. Everyone loved it and it's this is kind of cool, but where did you get this? Actually, this piece, I think that one was from Thought Company. And I also want to give a shout out to another Thought Company piece that was written by an historian named Judith Ridner who gave us a lot of the history stuff too well. Tide has tried to improve it a lot over the years, and has not stopped. And it says that each year they basically try and duplicate mineral content of the water in all parts of the US. Like what what? What are all the kinds of water that we have in the United States? And let's do fifty test loads with tie just to make sure we're still up to snuff. Yeah, every year, fifty thousand test loads. Imagine being the person in charge of that laundry, wouldn't you just go just totally out of it? Pretty bad? Fifty thousand. I wouldn't make it to fifty. Yeah, Undy taking a stand against laundry um. Although I have to say so. One of the things we're talking about castile soap um in addition to just being soap, it doesn't it's known to do a lot of stuff, and one of the things supposedly is laundry. So I did a test on a grease staying on some shorts with some cast steel soap, and I will report back eventually to let you know if it worked. Okay, where was treated? It on the leg? Not too far from the genitals. Now that you mentioned ding ding so um so a detergent again, it's just a synthetic a synthetic soap and it doesn't do anything differently. But the reason why companies preferred detergents is because they can control it a lot more. It's something that they create themselves. They don't have to rely on nature. They don't have to keep um a high priest on the payroll to oversee the goat sacrifices to get the tall. Oh, it's just a lot easier to control from beginning to end. Um. The problem is is a lot of times some of those stuff, some of those um synthetic detergents can be um harsh on your skin. Yeah, they can dry things out, It can be irritants for sure. If you have xema, that's that's definitely something that you might or dermatitis. And uh, Emily has had a lot of success with people that specifically use her soap because it's real soap and they had excellent skin problems and that really helped it out. Yeah. Yeah, because I mean, like even soap haz it's high on the on the pH scale, higher than natural skin pH, but it's usually much lower than say like a detergent. The thing is is modern chemistry and modern soap bank and can can adjust things as needed to make things easier on your skin for sure. Yeah, and those detergents aren't great for getting that that gray water getting into the eventual fresh water supply. It's no good for animals and fishies especially no supposedly you know how soap surfactants. Detergents are as well, which means that they break the surface tension of water, which makes it easier for for fish to um absorb all the gunk that we put in the water. Along with detergents too, so it's bad on that side. And it also stretches out and breaks through their the membrane that keeps them gooey, which is not good for fish either. It's no good fish just need to use soap. I don't know what their problem is. Get clean you and smell so fishy? Right? Have you got anything else about soap? Got nothing else? Use it? People? Wash your hands a lot, yep, wash your hands. Everybody say you're abc, say happy birthday twice, but really get a good latherer going and wash them a lot. Okay, Okay, And since we said okay a couple of times and genitals, god knows how many times, it's time for a listener to me, I'm gonna call this hot off the presses. Uh. You guys don't know this, but we are playing it dangerously close here lately with our recording schedule, too close for our comfort. So things that we're recording are coming out days later, and that means the corrections are coming just days later. So this was about the recently released Billy the kid Win. Hey, guys, love the show. It seriously keeps my work day interesting. Just listen to the ability to kids short stuff and really enjoyed it. But I thought i'd share a tidbit of info. You mentioned that Billy went to slice up a bit of yearling. Uh a k A horse meat for most coital snack. I'm from Wyoming and my family raised his horses as well as beef and show cattle. I just thought i'd share. In the livestock industry, technically almost all live stock is a yearling once they've hit a year of age, especially especially common to call younger butcher cattle yearlings. Um. And then I looked up the movie The Yearling. Remember that it's about that little baby deer. So oh, I thought that was about a horse too. I think it's about a deer or at least there's a deer on the cover. Well, that's probably about a deer. That very misleading of it. Was it either that or like the person who was in charge of the cover design didn't bother to read the book. Well, Jewel says this. While it's very possible it was a horse, because people did eat horses back then. Yearling horses have don't have much meat on them, so unless the family was really starving, it's unlikely they butcher a horse that young for dinner. More than likely, Billy was carving up a little bit of beef. Okay, that makes a little more sense. But is this from Jewel? Did you say as a Jewel? The singer, well, it's from a Jewel. I don't know if I don't think it's No, it's not because I'm looking at the last name now, Okay, I don't know what Jewel's last name is. I didn't even realize she had a last name. I want to say it's Cuture or something like that. Okay, Well, either way, she's great because I was listening to some of her old stuff not too long ago for SERI reason, yeah, and I was like, this is still really good music. Okay, Yeah, give Jewel a listen, Chuck, I think you'd be like Josh is right. Well, thank you Jewel for writing though. Yeah, thank you other Jewel for writing in And if you're the same Jewel, I'm onto you. If you want to get in touch with this, like Jewel did, you can send an email.
