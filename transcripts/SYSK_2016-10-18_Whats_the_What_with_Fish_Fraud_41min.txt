Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Jerry's to my right, different things rolling, feeling easy. So this is stuff you should know. Is that really Jerry? Is it just Jerry the tooth pitch? Perhaps we've been fooled this entire time. Yeah, I mean we'd have to do a DNA test. Yeah, Jerry, I just made air quotes. Everybody. Can we swab your mouth? I don't think we need to. Her spittle is all over this room. She spits on our microphones when we leave every day. I'm sure she does. I'm I'm I've never been more convinced of anything. Some days more than others. Uh, well that was just a little um play acting what I was all in. Jerry's a real human, She's not a toothfish. Oh yeah, but you know it is a toothfish. Yeah, Chilean sea baths. That's right, dude, We've just said that before. I feel like it was in our in the TV show, so like eight people at least heard it there. Let's see my wife your wife. Uh yeah, we for sure mentioned it on the TV show, and I feel like we've mentioned it before. Everyone knows by now, right, because that's one of those facts that people love to drop at a dinner party, like, you know, what you're eating filth. Yeah, it's delicious. Toothfish is what it is, right, you know. Yeah. But I mean if you like, if a fish is called a Patagonian toothfish, but it tastes delicious, then yeah, there's really nothing wrong with just changing the name. Correct. The problem comes when people get ripped off for paying more money for something they think it is and it's not. That is actually a surprisingly enormous problem. It turns out it's called fish fraud or seafood fraud, and there's some sheriff's on the case they're called Oceana. Yeah, they did it. They're a great organization, by the way, they're fantastic. They did this big study led by a woman named Kimberly Warner in two thousand twelve because they knew everyone knew. This was no surprise that fish are purposefully mislabeled a lot of time by well, it kind of depends. I mean, it could be the fisher person, could be the the company they worked for. It could be the people that they sell to at the docks. The wholesalers could be distributors, could be the restaurant tour or the grocer you're buying from who goes in the back and like stifles a chuckle because you just paid seven times what that fish is actually worth. I'm sure because you thought it was something else. It does happen, and so, like you said, everybody knows that this happened. But the Oceanic study was it revealed just how widespread it was. Yeah, they reported that thirty three of the fish it tested in restaurants and markets were not the fish that the fish said they were. It gets worse. That's everything they tested that was the average, right, So fully a third of all the samples, and they took like forty seven samples six hundred and many five restaurants in twenty one states across the US. They found that in sushi restaurants in particular, of the food samples were mislabeled. And if so, you say, well, seventy of sushi restaurants do that, no of samples of the sushi restaurants sold mislabeled fish. Yeah, like this isn't mackerel, it's ground beef. And a hundred percent d percent of the hammachi, the yellowtail was mislabeled. None of it was actual yellowtail. Yeah. And and just at the sushi restaurants of Hamachi. Yeah, there's a new place in Atlanta that I went to recently called Brush that I already mentioned this. It's the best sushi I've ever had, probably really and it's the most expensive shi I've ever had. It's called Brush. Yeah, where is it? It's Indicator and it's Um. I mean it's really pricey. Have you been to Umi? No, stuff, haven't been there, but like i'd be interested in compared to a single piece piece of sushi, is like twelve bucks shushi for twelve sushi sandwich, you know, yeah, that's pretty expensive sushi. Yeah, I mean we dropped for a regular meal, way too much money. But do you do when you walked out of there? This is the key. When you walked out of there, did you feel like you've gotten your money's worth? Or were you slightly irritated? No? It was It was the most delicious sushi I've ever had. Cool. But here's the deal. They just give you. I thought we talked about this. Maybe not. Um, you're confusing me with you know how their podcast. I love to over soy my sushi. That's how I like it. But they don't let you do that. They don't give you soy sauce at all. And then if you ask for it, that good. You know my views on untaste, Yeah, do it the way I say it. But if you request it, they of you a little spray bottle. Yeah, well they're serious about this tiny little spray bottle that you can spray on your things. So did you like get a cramp spraying soy sauce on your sushi? Now? I unscrewed it, and that's awesome. If I'm gonna pay two meal, sure you should be able to eat it. How you want to agree exactly. That's like, I don't know, come to a hot dog place, You're like, you really don't think you should put catchup on there, So we're not going to have that for you, you know, or they give you a spray bottle cap, it won't work, that's right. Okay, Well there's some good free buzz marketing for brush. Frankly, I think you owe us both the gift card. Yeah, but my point was you would think, I mean, there was sabby was real. You would think that they that everything was as advertised when you go to a place at night. The problem is man like they they may believe that, and the people that they bought it from me believe it. But I was reading the Sociana study and they said that I think even more than of the seafood imported in the US, and that's most of the seafoo in the US we impored, almost all of it is processed at sea. And I was like, what does that mean? And I went and searched like fish processing at sea and I found this little twelve minute like Yankee documentary about I think like Norwegian or some sort of Scandinavian fisher trawler where they start with the catch had this huge net of I'm not quite sure what kind of fish it was, but it was generally the same fish that they Um, what you didn't know what kind of fishing right right, Well, yeah, I'm getting to that. Then they dump them into like the fish sorting things, right, and then um they start processing. They have a whole processing plant in the on the boat and so by the time these guys get to shore, these things are already frozen salid in blocks, packaged in boxes. So the people who are buying it have to be like, okay, it says on the box this, I'm gonna trust you and give me, you know, half a million or a million pounds of that stuff because I'm a distributor. And if they're not truthful, the fisher people aren't truth truthful, then the whole supply line is infected and it's very tough to verify it is. Oceania has a map, by the way, if you go to their website and just google fish fraud, Oceania will go right there and they have a handy map where you can click on It's all over the world. It's not a US problem, um, and you can click on like Atlanta, Georgia. If that's where you live. And UM, what it will do is linked to UH. If they don't have a study from the restaurants, they will link to other source studies that they've compiled. And there was one that was a link to UH. A j c our newspaper or had an article about local restaurants. You know, when they do that, the expose a thing. We visited eight local restaurants and they called them out by name. And of course these people are like, well, I didn't know, right, So and I think a lot of times they probably don't know. I would guess probably most of the time they don't know. Yeah, you know. I mean if you're if you're dealing directly with the end consumer, you're you're probably going to be less likely to engage in fraud, you know. Um. And if this sounds like a not big deal, it's a billion dollar fraud and dollars annually in fraud in America alone, Yeah, just the United States, that's right. So yeah. And the reason why it's billion dollars worth of frauds because we spend a lot of money on seafood. Um it's good for you, right, And the number one driver of UM seafood fraud is misrepresenting something like as an expensive fish in replacing it with the fish that's much less expensive. That's kind of the nuts and bolts of it. The FDA does have laws, UM, but the problem is one of the problem UH problems is less than one percent of all the fish that are in ordered, less than one percent is inspected. So one percent of all the fish and seafood eaten in the United States is inspective for fraud. Yeah, and the and the ten percent. I mean, one of the tips that will give you later I'll go ahead and say now is if you buy local fish or fish from the United States, you're far less likely to be UH frauded defrauded. Yeah, defrauded, which doesn't make any sense. It's like inflammable. Yeah. But um, apparently the US internally does a pretty good job keeping it above board, but like you said, comes from elsewhere. So that's the issue and one of the reasons why it's um that the f D a UM or the United States I should say, the federal government has so much trouble inspecting imported fish because there's apparently like ninety agents tasked with inspecting all of the fish that's imported into the United States. Yeah, inty people. Yeah, and that's the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in o a A. Noah is who's doing this. Um, And they're doing the best they can. But ninety people. It's like I didn't get numbers on how much of our imported fishes, but I mean it's got to be like foounds maybe maybe even up to a thousand, so there's no way they can test all these fish. Um. What's funny in the Sociana UM study, and I should say this is from two twelve. I think this made the news several years ago and we're bringing it back. Um, they're they're the worst offenders as far as seafood frog go. We're Thailand and Vietnam. But Canada was mentioned in there. What Yeah, oh Canada. I know that's what I say to Yeah, they apparently don't have nearly as stringent aquaculture laws as we do in the US. I know that's what I said too. There are such nice people, though I would have thought would be the opposite, you know, Yeah, maybe that's what it is. Maybe they're like, we don't need laws. Of course, we're not going to defraud. You were Canadians and maybe it's just a mistake. They're like looks like a god to me, a you know, like they're not intentionally defrauding people, because Canadians don't do that. Uh. All right, well let's take a break and we're gonna talk about, um kind of how this is done right after this. All right, So I promised to tell you how this is done. Um. One of the big ways and reasons this can happen is that a lot of the time him these fake fish, they're real fish, fraudulent fish, unless it's that fake crab stuff, right, which is still fish. Oh yeah it is, isn't it. It's like white fish in it. Um, it's like string cheese crab. It's still delicious. I love it. Do you like it? I'm not big on it, yeah, I mean, of course I always prefer the real thing. I had too much when I was a kid. I think. Yeah, I do a pretty good uh kind of red nicky crab dip with it. Oh yeah, it's just delicious, just like mayonnaise and what's the shirt and stuff? It is good. Uh. I will say this is like as red nicky as it is when I have it at places like parties, People like it's like crack. Even high society types, Yep, they can't get enough of it. They're like, what's in this? And I go Duke's mayonnaise and fake crab what? Alright? So what was pop out they do? Oh? Yeah. The reason why this happens is a lot of these fraudulent fish are they come to you as filet's. They don't have the head in the tail and the skin and all those things, and you can't or maybe the skin, but people don't know this. Really. This goes to that um processing, right, So, like these guys just dumped a net full of fish down these shoots, and the first thing they did was the things went um perpendicular down a conveyor belt, right, So rather than facing the direction that the conveyor conveyor belt was going, they were perpendicular in that direction. And it just so happened that along that conveyor belt was a big circular saw that was exactly where their head was placed. So it just cuts their heads right off, right, You can identify that fish very easily. Then it goes into the body splitter and gutter, then the fil ayer and seriously, I was watching this, I'm like, that is that the same kind of fish, and yet they were ending up in the same like batch of fish that was being sold in package together. So I was looking around to see, like, who's keeping up with this? And again at sea, nobody's keeping up with it. Of course not right. So like in the United States and in other countries, there are people who, um, who are overseeing this stuff, and sorting fish is a it's a big deal, but it's also a pain, right, because if you get what's called bycatch in your in your in your catch, yeah, in your nets, like you don't if you're if you're shopping for tuna, you don't want dolphin, you know, if you're fishing for tuna and you and you hauling a big net, like you're gonna have all kinds of stuff in there. Yeah. And apparently we read this little Mother Jones article two. Did you read that? So? Um, Apparently this is a fairly recent phenomenon by catch, right, because in like the sixties or seventies, they started using much longer line, so they were catching much deeper fish, and they were also by catching fish that they didn't normally catch before, including the Patagonian toothfish. So these guys are bringing up so much bycatch, and it's such a pain to just sort this stuff and then basically throw it away. They're like, we should rename this thing and like create a market for it. So they did. So they renamed Patagonian toothfish Chilean sea bass, and all of a sudden, there's a big market for it. The irony is now they're over fishing Chilean sea baths Patagonian toothfish. They need to change the name back again. Uh all right, well, here's here's a list, and we're gonna get to that other. I know, if you tease someone with something like exlex fish, it's always good to come back to that. But we will list out a few of the things that are most often substituted. Um Pacific cod or Alaskan cod. Um. A lot of times you're gonna be getting Asian catfish, or maybe a thread fan slickhead, or maybe even silapia thread finn slickheads or a diamond dozen. Uh, Pacific alibu, you might get Atlantic alibu, Atlantic cod, you might get Pacific cod. Yeah. Groupers a big one. Yeah. Groupers apparently the most swapped out fish, the most fraudulent fish of all I think because the markup is so great. The markup is great, but also because the FDA is doing some weird stuff. So the FDA determines what's food in America, and there's like species of fish that qualify as food that marketable food. Right, grouper. There's something like sixties six species and twelve different geni um of fish that can be sold as just grouper in America. So not only is it expensive, but it's also um. There's a lot of confusion, so most most restaurateurs won't be like, well, that's that's not grouper, that's um um Asian catfish. Yeah. They'd be like, well that's the type of grouper, Okay, but it's not in that case. Yeah, but yeah, you're right, it's it's it's there are that many kinds of one fish. It's probably hard to regulate, harder to regulate, and I think the market they said it's like four times if you are if you're selling Asian catfish, it's gonna be a four times markup for grouper. Right, So if you're impoverished fisher person, you'll say, yeah, maybe this ship man grouper, red snapper, Right, you want to see if you see like a box with grouper and a question markt be wary of that one red snapper. Be aware you might be eating crimson snapper instead. That's a big, big problem. Or tilapia. Yeah, and then salmon, of course there there's a wide range of salmon and a wide range of prices according to what kind of salmon it is. And it's all farmed Atlantic salmon, well it could be for apparently that's ah, that's what they switch all of them out with. Like, if you think you're getting a Copper River salmon, it's probably Copper River salmon because that's here in the US. Sure, But if you think, oh, look at that that ski over there, it's beautiful, don't don't see his face, but it's probably Atlantic salmon. Yeah. And at first I was like, I don't understand how they could swap out salmon because it's so just distinctive. But now I get it, because you think it's like a wild caught Alaskan salmon, and it's it was, you know, farmed in some guy's backyard in Louisiana, you know. And I was looking to see what the difference is between wild caught and farmed fish Apparently for every pro on one side, there's a con as well, And if you kind of go down the list, they pretty much even out one another. Um. A lot of the old unsustainable practices like get this, so to feed fish, they will go out and catch smaller fish and then feed the smaller fish to the bigger fish, which is stupid because you're going and getting all of the babies from fish nurseries that and they won't grow up any longer. They figured out that you can feed them a combination of worms and algae and that has basically the same amount of nutrients, but it's what more too expensive or not as easy or something, I don't know, I don't know. But similarly, right um, they're like, well, you know, there's a lot of runoff and farms and stuff that that can pollute the fishery. Um, but the same thing can be true for like actual like wild coots fish as well. So there's like this weird give and take, and they seem to totally equal out. Yeah, So as far as the most mislabeled in the oceanic study, at least of snapper samples that they found were mislabeled, and that was the number one mislabeled fish. In their study that year, tuna was number two. It's fifty nine. That's that's like close to the tuna almost there. Yeah, and white tuna is is a big reason why. Um, we've all probably had albacore delicious albacore. Um. And white tuna is not even a fish. So if you go to anywhere but a sushi place, it says white tuna. UM, say like, well that's not a fish. What is this would be like, it's white tuna. Stop asking questions. Yeah, they'll take your soy sauce away, give you mustard instead of a sabi in a bottle. Um. But yeah, it's not even a real fish. So um uh esclar is the fish that we've been teasing this whole time, the ex lax fish. Yes, and I love this fish. I do too. I didn't realize it was that I've eaten it his butterfish many a time. Yeah. What are the other names for it? Butterfish, um, white tuna, Hawaiian wallo. Yeah, that's it. That's very misleading. Rudder fish. Rudder fish sounds inedible itself. You know, sure, I wouldn't need a rudder fish. I'd be like get this off the menu. I think Escolar sounds like very fancy. Yeah, like it makes your pinky go up when you say it, you know, yeah, like Escalar, Yeah, because it sounds like Escobar. And he was the best drug king pin of all time. Sure, yeah, he was the fancy drug king But I guess Escalar. People know it's a dirty little secret, which is that there is an oil, uh this wax esther that makes it taste delicious and it's not digestible by us. So if you eat more like in little tiny sushi portions, it's it's okay, but if you get enough of it, you're gonna have the poopy pants by enough of it, like a filet can do it supply? Probably? Yeah, Like anal seepage apparently is the result of eating this stuff. Yeah, say I didn't he didn't know. I did. People need to be informed. Uh Yeah. So what happened was, um people started blue fin tuna, as everyone knows, is very expensive now because there's not as much of it. So vy blue fin tuna was about fourteen cents a pound on the wholesale market, and UM it varies now. In two thousand and fifteen it was eight to twelve bucks a pound, and in two thousand and fourteen it was actually higher, it was ten to fifteen dollars a pound. That's why you see these crazy reports like a fisherman catches a tuna worth like ten thousand dollars or more, you know, because it's like hundreds and hundreds of pounds. Uh if you get a big one. And um, so, like you said, they started going deeper and that's when they started getting this bycatch. And apparently esclar dwell on the bottom because they're poopy fish. They're called a snake mackerel. That's a good name. I need a snake mackerel. Would you sure that made you poop your pants? That gave you anal seepage? Well, it doesn't say that on the menu, although since I mentioned that, Uh. In two thousand four the state of Washington, Uh, they issued a bulletin on it, and they have I think some restaurants at least in the European Union like say on the packaging it can cause poopy pants. Right, there's a picture of a guy holding the seat of his pants in alarm with the universal symbol snake mackerel coming out of his butt, smoking a cigar. Oh boy, it is outright banded in Japan and Italy, so I love it. In Japan, you know, they're they're like, no, don't mess with our sushi. But people stand by it. There's um, I mean chef Eric Prepair, they mentioned this article like world renowned chef. He's he loves his stuff. Well, yeah, it cleans him out. But I guess you just don't serve it like too much. He's like, you go spend a weekend in a chili cook off, pounds of escal are on Sunday night and escalar shake growth. You have had it before, right, Yeah, butterfish is the perfect name. It's really delicious. It is amazing. Yeah, but yeah, apparently gets you. And for the part of the U s f D a um, they said that they request manufacturers informed buyers about the purgative effect toothless toothfishless. Yeah, should we take a break. Let's take a break, and then we'll come back and talk about why this actually matters and uh, how to combat this? So chuck, we we mentioned like the big thing billion dollars worth of losses or I guess rip offs in the United States alone every year, right, So that's I mean that's the basis of why people fight fish fraud. Somebody's getting ripped off, whether it's you, whether it's the restaurant tour you're buying from, whether it's just the distributor, whether it's all of you combined, you're getting ripped off and that's not cool. Well, yeah, because like we said, if if you like the taste of the fish, just call it that fish, the market price appropriately and maybe that price will go up naturally. Well, that's what happened I think with the Chilean sea bass. Yeah, I mean they renamed it, but it was it wasn't fraud necessarily. No demand drove the price up, you know, No, No, that wasn't That was just marketing. Yeah, but the demand was driven by the barn Asian marketing practics, you know. No, agreed, they weren't committing fraud, correct, they were just committing pr you know, good one. So being ripped off is a big one. There's also health concerns too. In addition to anal seepage, there are plenty of other things that can happen to you if you eat fish that is different from the fish that you're thinking you're eating. All kinds of seepage. All right, I see pitch gum seepage. I know. But people are allergic to certain kinds of fish. Um, so you might not know that you're eating something that's horrible to you'd be like, this is wah, who I thought it was telapia? Good one. Huh. Telappi is one of those. It's very much under fire for the farm raised practices, oh, because it's not very well raised. Yeah. I don't know exactly the deal, but I know that telappi is a very controversial fish to buy right now here in the US or out out of I think in the US, because everything I saw said like, fisheries used to be farm raised. Fisheries used to be um nasty in the US, but the Americans have really cleaned up our act lately. Yeah, I'll have to look it up. They there are plenty of articles called like the problem with telapia and stuff like that. And they don't call it the rat of the sea for nothing, do they? You just made it up? So uh. One of the other big problems is that fish are always being monitored for being over fished, and so if you don't know what's being sold and eaten, you can't get accurate numbers on what you're trying to protect. You might be eating an endangered fish. You might even be one of those people that carries a little card AOU in your wallet that says, you know, eat these responsible fish or I guess they're not responsible fish. Maybe they are responsibly my home that they provide for. Uh. But yeah, you might be eating something. You might be eating something that is seriously endangered and you don't even know. Yeah, And this article I think makes a pretty good point that, Um, there's a like, if you're pushing to save a fish species from being fish to extinction, you usually need public sentiment behind you in those in those cases right to be effective. Um, but if the public is out there like dude, I'm seeing snapper everywhere. Everybody's got snapper. It's not endangered, you hippie, go home, then your your your public relations thing is going to fail. Yeah. So that's another kind of indirect problem of easily overlooked problem, the perception that fish are healthier. Fish stocks are healthier than they actually are. Apparently the blue fin tuna stocks are going up a bit, which is good news. Yeah, that was that good thing about the bycatch like starting to market bycatch that it like took the pressure off of the original target fish that they were going after. So what can you do? They suggest buying whole fish. If you're not creeped out by that, um, you don't mind looking those little fellas in the eyeballs, then dead eyes by the whole fish, because it's much easier to tell what kind of fishes when it has a face. The thing is that's you have to know what a fish looks like. Then yeah, or have a computer hookup an internet connection. Are sure you know? But I mean, are you gonna take the fish home, look it up and then take it back and be like, this doesn't match the picture. No, you take out your phone in the store, google red snapper and if you think that guy doesn't look like a red snapper, or you know what, I bet there's an app or there should be an app called fish watch where you can take a picture of the fish in the store and then really annoy the fishmonger at your local market, challenging them with your app. When you catch them in the active fraud, you go fish watch, spin and run off. The other thing they say you can do is, uh, if you go to a restaurant and you want to pretend like you're in a Portlandia Sketch asks them about where the fish was caught or raised, how it was raised, how it was caught, what kind of nets were used, what area the ocean. What's the name of the man who cut its head off? Yeah, they say that's a legitimate thing you can do. Do you remember that song fish heads, fish heads, fish heads? Yeah? Heads? Which what was that? Do you too? It was like this duo and I can't remember their names, but one of the duo, one half of the duo was Little Will Robinson from um uh uh what's the name of that space? Yeah? I think I went down a internet rabbit hole on that song one time. It's a great song, but it wasn't it just like it's sort of in the new wave era. It's like late seventies, early eighties. It was um with a residence then Yeah, yeah, than anything than new wave? You know. Interesting? Did you ever see that episode of Chips where they basically spend the whole episode trying to explain the difference between punk rockers who are criminals and new waivers who are just there to have fun. Good Yeah, maybe you know the actor William forsythe sure. He plays a punk with like a green mohawk, who like, I think he's taken pot shots of people on the highway, like an embankment with his rifle. Yeah, because you know punks are snipers in the weight. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty funny. And then punches trying to date this new wave girl who's explaining to him the difference. It's a good, good episode. As as usual with Chips, there was some angle with punch in the lady. Yeah, hey, I think you're kind of freaky, but let's state I told you I worked with him one time, right, and he kept arresting people. Well he would that would. I asked him if he would arrest me for a photo and he was like, yeah, sure, put me up against the car, Like why are your handcuffs fuzzy? He very much enjoyed being punched though. He was into it, Like all the ladies came out in the neighborhood still and they're like Erica Strata. He's like that's right, right, and his hair quivered. He's like, do we have any punk or new Waivers in the neighborhood. You gotta see that up man, it's good. That was a great show. Maybe the best theme song of all time too, that's pretty good. Didn't we try to model our own TV show theme song after that? But then didn't? Wasn't that the original idea? It was like to make it like Chips. Oh no, it was a different show. What was it? It was like it was supposed to be like a takeoff and one of the one of the great legendary TV shows openings. I don't remember what it was, but we did do the liver and up and down thing, but I don't remember what it was. Maybe Chad can tell us. We failed on so many levels there, it's pretty remarkable. Um, Chad's the director of the show, by the way, case you don't know Chad. Uh So. There was a task force that President Obama put together in December of last year that UM and I always wonder about these when they say things like I'm going to call for better international cooperation and collaboration, right, Like, I know there are more details to that that probably make it seem like it has teeth, But when you hear that, it kind of feels like, is that really going to do anything? Like when Rubber meets the road and these people are out there fishing in the deep ocean. Like always said, we needed to cooperate and collaborate, So let's do it, you know, like enforcement is what we need. Well, there's these guys who are trying to get the enforcement end down chuck down at the University of South Florida. They've come up with, basically, um, a little module called grouper Check. Yeah. Their names are John Paul and Robert Ulric, which I wanted to be Robert yuruck so bad. I kept thinking, wasn't that the guy's name, but I was mixing up Skeet uld Rich with Robert. This is the second career. Yeah, it might be the same person for all I know. But apparently this little thing looks like an external hard drive plugged into a laptop a module and it can tests four samples at a time, even if they have sauce on them already, and it takes uh, which means that you're sitting at the table running a test, a DNA test on your dinner. Yeah, that's what you do. You go in the restaurant and slip it. That's what this that That woman who led the Oceana study says that she there was a great Atlantic article. She seens that sneak in. She goes into restaurants with little zip blocks and you know, just puts a little bits of ficient there. But the people who are with like, you don't have to put in your mouth first, spit it out and just put it in the bag directly. So the grouper check machine UM works in forty five minutes, which is the only thing it checks for is whether it's a grouper. It goes ding it's grouper, and then you go, oh, no, my grouper is cold. Yeah, exactly, fish stew. That's your answer there, UM. But they are working on many other types of checkers for other types of fish. UM. The big problem with DNA sequencing is it takes at least twelve hours two uh to do it, you know, through DNA. So it's just not happening. No one's DNA sequencing for twelve hours on all these ships all over the world. Like fish fraud. I don't I don't see how they can fix it. Get it down to forty five minutes, get them in the hands of inspectors and more inspectors. We're gonna bust you, buddy. Yeah, in a Canadian fraudulent fish guy. Is that the idea is that fear will be stricken into the hearts of these fisher people. I think so, and that they will say, you know them fisher people scared really easy. Yeah, that's true. I've seen jaws right, they buckle at the first sign of trouble. That's anything else. No, I'm good man, that was fish fraud. Yeah, and shout out to that great article in The Atlantic appropriately. Yeah, and check out the bait and switch I think. Yeah, that's very clever title. Yeah, check out that Oceana map to um and go to go to your city and they will have some compiled studies from all over the world. And you can avoid those restaurants if you want, right, or support it if you want. You're like, I love fish fraud. That's it. If you want to know more about fish fraud, type those words in the search part how stuff works dot com. I said fraud. It's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this hunting response. Remember we talked about hunting and what was it? Polar bears and we don't get it. But I certainly knew that there would be some good arguments from some of the back to nature, folks, back to nature featuring guns. Hey guys. Grew up in suburbia and moved to the big city for college and finally had the opportunity to move out to the sticks again when my wife finished grad school and took a job. We were committed to getting back to nature living more simply, so we raised pigs and chickens for meat and eggs in every autumni hunt for deer and elk. Going on my fourth year here and this is in Montana, by the way, Uh, the meat I hunt is organic and free range. It lived one to three years as a wild animal rather than in a cramped pin with a dung matted floor. I was eliminated by a predator, albeit with the help of a rifle. But after pulling a trigger, it will stop breathing within two minutes. Uh. This is an extremely quick death for a prey animal that may otherwise be bled to death or jumped by a pack of coyotes. The winter will kill off many of these animals anyway via the cold, starvation, disease or infection, and the hunting license that allows me to take an animal indicates a gender and species, so the fish and game can manage herd numbers. Fawns and pregnant animals are never taken, most often young males are as they will have the least impact on her population. Uh. It is a difficult thing to do to pull the trigger to get the shakes every time. Still, but I'm satisfied that my family will have a healthy and natural meat for dinner for the winter, and grateful to the animal that provided it. I suppose I could just go down to my local mega mart and by the sterile white package from behind the glass. That just doesn't feel right to me anymore. That is from Jason for Montana, And those are very good points Jason. Although you could argue that he could just wait until winter comes and go collect the dead bodies of the the deer and elk. I don't know that it works that way. I mean, they gotta fall over somewhere right then everybody wins. Blame it on mother nature. You just happened to be there when they fell over.
