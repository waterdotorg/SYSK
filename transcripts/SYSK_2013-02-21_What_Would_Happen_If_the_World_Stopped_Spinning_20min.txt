Josh: Brought to you by Toyota. Let's go places. Welcome to stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Chipper and Cheery Chuck. Chucker's Bryant right across from me. How are you doing? I'm good man. I'm about to go get that jar of moonshine for my cubicle. And we've never done a show where we just drank moonshine the whole time. I think we should. What better day? I don't think it's at my desk at home? Oh? Really, do you have beers still? Or there may be some other there? I don't know what about. Well, there's a case of beer that some other dude sent me, like not it wasn't show related, but it's been sitting there for like a year. What shiner back? Oh? I got some too, And then there's a couple of beers from like England, and then there may be some moonshine. So let's just get drunk. Okay, So you're feeling good, I'm just getting folks, we're gonna do that, is what you're saying. Um, Well, my intro is, uh, you've already pood pooed it. Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that. Oh, I don't feel bad. It's pretty much part for the course, buddy, Are you ready, Chuck? Uh? Many many years ago, roughly around four eight billion years ago, um, the Earth really started to forming together from a bunch of dust and rocks and other dust, so says you, because right, because the universe was spinning, right, and all these particles were spinning, and as they came together, forming an accretion from an incretion disk, they formed the Earth and all other planets obviously, right, and all of that spin. Thanks to the laws of thermodynamics, one of them, uh, continued to spin and actually accumulated, and so the Earth just's spinning. That's why it's spinning, because it's always been spinning and all of its particles that make it up have been spinning. So it's spinning because of the conservation of angular momentum. Right. Yeah. In Newton's first law of motion, of course, that's what it was. Not thermodynamics. There is a law of motion, which is what if an object uh, an object in motion will remain in that state of motion unless basically someone comes along and puts the brakes on it. Right, unless something acts upon it, exactly, and in the vacuum of space, there's nothing to act upon it to slow the Earth down. So it's just gonna keep going. And actually the Earth has slowed in its older age. Four million years ago, a day uh lasted twenty two hours. Yeah, it's been slowing consistently over time, right, Yeah, but it's gonna take a while to stop. I think in four hundred million years in the future, they think that the day will be twenty six hours, so to two years. Slowing by two or two hours a day over four million years, it's not it's not quick. Well, in four million years, is there going to be any Earth? I don't know. That's such a good question. What will we look like. I don't think it's me It's four million years, that's my guess. Um. Okay, so the Earth is slowing. We understand why it's spinning. We understand that it is slowing down. But what happens if somebody just comes along just stops it automatically, like just stopped poop stopped. Well, and by the way, Jerry, that wasn't an edit. Yeah, that's our signal when we beep, that is a call out to Jerry. So we're moving very fast, like faster than the speed of sound, even though it didn't feel like it. Um So if someone stopped it, those same things that would happen if you just stopped your car all of a sudden, or a train stopped all of a sudden, would happen here on Earth, except it would be much more drastic because we're spinning much faster. We're spinning in an easterly direction at about a thousand miles an hour along the equator. So yeah, if all of a sudden you stop the Earth, everything that's unattached to the Earth would keep going eastward about a thousand miles an hour, mass, instantly dead, massive flooding, you name it, the wind, shock waves, buildings, everything just go. And you said something that I find kind of interesting, like when I when I when I started to research like the Earth's rotation, It's one of those things where I just assume I know what I'm talking about, and then the more I looked into I was like, oh, yeah, there's a lot of little stuff here, like questions like why don't we feel the fact that we're moving through space at about a thousand miles an hour and well, I found the answer because the Earth moves at a constant speed, the constant rate of rotation. There's no acceleration or deceleration, which we would feel if that happened. Right, Why don't we spin off the Earth? Do you know why? I do? Okay? Here? Because of gravity and the gravitational poll like, we we want to spin off the Earth. That's you know, that's in there. But the force of gravity, or the force that wants to spin us off the Earth is point three the force of gravity, right, centrifugal force weigh much more gravity going on than there is uh the other So and I found that if the Earth rotated at a rate of eighty minutes, right, it's spun around on its axis one full time, So one day was eighty minutes long. That would be fast enough to overcome the force of gravity, would be thrown off into space. But we're not going anywhere because that the Earth is never gonna start speeding up like that. That's just crazy talk. No, And it's not gonna stop spinning either anytime soon. But we can still have fun with this topic. So, say that we were existing right now as the Earth was really starting to slow down, was making its last turn. So it did it gradually like Superman style, right, and then, um, the ecosystems were intact. Everything was generally intact the moment the Earth stopped spinning the day the Earth stood still exactly. Yeah, there would be some really interesting things that happened, like a lot of are the geography of this planet. I took for granted until I read this article, which really opened my eyes. So what what what? What are some of the things that would happen if they're just stop spinning. Uh? Well, seismologists think that it would set off a massive chain of super earthquakes because they suspect that UM, the rotation the Earth, plays a big role in the movement of the tectonic plates. So they seismologists think that you know, we would all be dead because of massive, massive earthquakes. Okay, we'd probably be dead for a lot more reasons which we can explore, but yes, diverse. Yeah, because think about it, that that spinning Earth, the centrivigal force of the Earth um is so strong that um it it basically keeps the oceans in place. It creates a bulge around the equator, Like the Earth is not a perfect sphere. Um it's bulged at the middle, and it's that's because of its spin, and that bulge actually brings the world's oceans towards the equator. In the southern hemisphere they moved north. In the northern hemisphere, they moved south. But it's being pulled towards the middle of the Earth. There's spare tire. So if it stops spinning all of a sudden, the world's oceans would go towards the poles. Yeah, like quickly. It would be pretty cool to see, I guess not if you're at the poles. Did you see a map of what it would look like. Yeah, like basically a supercontinent in the center on both sides of the equator. Yeah, like all the way around the globe, and two big oceans, one on top and one on the bottom. Yeah, and the one on the top of the Arctic would actually be about a thousand meters deeper, not because there'd be more water there, but because the Antarctic basin is bigger deeper. That makes sense, so the water would be shallower by comparison. But yeah, I was looking so like Chicago would be just under the north shore of the Northern Hemisphere's ocean. Um and from that point down the United States would be largely intact. All the way into the Caribbean South it would just be land. It's pretty neat, good looking map. I love freaky weird maps. Yeah, like the early maps. Those were a little weird. There's a blog called um unusual Maps, I think maps. I can't remember what's called, but it's just like this blog about strange maps. It's pretty neat. I used to collect maps, Oh yeah, yeah, I mean I didn't have a ton. I had like fifteen or sixteen like cool map posters. Nice to still have a few of them, but I think they went the way of the Dodo in my house where they like scholastic foldouts. No, like you know, some were like you know, civil War map or the Earth at this point map, or you know, just very none of them. We're just straight up. I think I had one straight up map. Um, so what else would happen once that? What happened is the uh? And Robert Lamb wrote this, didn't he No, Jonathan at a berry? That's right, at a berry at a berry. Good job. He says that it will take a whole year to pull off what the Earth does in a day, so one part of the world would be a blazing, scorching desert, and then one part of the Earth would be a barren, frozen wasteland half a year, half half the year. And that's because the since the Earth rotates on its access in about twenty four hours a little under, I think, um, if it stopped doing that, it would still move around the Sun, it just wouldn't spin on its axis. So I figured this out. If you're having trouble visualizing it, like I did, put your thumb in front of your face out a little bit so that your thumbnail is facing you, and then pretend that the Sun is in between you and your thumb, and your thumb is the Earth, and you just rotated around so that your thumbnails facing you all the time. But it's going around the Sun, and you'll see that at any given point, right, it's the this part of the Earth is facing a different part of the sun the thumbnail. So there would be seasons, but there'd be four seasons, and they would be very different. The line demarcating them would be really different. And when you went from winter to summer, eventually you would have nothing but sunlight and then nothing but dark, depending on the temperature swing would be huge. So what that means is, um, we'd probably have a really difficult time propagating with with husbandry in general. And you don't mean sex, you're talking with plants and animals. I'm not sure what you mean. They're propagating with husbandry sounded like a euphemism. No, just farming and animals. All that would be more difficult, if not impossible, Um to grow crops, you know, for or you know, maybe you grow them during the sunny parts of the year. What you can grow and then store. But we'd be in bad shape. I think we've very bad as far as that goes. But botanically speaking, we are a pretty uh, pretty quick witted species, so we could possibly overcome it technologically maybe you know, I'll bet we'd have a really good sunglasses. Yeah, yeah, that's true and coats. Um what else would happen anything? Uh, Well, the magnetic field, well gravity, I got something on gravity here. Gravity would be changed, which is not in the article, but um, it would change significantly if it stopped spinning because uh, centrogal force of course, what you're talking about contributes to that gravitational field, and it wouldn't exist any longer, so the gravitational fiel would be strongest at the poles instead of at the equator, and who knows what that would do. You'd just be a lot heavier at the poles, right you think, maybe, Okay, we'd also lose a very interesting thing called the Coriolis effect. Yeah, my favorite, which you know, um, supposedly with the Coriolis effect, if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, if you flush the toilet, the water goes down the drain clockwise and in the Northern Hemisphere county clockwise. That it's not true. It's all plumbing, it's all the design of the drain, the Coriolis effected. There has nothing to do with what part of the Earth you're in. It's no, it has nothing to do with like the drain, the supposedly the Coreolis effect, the fact that the Earth is spinning faster at the equator than it is at the poles. Uh. It has long been tapped as a reason for whirlpooles. They're saying, No, that's probably if it's if you're talking about a drain, it's the angle of the drain, it's the design of the drain, it's the water rushing in when you flush the toilet has nothing. That's an old wives tale. But there's a coreal Coreoles effect. It's just not quite as interesting. Basically, it says that if you leave the north pole and fly toward the equator towards a certain market the equator, if you're going a straight line, you're gonna miss your mark because there are spinning and it's spinning faster at the equator than it is at the pole Coreoli. It's a curve like a Yeah, you have to basically correct longitudinally, okay um to hit your target. Like you just can't find a straight line from the north pole of the equator if you're trying to get to a certain spot. That's the Coriolis effect. Nice, I guess unless I'm missing something. It seems kind of basic. Uh yeah, that's kind of basic once you wrap your head around it. Uh. There are some things that are slowing the earth down. Like you said, the days are longer now than they used to be. Uh, yes, they used to be what twenty two hours you said fion years ago? Yeah, okay, um, so we are slowing down. There is uh tidal friction and the tide drags two point three milliseconds on each century every hundred years. So that's pretty slow, right, But it adds up over time, surely, of course it does. Um weather can affect it. Two wins can actually slow it down. Earthquakes can redistribute the mass and actually speed up. Didn't it speed up in the earthquake in Japan? Yeah? I think by um one point eight microseconds that the Earth's day, it's solar day, was accelerated because that earthquake was so massive. Nothing we could notice. What about magnetic field though, That's okay, so what I don't fully get. So with the magnetic field there, we're not quite sure why Earth or how Earth has a magnetic field. But the prevailing theory is that because of this coreolis effect in the center of the earth, um whirlpools are created of molten iron, and as this molten iron kind of moves around informs these world pools that actually generates an electrical field, an electrical current, which in turn generates a magnetic field. So we have this magnetic field. We think that's how we have it. But we also have long suspected that the magnetic field protects the Earth from solar winds, which are positively charged ions from the Sun that travel about a million miles an hour off of the Sun toward us, and they're about a million degrees celsius. And we long thought that it protected our atmosphere from be stripped of the ions that we need. Then we started looking at other planets and um that don't have any magnetic field, because I think it's just the Earth and the Sun in our solar system are the only ones with magnetic fields. UM. And we found that they lose ions at about the same rate that our atmosphere loses ions. So we don't know what the magnetic field is doing. But I did come across this one interesting fact. We lose about a ton of atmosphere a day, really yep, and and mostly in the form of water vapor. So the Earth is drying out very slowly. Wow. Ye boys, So we're slowing down, We're drying out, and in four million years will all be toasted. Yeah. That's pretty much the long and short of this. And what what We did a podcast on what would the Earth look like in different inter roles in the future, and I think we eventually landed on ultimately destruction and if we're even here any longer. Yeah, exactly. We'll use the Earth up. It's probably where we landed. Yeah, I think you're right. Well, good going, Chuck. Let's hear for Chuck everybody. UM, do you have anything else? I do not, sir. If you want to learn more about the Earth standing still, go to how stuff works dot com and type in earth um and it will bring up some pretty cool articles and probably an entire channel. There's Earth science just fascinates me. Yeah, me too, I said, search bars somewhere in there, which means it's time for a listener mail. Uh. You know you called out for how we helped you in your life emails. We got one from Rachel in Portland, Portland. Um, you guys, Uh, you guys have helped me through some of the toughest times in my life. I've shortened the beginning and August I moved from a small town in Mississippi to attend the University of Portland in Oregon. The transition was rough, Needless to say, I did not handle it well. I started smoking again, I had trouble focusing on in attending classes, and I could tell that I wasn't settling well or making friends. On top of all that, my three year relationship with my high school sweetheart fell apart because at the distance and stress of us both beginning university. I began to relapse into depression, something I've struggled with off and on for five years. Found myself unable to listen to music, even because every song I heard made me so sad, A one of those heartbreak dates when you just sit around and like listen to the radio and cry. I downloaded your podcast to listen to as I walked to and front classes, and while I did homework. Didn't notice at first, but every time your podcast was on it made me laugh. I'd feel a little bit better. About halfway through the semester, I found the courage to seek help and visit the campus health center for therapy and antidepressants. I am now my second semester of college with a three point nine for g p A. I have a few great friends, and I'm even dating someone new. I love my school and I love the city of Portland. I feel as if your podcast servan integral part of helping me make the transition from home to here. I've learned and laugh with y'all, and now and then a southern draw will sneak into one of your voices and make me nostalgic with this out. It may sound silly, but I feel I'll come to know you guys. I really want to thank you for helping me through such a hard time. Rachel eighteen in Portland. Thanks Rachel, it's awesome. I'm glad to hear you're doing better. Yeah. I had a rough first few weeks of college. I think a lot of people do. And uh, I think my advice is to just stick it out and before you know it, you're gonna be loving it. I remember my parents telling me that when I went off the camp, oh yeah, even like camp. I did not like camp. Did you like going off the college? Yeah, that's fine, you're probably ready with that. Yeah, I was. I freaked out because I at the last minute, I tried to change to go to Georgia Tech because my brother was there, and I was basically scared. I was like, I just want to go to school with my brother, and uh it didn't Uh it was too late to get the application in and so I was like, all right, I guess I'm going to Georgia by myself. And uh it ended up being the greatest thing ever. But I'm glad stuck it out, you know the rest of the story. Yeah, it is true. I mean, like, you know, just hanging in there and being brave, even when it feels like that's the worst thing to do. Often it's it's often the best thing to do. And six years later and I had a college diploma and a lot of friends for life. It's good, chuckers. Uh, let's see. If you have a great story about solar wind or how we've helped you or call ite or whatever we want to hear about it, you can find us on Twitter right s y SK podcast. I feel like a lot of you aren't getting that s y SK podcast. It's a great Twitter feed. Yeah, Josh is the Twitter master. We have a great Facebook page that Chuck helms Facebook dot com slash stuff. You should know. People love that. You can send us an email, which is fine. Uh. That's Stuff Podcast at Discovery dot com and everybody, seriously, stop what you're doing right now. Go to the home of Josh and Chuck on the web. It's our very own website. It's fun. It's called stuff. You should oh dot com for more on this and thousands of other topics. Because it how stuff works.
