Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chucker's bryant with a full beard. Actually, yeah, do you know what that would smell like if it caught fire? It would smell like mayonnaise. It's it's smell worse than mandaise ever did. Jerry's in there like she doesn't like the smell of burning hair or mannix um. Burning mayonnaise would be particularly bad if you had hair on top of your burning hairy mannaise the worst thing you can burn, So chuck. Hopefully that will never happen while you're alive. It could possibly happen um after you're deceased, if you're cremated. Like a fellow named Ralph White, who you know about? I've never heard of the guy you have to chuck. Do you remember that horrid webcast we used to have. Yes, there's a guy. He was the president past president of the Adventurers Adventurers Club and not to be confused with the one from South Park. This guy UM was a real life adventure and he he was I think he was like a a cameraman for UM a skydiving show called rip Chord National Geographic. He was there when they discovered the Titanic Buddies with the Jim Cameron. Yeah he was. He was second director I think on Titanic. Yeah, who was Jim Cameron was also in that club, the little Club in l A. That's right. Yeah, I'll bet Ralph White got Jim Cameron in. And are we calling him Jim Now? I didn't realize we were on that that friendly basis Jim or Jimmy. Well, anyway, Ralph White was had a pretty cool post not post mortem. He had a very cool posthumous story and that was he was cremated and his friends were so dedicated and loyal to him that, Um, whenever they go on to travel now they take about a tenth about a teaspoon or of the teaspoon, some very small amount of Ralph White's cremated remains and scatter and wherever they go. Pretty cool. Yeah, I think he's in the whaling wall in Jerusalem. Um, he's in Lake but call. He went on a space flight and Ralph Whites. Posthumous adventures kind of illustrate all the wonderful things you can do with a cremated body, which is one of the reasons why people choose to be cremated. It's highly portable, right, absolutely, and it's nothing new, Chuck. Cremation has been going on for a very long time, hasn't it. Yeah, we won't get into I mean, there's we could rattle off every country and when they started, but we really could because of this fine, fine article written by a freelancer, right, Michelle Kim. I've never heard of this person before, but it was a really great article. Um. But it has been around since prehistoric times. China has been doing it since eight thousand BC. That's more than ten thousand years ago, more than ten thousand years ago. One part of the history I did find interesting though and fitting since we did our Freemason cast was the Freemasons during the French Revolution kind of push for cremation because it was the whole not anti religion, but just sort of mixing it up with religion. You know. They were anti Catholic Church, well, very much against the Church, and they were saying, if you have yourself cremated, it's kind of like sticking your thumb up because well, because Catholic said, you can't get cremated for a long time. Yeah, well, it kind of contradicts the whole resurrection thing. You know, the body's kind of gotta be intact. It's like the one thing we can't do. You know. We can rise from the dead, but if you're sorry, yeah, and you you don't want to come back and find that you're nothing but asses, because you're gonna be ticked off, right right. Uh. The actual creamator, the cremation chamber, which I like to call the cremator even though it's not. It sounds like a crib star product from the Adventures of Pete and Pete. It does. It was invented in the late eighteen hundreds by Professor Brunetti, and uh, it started in Earnest in the United States in Pennsylvania in eighteen seventies six. Yeah, when Pennsylvania isn't non licensed state still, which I thought was interesting. Is it really Well, there's a little bit of a scandal that we'll talk about later that Um. Apparently, the the crematory business, you either have fine upstanding people or like some of the earth ye running these places, right, Yeah, let's talk about how this works, all right. Yeah, well I got a step for you real quick though. As far as it's popularity, Um, in n three point six percent of bodies were cremated, and just a few years ago that numbers at and they expected to be half right. Well, there's a lot of a lot of reasons why right, I mean, we're running out of land. Um. There's a lot of people who think that burials aren't so green, which is true. Yeah, um, yeah, because they use like, you know, really nice woods and metals, and you have to pour cement lining the bodies and balms, so it's going to eventually leak out all of those things. Right. We'll talk later about whether or not cremations green and the spoilers it's not. Sort of is, but it's not. Well it's not green, but it's definitely not green. It's not brown either, it's not black. It's somewhere between. So chuckers, you're ready to talk. Yeah, Like, just the actual process is pretty gruesome. Um. Initially, they store the body in a cool room just to keep it nice and fresh for the cremation. Um. It's usually examined by a coroner and they have to like sign off and say this is good to go, because you can't exhume the body later on if you need to. No accidental death that hasn't been fully vetted, like I imagine, they wouldn't cremate like someone that was had any kind of relation to a crime or anything like that, at least not for a long time. Uh. And then what happens is they remove some things from your body. If you have the following pacemaker, breast implants, silicon breast implants, prothesis, or cancer seeds, the little radioactive seeds that they inject into a tumor and then be shoot with like a laser or a radio frequency generator. Yeah, none of this stuff is good for for cremation, so they remove that from your body. But there's some things that can't be removed. Well, they could remove it, but they tend not to. Easy fillings, mercury fillings, jewelry, and glasses like some people want, like you would be buried with your glasses on. They want you cremated with your glasses, right. But in some countries, I didn't look this up, so I don't know what countries there are laws against anybody who's cremating a body from touching anything on the body. Right, you gotta do it how you get it right, that's what they say on the shirts. So you can buy, they can get shop. Uh. And then they put the body once it's been removed, these things into a flammable box like a pine or cardboard box or one made of hairy mannaise. They slide it into the incinerator is already preheated, by the way, yes, to at least eleven hundred degrees fahrenheight, which is five degrees celsius. I think off the top of my head. Um, and that's hot, chuck, it's gotta be hot. But that's not like you don't just put the body in and then it just burns. It just catches fire. Right now. They actually shoot a column of flame at the torso like a jet engine. Yeah, basically, So once the body's in what's it called the retort. Uh, it's called a retort. They slide it in there on the old metal rollers and uh. Families. Sometimes you can watch this process through the window if you want, and if your Hindu, and if it's a Hindu cremation, you can actually push go right, Yeah, I guess to start the column of flame. Right you just like so long? Yeah, so here aunt Tina. Uh so the door is sealed up obviously, Um, like you said, they aim at your torso and then this is what happens. This is the gruesome part um as you would expe when you have a jet engine jet flame shot at your torso, it ignites the container initially. Obviously, your body starts to dry out all that water that's in your body pretty quick. Yeah. I would imagine your soft tissue tightens up, it burns up, and it vaporizes. Your skin discolors and blisters and splits, just like a broad Worth on a girl. Yeah, exactly. The muscle chars, it flexes, and your limbs actually can extend like your limbs are moving. I looked all over the place to find the discussions about this stuff about like a body sitting up. That's the closest thing I saw was does a body sit up? I think it was a wicky answer so that it has zero credibility. But if you're if your muscles are contracting or tightening or doing anything like, yeah, your arms can go up. And I mean imagine the people eight and eight thousand BC in China, they're like, wait, they're not dead. Yeah. At a goldfish, I tried to flush one time and I put him in and he started swimming again. And then I put him back in the tank and he just floated. So it was just like the water most and those Well, now I didn't flush it like I would when I put him in the toilet. He started moving every single time. It was weird. That is weird. I'm pretty convinced he was dead though, are he was by the time I froze him in a block of ice. And you'll find out when you get to the the heaven. That's right. Um, So your muscles have charred and tightened, and your limbs are flailing about and your bones obviously you're the last thing to go, and they are calcified and then kind of just flake off and crumble into little bone bits. Yeah, and chuck. Uh. The bones that are or the stuff that is left are the charred bones that are really doesn't take a whole lot, I think to pulverize them, but it does take an extra step and they actually do hold their shape. So you go from a body in a box to like a charred skeleton is what it ultimately comes down to and you either rake or sweep the remaining like bone material into something called the cremulator cremulate, and that is the that's a grinder that grinds up everything and pulverizes into this fine, grainy actually coarse grainy powder. Yeah. They described it as like um ash is sort of a weird word because it's not like a like a charred ash from your fire. It's it's more like gravel, they said, like little tiny bits of gravel because it's pulverized bone. Right, um. And it usually takes about two to three hours, depending on the kind of uh crematory. I guess whatever machine you put it in. Yeah, there's different kinds, right, and how big your bones are too, that has something to do with it too. But also UM, I found that it depends on the level of well, there's there's something called the um enter Tech four. You should go on to Matthew's crematorium dot com. They have specs and it's just weird because these guys are like selling their crematorium uh, and here's all the specs for them. This thing is like state of the art. Interchech four is um and it burns a body and no more than seventy five minutes. Really, that's pretty good. That must have been the modern ones that they say are all like automated. Now, well they also sell them ones that burn a body in four hours. So it's like low end to high end. Okay, you know what I mean. Pay for what you get um. And at the end of this whole process, you're gonna end up with about three to nine pounds of ash. And that's actually that's where it depends on your bones. They say it doesn't matter like how fat you are because that I think that burns away pretty easily. Yeah, I would think. So it's like your bone structure. Bones tough to burn, I guess. So, so chuck these things. We said that they are preheated to about eleven degrees, right, but they get up to about two thousand. So you can't just build this thing. You can't build an inner chech or whatever you're building out of um regular brick or cment or something like that. I think it explode the first time you tried to do this. So these specialized composite brick material and actually over time the interior will be eaten away by the heat and the expansion and contraction will actually lose surface. So apparently what's recommended is after UM the bricks lose about half of their width, they have to be replaced. Yeah, and it sounds kind of crude, But the way it's described in the article, and the way I've heard it described is it's it's sort of like a pizza oven. Yeah, they're made of similar things. Cooka pizza, cooka body, cookade body. So these things go for a two and fifty thou something like that. UM, and they use natural gas or propane or um propane accessories or diesel. I've seen UM. But they used to burn coal, and I imagine that was a real pain in body back in the sixties. I think they were still using coal. I gotta keep stoking that fire, right. Another thing I thought was cool was UM And I started thinking too, when you when you burn a fire, obviously you see ashes kind of floating all over the place, and I thought, well, surely they've got a you know, account for that when you're burning a body, and they do. They ignite a second flame in a side chamber, and that burns off dust that's trying to escape the retort, and some of them even shoot water out the top to make sure none of the dust escapes out of the top of the plume. I guess it's called what scrubbing, wet scrubbing? What what else do we do? Oh? That was the a fluorid thing, right, descrubbing the inside of the and carbon sequestion sequestration. Yeah, my brain is getting too full these days, I do we need to stop doing the show. And after it's all done, you can actually get remains cremated remains. And I found that they say that you shouldn't call them creamines. That's what the the c A n A says. Why they just say it's sort of a crude thing that people non industry people say, let's just shorten it. And they're like, they think it's disrespected, So we won't say the word cremains. But you can have your cremated remains mailed to you via USPS if you want. But that's it in the United States eights. You can't do it via FedEx or ups or you can't if they know what's in the box. Um and I couldn't find out why there's no explanation on ups IS or FedEx this site. They just say you can't. We won't ship that. They also won't ship a disinterred body. Well, thank goodness for that, I guess. But um, the only thing I could the only suggestion I could find why they wouldn't do this, You can't ensure cremated remains. Oh yeah, that's probably it, which I imagine they ensure everything somehow, And they do want to get hit with a lawsuit, right because people get mad when you lose their Yeah. Probably so. The other cool thing about the USPS, though, is that they make sure to point out that it's got to be a sift proof box. You don't want like ashes leaking out the side, and you have to have like somebody's got a sign for it. Right. So usually if you don't get an urn or whatever, when when you get your created remains, um, the crematorium will have them in like basically a plastic bag inside maybe a plastic line designed to hold this kind of thing, right yeah, and there may be just like very small remnants of other people with your remains. Like they did the best job they can. They burn one body at a time. Um, like you know, if you're on the up and up, as a good cremator should be. But inevitably when you're talking about ash and you're sweeping it out, there might be a little bit of Joe mixed in with Harry, if you know what I mean. Well, I know what you mean, so chuck it. Also, I guess the industry standard is, just like you don't want to switch babies in the hospital, at the other end of life, you don't want to switch cremated remains of dead people. Right. So apparently they'll stick a tag in your mouth like a metal disc, or they'll put it somewhere on your person so that when you're when you're melted down, this thing is still there so you can be identified. Um, You've got paperwork that goes with you from the moment you come to the crematorium to the moment you leave. That's supposed to be with you every step of the way. Um, And there's basically all of this is supposed to avoid a mix up, Right, You're supposed to. It doesn't always, especially when the crematorium operator or owner isn't on the up and up, as you said, And there's been plenty of examples of that, haven't there been. Yeah, I was a little alarmed to find out how little regulation goes on in some states. Yeah, only until the Tri States Tri State crematorium Candle of I think two to Uh. Did Georgia close its loopholes and now all crematoriums have to be licensed by the state. Yeah, in Georgia. But and and I actually got a different number here she said, twenty three of the fifty states license, I've actually got only eight do not license, is what I found. Oh well, that's that's that's bettering. But if you look all of these, um, the examples in this article are in the two thousands, So I wonder if that caused like a state expansion or crematorium regulation reform. So, because if you what happened in Georgia will tell you a sec But if you see this on the news and you're in like Pennsylvania, they don't want that kind of news hitting their state. So I would imagine it probably spurred some some action Pennsylvania and Budd we'll talk about the Georgia guy first, very Brent Marsh Yeah, pleaded guilty and apologized. Yeah he uh he owned a CREMATORI um in noble Georgia, and neither Chuck Nora, I know where that is, so don't ask um. I think it's a probably in the north west because it's where Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama come together, which is why you call it tried state crematorium. He was serving all three states, UM and in all three states the bodies of the beloved deceased were basically half buried out in the backyard because the cremator broke down and they just never got it fixed. Yeah, the incinerator broke and so I think three hundred and thirty six bodies in total were found and UM I found they originally they could only charge him with accepting money and fraud for services not rendered. Yeah, there was no there's no law in the books. They hit him with some other stuff though I think it must have come out after this article. He was actually charged with UM almost eight hundred counts of theft and abuse of a corpse. So they actually charging with stealing these corpses. You don't want to go to prison within an abuse of a corpse wrap on your head. They'll find out about that. Yeah, And he was sentenced to eight thousand years in prison and UM plea bargain that down to twelve years. Somehow did you say eight thousand years? That was almost a spit. Take that. Yeah, you were drinking your deep drink and you almost fitted out. Uh so, yeah, eight thousand down to twelve, which is pretty good deal for him. Um there was a thirty six million dollar settlement from fifty eight funeral homes that sent bodies to the sky, So they sued the funeral homes and then they brought a suit, an eighty million dollar civil suits settlement against um, this guy and his father's estate. And they probably don't have that kind of dose, so they're probably gonna do what it happens when that happens, which is you go after the insurance company. Oh yeah, the Georgia farm. But the guy didn't even get around to having the incinerator fixed. He does, he's got three bodies in his backyard. But yeah, so he's uh, he's in jail right now as far as yeah, almost for eight thousand years. And you said Pennsylvania didn't want that to happen, Probably it did. In two thousand five. What happened there there was a guy who ran a crematorium and he had a he had a deal with the local women's hospital to cremate the remains of pre term babies. Basically aborted fetuses. This guy's job was to incinerate him. It's probably not a fun contract to sign. Even if that's the way you make your money, you can't feel great about like closing that deal, right, Yeah, yeah, you don't go out for a big fat st Um the authorities, I guess we're tipped off. And they went into his garage and found in boxes the remains of three hundred fetuses. Actually nineteen of them were post term really, so they were born children. Um that he was supposed to cremate and he didn't. But they can only get them on nineteen counts because they're unborn, so he couldn't. They weren't technically human beings under the eyes of the loss, so he didn't get anything for those, But for the nineteen he he got in some trouble, but he set in his body. I don't know, but he had him in boxes in his garage to which is apparently the m O of the shady crematorium operator. Yeah. I hope they did the book at him. Oh yeah, I'm sure they did. That makes me angry. Uh, can't you tell how angry at him? Um? And like Elsinore, California, josh In two thousand three, a a dodgy owner was selling body parts for a medical research like heads yeah too people, Yeah, which means that he was cutting these heads off. Oh yeah, and he was sentenced to twenty years in prison. And did I say just say prison? And then in Mississippi, Uh, there was a really nice guy named Mark Sieep who was mixing human remains together, giving out wrong ashes, dumping them into trash bends and he was found guilty and put in jail too. Yeah did you say that, um Marie Brent Marsh was giving people wood, ash and cement. I didn't mention that, but yeah, that's what he did, because I mean, it's not like he was just like, oh I got nothing and they burned up entirely. He was like, here's some cement and an urn. Thanks for the money. Yeah. I understand that guy's incinerator burning and maybe not having the money to fix it, but I bet you anything he may have made enough money to get it fixed after that and was like, hey, I'm kind of onto something here. We don't actually have to do this as pure profit exactly, So Chuck, before we get into things that you can do with um the remains of a loved one, right, can we talk about it whether or not it's green. I got a couple of stats here that I think are important. So a lot of people are like, a natural burial or a regular burial is not very green, and it's expensive to between like seven and ten grand. But then they also say, you know, I don't want to go entirely green, which is bio cremation, which is alkaline hydrosis. We talked about that before, and what you can do with the dead body. Remember, it turns you into oil that's poured down the drain. That's pretty awesome, it is. So this has to be something in between though, right for the conscientious person who maybe kind of believes in and afterlife and wants to do more with this body that do you believe in afterlife? It's a vague noise. I wonder where you endure trying to believe. It's like a tick sucking like a hot dog pack. So in two thousand nine, Reuters just doing this article on biocremation, they were talking about how green is regular cremation, and it's not green at all like you think about it. You're using tons of natural gas, not tons OF's hyperbolic, but you're using a lot of natural gas or diesel or whatever. You're using a lot of electricity. It takes both. Um, So apparently it releases a standard cremation releases about eight hundred and eighty pounds of CEO two just one body, and that's the big enemy. And it uses enough energy to basically power a five hundred mile road trip, so not not one and the same, like these are two separate things. So it uses the energy to get you across country five miles and it depending on the size of your country, and it releases eight hundred and eighty pounds of CEO two into the air. I wonder what that compares to footprint wise to standard burial. I think it's I think I don't know, and I think it's just entirely different ways. Where I think maybe a natural or a regular traditional burial is more it's more polluting, like directly polluting into the into the ground and the kind of thing, and it's using up resources, where um, a cream nation has less of an impact over time, but immediately it's a lot of input. It requires a lot of input. Gotcha, that's my concept of it, right. I wouldn't mind being burned, but I like the um. Which country was it where they like burn you on top of the wood by like the banks of the river. That's India. Yeah, I like that. That's what how I would want to go. Well, buddy, if you live in India and you're a Hindu, that's exactly how you have to go. That was a perfect segrete of religion. And I guess so. Uh you said Hindu is a mandate cremation. Yeah, They're the only only religion that does. Yeah, and it's uh, it's called um. I'm gonna go ahead and give it a whirl here. Uh antem sandcar? Which is last? Right? You wanna hit the other one? Uh? Antsd? Yeah? Antist? I think? Which is last sacrifice? Yeah? And that is those are one of the sixteen life rituals. I guess it would be the last one. Actually, I'll probably be corrected there. Maybe one after that the whole rebirth and all that. Maybe, but the the I guess the smoke um gets the body to the next life. I bet it's one of the last four. I bet it is. I'll wager on that. Uh. And they yeah, like you said, it's their Hindu. So they say you dispose of this body and it ushers you and helps you be reborn into the next life when you're cremated. And while Hinduism is the only religion that mandates you have that's how you that's how your body is disposed of. Um, Sikhism and Jainism are both kind of strongly adorse it, although they don't require it. Right And Um, you were saying that they cremate people in India along the banks of the river. Most of their cremations from what I understand our open air cremations idea, there's a city called Varanasi, which is apparently is the holy city to be cremated in and you are cremated out and open along the banks of the Ganges. Yeah, that's nice. But they do have an electric crematorium. But since there's a billion people who live in India and all of one electricity, this place that suffers power. Man, that's sad. If you are a Christian, Jewish or your Muslim Josh, they generally frown upon it because or outright prohibited, depending on which religion it is. Yeah, Islam prohibits it. Yeah, they like they want you buried that day the same day you die, preferably right. So Um in Judaism, Chuck Uh, I don't think it's actually restricted. I think you can if you want to. But the m among Orthodox and conservative Jews, the memory of the Holocaust sure still understandably smarts to the point where they're like, why would you want to be cremated? This is you know, that's it's there's legacy is still around. So there's a lot of there's a lot of Jews who don't want to be cremated, even though their religion doesn't prohibit it, right understandably, Um, Protestants, actually is where you're gonna be find some more open minds to cremation. They don't, you know, have any literature that says you should do this, but they're definitely more understanding about it than other really, right. And we talked about the Catholic Church having a problem with it because of its association with subversiveness towards the church. But in the sixties the Catholic Church said, hey, we've never really prohibited it. You can't get cremated if you want, and apparently they gave it a boost. The Hula Burger people really catered for the Catholics in the sixties. I found Canna says that of Catholics are cremated now, so that's quite a boost. I would say. Um. The Mormons also, they're not big on cremation, although they don't prohibit it. And in countries where um it's traditional, they're like, yeah, please go ahead. But the Orthodox Eastern Orthodox Church says nay, yeah yet, good point. Thanks, Um, where are we now with some can we talk about finally what you can do with your remains? I think it's high time to you not what you can do with your remains, because you clearly can't do anything. But that's not what you can do if your remains, but what your friends and family can do with your remains. And sometimes they like to um, keep you in and urn and then they have these little cemetery like buildings called a columbarium. And they just told ashes from what I understand, yeah, it's like a vault. So some people choose that that cost him dough. Obviously, go ahead and tell us about your hero. I know you want to mention that who Hunter t Yeah? Uh yeah, he was mixed with fireworks and shot out of a cannon, a hundred and fifty three foot cannon also called a memorial tower, and apparently it's it was an organization called Heavens Above Fireworks that did this, and every anybody can do it. And Johnny Depth paid for the whole party, right, Yeah, And from what I saw it was if it was this British company, he would have paid about the equivalent of three thousand U S. Dollars for a large fireworks display. That's what they charged. Don't mention money. Actually I did see the average cremation cost is about six d bucks. Yeah, and the average funeral I saw five grand in this article, it's ten grand. Decided, let's say somewhere between five and ten dollars. But back to things you can do. We would be remiss um if we didn't mention to our NERD friends that Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek fame, was everyone knows this. He was shot into space. So was Timothy Learry. Oh yeah, that's right, by the same company, Celestis. And they're still in business as far as I know. I bet they are. And then you got life, Jim. If we've talked about I think again on the webcast. You can take your cremated remains and have them compressed into a synthetic diamond. You can have your remains mixed into paint, and I guess that's not so much you can have, but you can probably just do that. It depends. Like there's there's there's actually a guy who does something called um Ash portraits and he he does it just with the person's ashes, but he'll also mix it in with oil or whatever. Interesting, but he does portraits of the deceased. All right, change my mind. I want to be remembered as dogs playing poker. That would be pretty off, That's what that would be really cool. Uh what else can you do? Um? You can, Oh, you can become part of the coral reef. I know there's companies that do that. There's a company called Eternal Reefs. I think is the big one. This is pretty obvious name, don't you know. And and what they actually they make different sized reefs and what they do is they mix your remains in with cement and like so the big one, it can accommodate up to four family members. So if your family went down in a plane and you just feel like showing out for one, you know, coral reef they've got you cover. It's like seven grand uh huh, and it's pretty big size and it's cool looking. I mean it looks like an artificial reef, and then you take it out and dump it overboard. Fish live amongst your your family members, who I really really hope loved scuba diving exactly. Do you remember Keith Richards a couple of years ago, he's still alive, well now, his dad passed away, and he said that he snorted his father with cocaine and then I mean apparently said the Center interview. Then that came out and he was like, no, no, no, no no, I was just kidding around. I of course I didn't snort my father. I think he snorted his father. I think he did too. The Sound like Um episode where this these people snort the remains of this girl. Yeah, I remember that one. I do have some stats for you, though, what people seem to like to doty percent to keep the ashes at their home, thirty seven percent bury the ashes. Do the scatter very popular? I thought it'd be more popular than that though. The most popular one is water scattering and number two is scattering somewhere on family property. Not really three percent are put in the columbarium. And you might notice, Josh that adds, Yeah, there's one percent that go on claimed, so sad. It is sad, and I apparently the people who own crematoriums find it sad too, because even though after a set period of time and stay that regulate this kind of stuff, which did we say the Federal Trade Commission regulates mortuaries, there's no federal oversight for any crematorium comes out of the state. Um but in states where there are regulations, they still say you can throw these out after a set period of time. But most crematoriums, the up and up ones will hang onto these things for decades because again it's a small box. But I mean, they don't want to just throw it away. It's and it's only one percent, So I don't imagine they're like overflowing with unclaimed remains. I would hope not. But since you did mention the scattering, we should talk about some of the laws about scattering, because you can't just scatter anywhere. No, the National Park Service has no official stance on scattering remains. They leave it up to each individual park, but most of the park say unless there's like a grave area, like it designated grave area, you can't scatter ashes here. Well, it also said they kind of turned a blind eye, like they know it os on and I'm sure some ashes in Yosemite Park are like how are you going to tell the difference between that and like fire ash or dirt or whatever. Um, But state parks they say, actually, the National Forest Service doesn't regulate anything on their land. So that's where you would probably want to go, like avoid the National park and just stay in the National Forest or go to your state park that was a beloved state park, because they're a little more lax than the national parks, right them. If you want to do water scattering or ocean scattering, Um, the e p A says you've gotta be three miles away from the coastline, right, very prudish. California is like that's way too much. Um, they still have restriction, but it's five feet right yeah, pretty close. Um. And people don't always follow regulations, right. Yeah. So you want to tell about the Cubs fan, Yeah, this is kind of a nice story. Um, Steve Goodman died of lukemi in die hard Cuvees fan sadly did not get to see the Cubs winn World Series. As likely neither will you, and I um. And four years later he his buddy snuck in before opening day and threw the ashes into the wind out over the field. Nice. Pretty cool. That is pretty cool. Did you ever hear of Graham Parsons story? His body was stolen right yeah, his friends, Um, he said that he wanted to be cremated and scattered on cap rock in Joshua Tree National Park. Right. Um and his parents found out he was dead and had his bodyship back for a private funeral, and his friends found out that they weren't going to be invited, so they stole him and uh took him out to Joshua Tree and opened the casket through some gasoline on him and set him on fire five gallons of gas right, and it didn't work because we've said what it takes. So he was half cremated by the time the cops showed up. He's sort of melty and just like Georgia. Back then, there was nothing about there were no penalties for stealing a corpse, so they got them for theft of a casket. I think that was Did you see that movie? Johnny Knoxville played the guy that his buddy It's not very good. I did stay in the hotel though. Actually I meant to mention that in the Root sixty six. Yeah, the Joshua tree in not in his room though. And before we move on from Scattering josh we have to mention, because we like to mention our movies, the excellent, excellent scene from The Big Lebowski, the scattering scene in the end of when all of them just blew back all over them John Codman. Uh, it was Steve assuming that died, right, I think, and he he threw him out in the window, back in their face over the ocean. It was good. It was very good. Uh, Chuck. If I am dead and I'm being cremated and I'm part of se of the population, what country am i am? Uh? Sweden, Switzerland, Switzerland, I've been cremated and I am part of just a meager three percent of the population. What country am in? Ghana? That's right, That's right? And in between are actually higher than that Hong Kong is. Places like the Czech Republic in Singapore and the UK are sort of mid to high seventies. China and the the Netherlands are about half and uh, Italy as far as European countries was I'm sorry Ireland was six percent, in Italy was seven percent, and I bet that has something to do with the Catholic thing, I would think, so for sure, the US is about thirty right, yeah, thanks for a large Protestant population and Hindu. And there's also pet cremation. Yeah, if you if you want to get into a burgeoning industry that went from pretty much nothing to uh it's a three billion dollar industries. The latest that get into pet cremation and the people at um Matthews Crematorium supply they make pet cream cremators too. They did humans and pets and animals too. Apparently there's different types. So when you could fit a horse in two and one are made for like dogs or something, right, you know I would support or I would I would be more likely to go into one of those because they say that some of the pet only crematoriums are a little um dodgy. Yeah, they're totally unregulated. Yeah, so they're just like burning your pets together and you don't know that the ashes you get and if you're serious enough about your pet to get your pet cremated, then you probably want your pets ashes, right, so you can handle cremation at home just dig a shallow hole in your backyard to serve as a fire break, and do your neighbor is a favor and shave your pet first before you set it on fire. We buried my animals growing up, my pets. Yeah, we have. I think at my old house we probably had like four or five pets buried out in the woods. But we lived on like two acres in the woods. It wasn't like in a neighborhood. You didn't set any fire. No, no, no, no. Well that's it for cremation. Um. Thanks for joining us for that one, right, Chuck. I think we've covered pretty much everything in there. Um. But if you want it's a good, good article, high caliber how stuff Works article, not like the rest of these sninkers. Just type in cremation in the search bar the jazzy search bar at how stuff works dot com. Jazzy. I'm just Chinese stuff. We've been getting lots of suggestions. By the way, I like ubiquitous search bar, and it's pretty good. It's not everywhere, though, I mean, I guess it is everywhere, but it's Yeah, you're right, so uh, I guess it's time for listener mail. Yeah, buddy, I got a couple of today, A couple of short ones. Um. The first one is from the Soniccast and it's a little old, but I promise this guy would read it. This is from Mark and Eastern m D. I know you guys won't read this on a podcast. Those are usually the ones I read, but I just thought i'd write to tell you what happened to me this morning. In my frantic rush to get my daughter Ellie to a summer camp on time, I had to run out of the house without having breakfast. That caused me to have to stop at a fast food joint get one of those gross, greasy breakfast sandwiches. You would think it's bad enough, but it gets worse. As I drive from the driveway, I pushed play on the iPad and start listening to the show and Saunas, where I started hearing about butt funk Chuck's sweating out gallons of fluid and having to visualize a naked Vigo Mortensen fighting in a sauna made my otherwise gross sandwich and greasy potato things one for the books. By the way, the podcast that I queued up next was all about Taste Buds, so now I know how I was able to taste my sandwich in the first place. Thanks a lot, guys. That's from Mark. If you do happen to read this on the on the air, would you would make Ellie and Lydia's day? And those are his daughters. Hey, Ellien, Lydia. So Mark, that is for you, my friend. And then this one I didn't you think about, but it's kind of fitting. Do you remember when I told you about the little girl in Kent, Washington who named her Beta Fish Chuckers Jr. I saw this one. Chuckers Jr. Is no more. Monday night, I put Chuckers Jr. Inside his small bowl so I could clean his bowl in the morning. Yesterday morning, I went to make my breakfast in front of his bowl as usual. But I to make my breakfast, I thought she had might make his, which would be pretty cute. I felt something sticky on my foot and I looked down into my horror. I saw Chucker's junior stuck to my foot, all dried out, and now it's horrible. Apparently Beta's had been known to jump out of their bowls, and I guess Chucker's junior jump pretty far because his bowl was a good foot away from the edge of the counter, yet he still ended up on the floor. My theory is that he probably flopped around or something onto the floor. Um, can't you just let the little girl think special? Yeah, you're right, Chucker's junior special. Katie. Also, I found out that the bowl that he was in had only a centimeter from the time. Where is she from, Liberia? Yeah, she's from Kent, Washington. Um, she said, you're usually supposed to leave about an inch between the top of the thing. I guess to make it harder to jump out. It's the same thing, right, one centimeter equals one inch. I think so and so degrees below she She ends with this, at least Chuckers Jr. Died a healthy fish. That's from Katie, age thirteen in Kent, Washington. Well thanks for your optimism, Katie. Yeah, Kent. I'm sorry about your breakfast sandwich, although I'm hungry now. It wasn't Kent, it was Marked. She was from Kent. Yeah, that's sor right, Mark. Sorry about your breakfast sandwich, KNT.
