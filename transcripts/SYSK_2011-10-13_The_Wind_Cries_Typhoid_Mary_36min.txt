Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Greeny Boy, Chuck and Bryant and Jerry back in the his house. Now more guest producing. No, that was a rough week she was, but she's back. Hey, Jerry, did you hear that? Everybody? Probably not? Chuck? Yes, Jerry. Have you guys ever heard how much manure a horse produces in a day? I'm glad you went with this. I was never really occurred to me. Go ahead, pounds twenty five pounds of manure. Did you do the math? Because I did? Right? Will you come with that in a second? Okay? So, um, just go back with me a little bit, Chuck to the time when Daniel day Lewis was walking around New York with meat Cleaver overacting a little bit in my opinion. Um, And it's the the late nineteenth century, and the horse is the u is the preferred mode of transportation for everything from the the most humble delivery cart to the greatest ambulance to you know, people who like to ride horses. Three musketeers, that kind of thing. Everybody had a horse to the limit to the airport wherever. So there were about two hundred thousand horses in New York City in use in right, Yeah, multiply that times twenty five pounds of poop a day and what do you get chucked? Well? I did two thousand because I thought that was the number. Okay, so that's fine, We'll go with that. More than six point two million pounds of horse poop per day deposited on the streets of New York. Okay, Now, um, let's say that's okay, Um, there's that many horses. There's six point two million pounds of horsepoop every day. It's a lot of poop. But not only that, there was no one cleaning it up. It was not enough people cleaning it up. Let's say that for sure. It was just left there basically in a lot of cases, um to basically be ground into the cobble stone. And you know, it makes you think, like, I'll bet there's a substantial layer of horse manure under the streets of New York that make up like that initial stratum of of of Earth, the Poopa sphere. I think, oh wait, that would be an outer space. No, no, because the lithosphere is yes, so you were dead on. Thank you the popa sphere Um, things change a little bit. The New York Institute's a department of health and a group of basically an army of cleaning guys, very much like the the garbage man that Homer Simpson envisions in the in the It's the Garbage Commissioner episode. I can't remember which one it is. Uh, oh, the Loveday episode is what it is? Okay. Um, These guys, they're called white Wings. They are deployed to clean up the streets of New York and they do a heck of a job. And possibly the fact of the the episode, if I may take it please, this is where the term cleanliness is next to godliness is coined. Pretty cool the New York Department of Health slogan in downtown New York, Josh at the turn of the century. Back then was a disgusting, filthy place. And yet I love New York. I love the history of New York. We watched we both watched the same Nova video on Typhoid Mary today and they had photos of mountains of manure pushed to the sidewalks, and uh, sort of like if you've ever been in New York on garbage day. Imagine all those garbage bags is poop, Yeah, but not pooping bags, just mound poop. And they were dead animal carcasses. Did you see that. Probably it was like these boys playing in the street with just a dead horse right in the middle of their little stickball miamond I guess he was on base or something. And it was just a foul, disgusting, unclean, unsanitary place, which, like you said, led to the formation of the Department of Sanitation, Right, So the Department, the Department of Sanitation um was imbued with a lot of clout from the get Yeah. And as you said that, the Nova documentary on Typhoid Mary, it's called like the Most Dangerous Woman in America, but it's also on YouTube under Typhoid Mary Nova. That's good. It was um, but they had a lot of cloud. They could forcibly inoculate you with these new fangled inoculations. They could forcibly remove you to a quarantine island, and New York had a bunch of them. Yeah, that was popular at the time. But basically, your civil liberties could be entirely suspended without any sort of due process of law. Um. And you if you were considered sick. And a lot of this was based on this new understanding of science of germ theory thanks to our buddy Louis past year bacteriology yep. Um. So the problem was science reporting hadn't been established yet. So all of the people who were in charge understood what was going on. They understood germ theory, they understood innoculations, they understood force quarantine, but no one had explained it to the public fully right, So it's a recipe for disaster. So there's this thing called typhus or typhoid, I'm sorry, And apparently they were one and the same until the nineteenth centuries. About this time, typhus and typhoid typhoid fever were separated. But typhoid fever fever, which is the star of this co star of this episode. Um. It's particularly asked, isn't it it is? Josh, we're talking not just ordinary diarrhea, but doubled over cramping, painful diarrhea. I think you'd call that violent diarrhea, violent diarrhea, high fever, red rashes, sleeplessness, death if you don't treat it. A lot of people through history have been stricken with it, including Mary Todd Lincoln, Georgia O'Keefe, Rabbi Shankar I really uh, Frank McCourt author, and Wilbur Wright actually of the Wright Brothers fame died from typhoid fever. Wow, pretty sad And that was I mean, that's a scant uh sampling from a long, long list of famous people that have Those are the people who count who had typhois. I think Lincoln's son actually died from it as well, but I don't think Mary Todd Lincoln died from it. Yeah, but you can know she died of um or something like that is what they would have called abraham hysterics, right, okay, nice. Um. So, before we started to get a handle on typhoid fever, it's by the way, it's a um it's caused by the bacterium Salmonella TYPEE. It's a type of Salmonella UM. And before we got a handle on it with antibiotics, apparently twelve percent of people died from typhoid. So it was a big public health problem. Yeah, New York especially there were four thousand new cases per year and killed one in ten people at the time or one And remember that that nationwide. Uh yeah, as I understand it before antibiotic, so um, let's even just say tem percent. That's a big public health problem. And because it's spread by the bacterium salmonella. Did that come out weird because it did in my head slightly a little bit of the lazy tongue there, because because of because it's spread through salmonella, or because it's a result of salmonella, it's very very easily spread from handling your own poop e g. Using the bathroom, not washing your hands, and then handling food, uncooked food specifically. Yeah, it was normally considered to be like a disease of the lower classes. Yeah, until nineteen oh six. Was it chuck the summer of nineteen oh six in a in a wealthy quarter of the United States on Long Island called Oyster Bay. Billy Joels film, I believe it's neither here nor there. Still, that's one extra fact you just gave everybody. That's true. Uh yeah. When it when it happened in Oyster Bay, it was a much bigger deal because it was more closely associated with let's say, the Lower east Side tenement housing the filth of Lower Manhattan at the time they've cleaned all that up. Now, um, it's expense. What you get though, when you're in Oyster Bay is you get wealthy families who can spend a little money, and that's what you had. In the case of the Thompson family, they were afraid that they would not be able to rent out the house that they were living in because uh, people were getting sick in that house over and over and over and they couldn't figure it out. They decided to hire an investigator who turned out to be a very prominent figure in this case name Dr George Soper, a sanitation engineer and UH epidemiologists, one of the first epidemiologists really looking to make his career well, he already had out he had a reputation um of of you know, being able to track any illness back to his source. So this family, the Thompson family, is that the one who owned the house or the one who's who got sick. They owned the house, and I believe some family members had also gotten sick. Okay, so but there was a family that rented it originally that's where the typhoid outbreak first happened. So maybe maybe they were just the homeowners. The Thompson family hired Soaper I believe, yeah yeah, and said, hey, we can't this house anymore because people are dying from typhoid. Concerned, right, yeah. So Soaper gets on the case, starts some finds the family where the typhoid outbreak occurred, and starts interviewing the heck out of him, and he's stumped. He can't figure it out, like, where did this thing come from? There? These are clearly patient zeros right here, like nobody else on know Weyster Bay had it before then they didn't bring it with them from the city. There's somebody missing, there's something missing. And he finally says, have I talked to everybody who was in this house in the summer of nineteen o six and they said you should talk to typhoid Mary, I don't know. I didn't think of that. He goes what you know, what he did was he interviewed kitchen staff and it turns out that there was a former employee that was no longer there, Mary Mallon, and he said, wait a minute, you know, maybe I should check this lady out. Turns out she loved to serve this ice cream and fresh peaches. Which is uncooked. That was her, I guess her. She was noted for that dessert, right, But even more incriminating than the dessert is the idea that when he looked into her history, she'd worked for eight families in ten years, and six of those families said had typhoid outbreaks. So he began to think that there was something special about Mary mallon and and that she was what's called a healthy carrier meaning um and and I'm just gonna paraphrase this awesome way that Nova doc put it right. When you get typhoid fever, there's almost always a clear winner. If the bacteria wins, you doe, and if you if you win, if your immune system wins, the bacteria dies. But there's sometimes where there's a stalemate where your immune system continues to function and you live, and the bacteria continues to live in your system, which means you're healthy, but you're also extremely contagious. And that's what Soaper came to believe Mary Mallen was. So she was technically she actually had typhoid fever, but her immune system was able to suppress all of it except the killing of all the bacteria part. So pretty cool, souper cool but interesting because this is brand new. Yeah, and as guy's on the cutting edge of this kind of thinking. Yeah, and he knew like, potentially she could be the face of bacteriology. The first bacteriology lab had just set up in New York City and it was a burgeoning, uh not industry but science. So he was like, man, this is really gonna put me on the map if I can probably prove this at least. So he he didn't have any training in science reporting either, though, did he He didn't have training in people skills studently either. He goes to her and he's like, I finally found you. I believe you're infected with typhoid. So I need samples of your stool, your urine and your blood. By the way, my name is George Soper. Good to me And she's like, oh, no, you're not. Yeah. So it's about this time that that Mary Mallen. We should describe who she is at least, go ahead. Mary Mallen was Irish. She or Irish, came over as a teenager by herself. She was born in the poorest town county in Ireland, and Ireland at that time, especially in the poorest County not a great place to be no, also dirty, also lots of death and dying in filth and disease. And she was born in eighteen sixty nine, so I think that's on the heels of the Potato famine, if not still in the middle of it. So she comes over as a teenager, lives with her aunt and her uncle who passed away, and then is basically on her own in New York. And by all accounts, as a result of how she grew up in Thanto being on her in New York, she was very, very tough, in fiery and independent and resourceful. Like had it been anyone else, this might not have gone down like this. They picked, literally not picked. But as it turns out, it sounds like she was the toughest, most obstinate, stubborn, fiery woman in New York City, right. And but she was also good at what she did. She worked her way up in the domestic servant classes to the pinnacle of it. A cook in that era in the domestic in domestic service, and sort of manager of the kitchen staff. Well, not just that, almost the whole house, basically the all of the servants. The cook was pretty much at the top, maybe tied with the butler, depending on the house. But um, she was a cook for all these these families, and not just you know, families that could afford a cook, but like very wealthy families. Um, really well at her at her job. But she took no guff from any man. And when Soaper came and told her that he wanted her feces, she chased him off with a carving fork. Supposedly, that's how Super reported it. Yeah, and you know, we'll get into her specifics later, and she got a real bad rap, but at the time there was, like you said, there was no understanding on the public's behalf of this. This whole zero I'm sorry, healthy carrier is not even proven yet. So I mean, what is she supposed to do? Just say, like, sure, I'll go with you stranger, take my poop and and put me in a quarantine. Yeah, So she fought it like she probably had every right to right most initial though wouldn't normally, you know, brain to a fork, a carving fork on somebody. But again it's lost to history whether she really did do that or not. It's a good story. So Super takes off and he's not one to let his career just kind of slip through his fingers, and he goes to the New York Commissioner of Health, Herman Biggs. So Biggs was he was the one. He was the first one, and he was the one who was like, oh, by the way, we can come into your house and forcibly inoculate you and your children if we want, and we will do that too if we if we think that it's in the interests of the public health. So Biggs was very sympathetic to Soaper's description of the story of this crazy Irish woman who was just patient zero and more than one outbreak um and basically needed to be dealt with. So he ordered a one of his case workers, a few a few cops in an ambulance out to where Mary lived a tenement. Yeah, Josephine Baker was the inspector and not the dancer. No, but she apparently was pretty tough lady as well. She started her own rainbow family. Oh really yeah. Oh, and you know, we should also point out one of the reasons that Mallon was so upset initially was that she got the feeling that were essentially calling her dirty an unsanit here because he explained to her, like, oh, you go poop and then you get poop in your hands and you handle peaches that you feed people, and so she was very uh, she was upset that they felt like she they were picking on her cleanliness, like just a dirty Irish and mcgrinners exactly. They were, you know, dirty drunks and causing problems and that was just the stereotype at the time and she wasn't like that, she said, right, so, um, soaper goes to Biggs. Biggs orders some people out. They used their power and grab Mary. Well, she hides out in the house for a while though okay, like it took three hours to find her. Well when they finally did, apparently it took all either three or four cops to drag her to the ambulance and then the the female case workers sat on her for the whole ride to this hospital, this quarantine hospital, where she was kept for a while. And like you said, it's it just happened to work out that the person who was who was tie Foyd Mary was this very stubborn, obstinate, self assertive woman from Ireland, and she came about at a time where there's a big question about public health, like you know, where do an individual, civil rights and public the greater public good begin. That's still going on, it still is. But she forced this, this conversation into the national spotlight starting about now. So they keep her. They test her. They they're like, you need to poop into this bag right now, and she did um and they tested it and they said, well, thing's lousy with typhoid. They called her stool a factory for typhoid. Yeah. And what they did was they said, here's a deal. Give up cooking because that's how you're transmitting this, and we'll let you go. And so did they say that immediately from the article, but not necessarily from the document. I think they initially offered her that deal that she refused stwhich was one reason why she was you know, lambasted in the in the public later on in newspapers. But again, at the time, she had managed to climb up out of the uh, you know, poor conditions that she was living in an Ireland and get a really good job and one that she was good at and she didn't want to have to learn something new and start over again. So at the time, you know, like later on I can doll out some of the blame on her, but early on she still feels well, It's like, I'm not sick. This doesn't make any sense. What does this healthy carrier thing? Yes, yeah, she was not buying it at all, and she basically came to believe that the public Health department had a vendetta against her personally and felt quite persecuted. Um So when she said no, she wasn't going to stop cooking, they said, okay, well we're gonna take you to a nice little island called North Brother Island. It's not a nice island. Seven. They took her there in quarantine her. Their North Brother Island is a or it was a tuberculosis hospital, old quarantine quarantine hospital, i should say. And she didn't have tuberculosis, and she wasn't even sick, she didn't have any symptoms, and yet she was being kept here against her will on North Brother Island, which you sent a killer urban exploration photo spread that I want everybody to go check out. It's creepy. It's on Gothamist dot com and the g O T H A M I S T. And it's titled a Trip to the Abandoned North Brother Island. It is so cool. Yeah. Located there was a Riverside hospital and initially there was nothing there and they said, hey, the idea of island quarantines was pretty popular at the time, so we should build a hospital there so we can treat these people. But UM, North Brother Island sort of gained a reputation over the years because one it was I mean, it was much more than tuberculosis. It was like later on it was like heroin junkies were treated their syphilis like any kind of nasty disease or addiction. They would dump you on at Riverside Hospital. It was an asylum basically was it was sort of like, uh, what's the DiCaprio, Shutter Island, shutter Rock Island, um. But they had a hard time staffing it with real doctors for a while because doctors understandably didn't want to work there, so they had nurses only for a time. Eventually there was a public campaign to clean it up and to build better buildings and change his rep which sort of worked, sort of didn't. But UM in New York City at the time, especially on the Lowery Side and where poor people lived, it had a very bad reputation as you don't want to go there, because you go there and you don't come back. People were afraid of it. So that's where they send this Mary Malin off to so and when she gets there, Um, she starts trying to get out. She hired a escaping right now, using legal channels, she um. She she hired a lab, a private lab, and started sending them samples of her stool and they were testing it and they were not getting the same result. Her boyfriend would sneak her poop to the lab and they weren't getting the same results that the Public Health Department said that they were getting. UM. As far as her being a factory for typhoid, which could have been a false negative, right, it could have been because they said that you don't always find it in the testing, and that what they said in the documentary. I believe so. But there was a discrepancy and it was enough for her to get her day in court New York Supreme Court. So she makes her way. She's allowed to um to leave the island to go for her court date. And basically the Public Health Department was like, look, she's a she's a healthy carrier, and she's a public health and Mary's like these people are holding me against my will, and the New York Supreme Court said you're a public health threat. Go back to North Brother Island. Yeah. And around the same time it started getting newspaper coverage courtesy of William Randolph Hurst, who may have financed her um law. That's crazy, her legal expenses. Imagine it was. It was great for papers. So yeah, I could see him throwing a little money towards it. But that's where she was dubbed typhoid Mary, and that's where the public cement really swung, because she was painted as someone who was willingly giving people typhoid fever. Well, no, she was. She was called typhoid Mary because they were protecting her um her identity as well. That didn't work too well. No, So Mary Um goes back to North Brother Island and is there um for another Well, she was there for three years total, I believe, and on in the third year, New York City got a new health commissioner and he was not about basically squashing people's civil rights letterly so he not. He not only freed her, he got her job. Yeah, and a lot of people while she was incarcerated, and it wasn't incarceration I guess um there were a lot of people that did cry out for her release at times, um public officials even, but the Department of Health, basically it was such a unique case they wanted to experiment on her and said, now we're gonna test do some tests on her and not let her out. Well, they did do some tests on or They thought that perhaps the gall block her gallbladder was the culprit. So they were like, we're gonna take your gallbladder out, and she's like, nobody's touching me. She's afraid they're gonna kill her, but it could have to. They did forcibly um medicate her. They tried some stuff out, and she said that she wrote in a diary that she if they keep this up for much longer, she'll surely die because it's just such a side effects were so horrid. So it wasn't just like, hey, stay in this cottage, there's a nice view of the water. It was it was rough for her. In addition to the civil liberties being squashed exactly. And so, as you pointed out, the new commission comes in letterly of public health and a bit more sympathetic, Like he said, he found her a job and laundry, which apparently was the bottom of the barrel for for a woman a woman's career aspirations and in domestic servant like no money, like the lowest pay, the worst work. And she was like this sucks. I don't want to do this, right, I don't want to work in the laundry. Did you know that Atlanta has one of the taxi drivers in Atlanta? Um is a Ghanese king? Now? Why, that's what I thought of when I UM, when I when I was reading about that. When when she got a job in the laundry, It's like she worked her way past that. She's way past that. Is he? Really there's a Ghanese king coming to America who operates a cab here in Atlanta. Ain't none but ltraperm Yeah, that was a good movie. I could quote it from heart, I think in full. Let's start, okay, barking like a dog. Oh alright, So back to Mary. Where are we here? She's just been released or he offered her the job, right, yeah, and she's out and she's yeah, but she's making contact with the health department there, like we need to be able to keep up with you and make sure we know what you're doing and everything, and then they're they're like, we know where she is, we know what she's doing. We talked to her every day, and Okay, we lost her. Yeah, we don't know where she is anymore. Yeah, it's pretty cool at the time. You could disappear and if you don't leave afarding address or it's like oh no Google searching going on there, you could disappear into the folds of Daniel day Lewis is overacting. So a few years after this, Josh, after they had lost her, Uh, Dr Soapers brought in again to investigate another typhoid outbreak at the upscale hospital, Sloane Hospital, and I think it was a baby birth in hospital at the time, maternity hospital. And uh what they discovered was Mary was cooking in the kitchen at the hospital. Yeah, under an assumed name. Doctors and nurses were sick, and I believe two of them died and they said, you know, um, you're in big trouble this time. Yeah. But not only did they discover it was Soaper himself was called into the case. This is like Lama's rob and he exactly, it is very much like that, Um, and he comes to the hospital and he recognizes Mary by sight as one of the cooking staffs, Like you were kidding me. She's whipping up her ice cream and beaches and just stops like amid stroke, like um, her hands awkward. So um. This time she goes willingly. She knows that that it's it's over, it's done. She still doesn't believe that she is the um this a carrier or the problem, but she knows that they think she is, and that she's broken some sort of horrendous loss. It was kind of sad at that point from the way it was described in the documentary. She was just sort of like, I mean, all the fight of this fiery woman was gone, and she's just like, I just can't fight this anymore. Take me. And part of it, also, I imagine, was public opinion turned against her. Like you said, the first time she was incarcerated at UM North Brother Island, there was a lot of public outcry. This time there's a lot of public outcry, but it was against her because she had willfully and knowingly gone back into cooking UM and had gotten more people sick. Yeah, and I think fifty something cases were attributed to her in three deaths. Yeah, I think fifty two is what I read. Um, And you know, we gotta say, like, I'm defending her in a lot of ways. But she they gave her a few pretty good deals along the way that she did not take, which was a to give up cooking be um. I think at one point they said, why don't you just move to Connecticut with your sister? And she was like, I don't have a sister, and they're like, sure you do, Jane, She's like, wait, are you having a stroke? Exactly? So she didn't take him up on that offer, and um, soaper promised her of the profits of a book that he would write about her and about the situation, and she was like, no, no, no, it wasn't that weird. Anthony Bourdain is one of the experts in that Nova documentary A little odd. Yeah, I guess he knows it's typhoid Mary. He lives on Oyster Bay. I guess with Billy Joel. So the legacy um of typhoid Mary is this great debate over how much civil liberty, how many how many civil rights does a person get to keep when they pose some sort of public health threat. And I guess the answer to that is contagion yes, have you seen it? I have not. You did the other night, right, it was good? Frightening? No, it was definitely like I don't my back was tense the whole time. It wasn't frightening, but it was. Kid. That was a really good editorial piece too that I read I sent you. Um, we're basically this could have gone down in so many different ways. It was sort of like the perfect storm of headstrong woman, uh, healthy guy that didn't have a lot of people skills. They said, if that or his opinion was, if that initial meeting had have gone down differently, the whole history might be rewritten. But it went down as them butting heads and just got worse from there. Pretty interesting. So typhoid Mary, was she a bad person? Josh, I can't. I reserved judgment on historical figures. Okay, I don't. I don't know enough about him. Yeah, I think you can only judge your contemporaries. Really, all right, what about me? I reserved judgment on on podcasters? Yeah. So, Um, if you want to know more about typeoid Mary, you can watch Nova's excellent documentary The Most Dangerous Woman in America. Um, if you want to know the origin of the word quarantine. You should go back and listen to our Black Death episode. But if you haven't heard it before and you've read, don't bother emailing in. I know already, I know, I know, I'm sorry. You can also look up the how stuff works article who was typhoid mary T Y P H O I D space M A R Y question mark? You want to type that into the search bar at how stuff works dot com And that means it's time for a listener mail. They should do a good movie about that. I can't believe they haven't. Yeah, this is like great. At the very least, there has to be a book on Soper, Like this is the kind of thing that the public eating up right now, you know, thanks of this um Stars, thanks to this economic collapse. You know the Stars Guard Stars Guard. Did you ever see that doing that live skit? It was during the Stars outbreak and Uh Stars Guard. The actor what's his name, Peter, he was on their pitching. It was like a little infomercial and he's pitching the Stars Guard Stars cards. Awesome. Alrighty, Josh, I'm gonna call this, uh Moon smack down, the Nicest Moon, the Nicest Moons back down, we got all right, because we got a lot of and this guy was actually really really over behind about it. Guys love the podcast. I listened as I ride my bike to and from work past the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on my way to the Moon. Learning interesting facts makes my day a little better. However, I had to send a note about a couple of mistakes in the Moon podcast. You got the current theories about the formation of the moon and how it affects Earth's precession right as far as I know, and those are really the hardest things to understand. So well done. Yeah, but you did perpetuate a few mints. Number one, the Moon doesn't rotate and is dragged along by the Earth. Well sort of. The Moon is held in place by the Earth's gravity, but it does rotate. The reason it doesn't appear to rotate, which is what we were trying to say, uh, is because its period of rotation is exactly the same as its period of revolution around the Earth about twenty nine days. It's tidally locked, which brings me to point number two. The moon has a quote dark side that is never illuminated. Not true. I don't remember saying that, did we say that we must have because everyone said that we did. Maybe we didn't say this. Okay, we've just let people believe that we don't know it, all right. The Moon has one face we never see from Earth, but is not permanently in darkness. That's known as the far side of the Moon. So it's Gary Larson, not dark Vader. Huh uh. Number three, we have tides because the moon quote pulls up on the water on the Earth and pulls up on the Earth underneath as well. Definitely not true. While the Moon's gravity does pull the Earth and its water, the effect is minuscule compared to the Earth's one gravity. It's the horizontal differential in the Moon's gravity across the Earth that causes the water to slide towards and away the direction of the Moon. So the water slide sideways, not up. Wow, that's pretty cool. And that is from Chris By and he he was very cool about it. Um and he says, ps, I'm a little worried about going back and listening to the Sun podcast because the Sun is way more complicated than the Moon than Chris. Don't do it. Don't do it, just skip it, brother, Yeah, go listen to cannonball run. Yeah, that's a good one, no mistakes. That's a great, great one. Or Twinkies that was pretty good too.
