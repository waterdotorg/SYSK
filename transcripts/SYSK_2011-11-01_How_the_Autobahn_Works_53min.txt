Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant room a zoom zoom Chuck who gets psychnic care Clark sounds good, Chuck. I was hoping you bust out a lot of German Bill. We are going to do an episode on the Audubon, as you probably noticed when you clicked play right, Yes, um and uh, We're going to get to the bottom of the age old question. Who zooming? Who Chuck? Or me? Who was that? Aretha Franklin one of her late career pop um songs. She also did the Freeway of Love, so that's interesting. She took up like a you know, the highway theme later in her career. Although who zuiming? Who had nothing to do with Auto Bond? Did it? Uh? No? No? I think I think you could make a case they had to do with sc X Maybe interesting. Didn't every song in the eighties have to do with that or cocaine? Get Out of My Dreams, Get into My Car? What do you think the car is of course, get in the fast lane, baby. Yeah. Yeah, see this is already better than you thought it was gonna be. Let's begin the auto bon Chuck Fodd and Fodd and Botten on the at bond. So we'll get to that in a second. Does a matter of fact, let's get to it now. Who is that Chuck? That's craft work or craft work? Craft work? They you know, they're a German. I actually saw them at the Coachella Festival, and I'm not a fan, so I wasn't that big of a deal to me. I understand their place. It's like the biggest build their own instruments. No, trust me. They were so ahead of their time they had to build their own instrument. The early seventies they were doing techno music. But yeah, I'm just not a fan of that kind of music, so I didn't dig it. But I get it. They're great guys. They seemed like it. Nice dudes. And they had a song called Autobon Yeah, and which was eight in The Big Lebowski. Oh yeah, by the Nihilists. Now well they were Nihilists, but they were the name of the band in The Big Lebowski was Autobon. The name of their album was naggle Beet, which I looked up today. That is the perion perionum, which is the tissue surrounding the fingernail and toe nail. And that was the name of their album. Which eight craft Works album cover The Man Machine. Oh there's some kid whose head just exploded. Yeah, exactly. Um. Also, kraft Work has a play since the Simpsons Pantheon. They made an appear. It's verbally uh in the Fighting Hellfish episode, remember the the German air shows up to claim the artwork and he tells the farm boys to get a room. He's tells everybody to hurry up because he has to go see Kroft. Stop. We should just end it, wrap it up right here, all right, thank you everybody, Um Chuck, let's begin all Uh. You know my brother Bill, I don't know if you've ever met him or not. Okay, Well Bill um got into Porsches for a little while and he got himself a brand new nine eleven Carrera set in like the late nineties. It was sweet. It was silver. The moment it hit fifty five, a spoiler automatically came up. It was just nice, sweet cars and it had like a little sticker on the front and it said it had like a guy's signature on it, and it was like a pen in hand signature. It's a real thing, um And basically it was like I've I've driven this car and this thing is a okay. And he said, you see that that's a German race car driver's signature. This car had like fifteen miles on it when I got it, because they've taken it out on the auto bonn they do that to every single one. So I did a little research. This is the late nineties and from six to today, I thought that Porsche did that with every car. Doing a little research, I figured out that that's not the case. Bill may have been mistaken. It's a myth, or he could have just gotten lucky and just happened to get the car that somebody, uh test drove on the auto bon I think I've heard that before, actually, that Porsche does every single one or yeah, or that they they test, you know, test drive their fleet. Yeah, maybe not all of them. But I didn't see any evidence whatsoever that they do anything. But they do use the auto bon this is the cool part to road test like new models. Or they'll say, hey, you're you're a auto journalist. Why don't you come on over to Germany and drive this thing? And they use would be like us taking a car out on I eighty five or seventy five or probably more appropriately to eight five and just going as fast as we can and then going home and writing about it. I just read an article, like you said, the auto writers. It was car and Driver. I think some dude got a Lamborghini Aventa door and drove and wrote an article about driving two miles an hour on there's a stretch outside of Garmish. Oh yes, garmisht miles of of awesome roadway and it's not like flattened straight, it's curvy and mountainous and apparently that's like one of the great places to go drive fast. Yes, okay, well look for stuff you should know quiz in the future with the answer of Garmish. Yeah, all right, I've been I've been coming up with questions in my head. I can write these. Well yeah, okay, no, I'm gonna I'm going to telepathically beam the quiz to everybody who listens to be should I was writing those quizzes for a while. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. About that. I'm a little testy about this one. I'm not a car guy. You've seen my car. I'm not a car guy either. So I drove a truck, that's true. So are you a truck guy? No, I mean it's just handy. You drive really fast though, and you're old, old beater. Yeah, so I thought you might appreciate this. Uh yeah, No, I'm not like a break a hundred miles an hour kind of guy at all. You're just a break eight within neighborhoods of Atlanta. No. I I've slowed down quite a bit in my old age in residential areas. But yeah, no, I still like to get from point A to point But like being on the Highway, to me, is not a lug street. It's not like a great experience. It's like, Okay, now I can get there as fast as I possibly can. Sure, because that's like an interruption of life, having to drive from one place to know, teleportation, to me would be one of the greatest inventions of all time. I could dig that. Yeah. So, uh, you mentioned the myth that Porsche does that. There's another myth was that Adolf Hitler invented the auto bon Yeah, it's not really true. No, he gets a lot of credit for that. And oh, by the way, we should say to anybody who isn't from Germany or America or any other country in the world, if you don't know what the auto bon is, it is the German UM federal highway system, the boonts auto bon right, bunds thanks UM. That means in English federal highway, motor federal motorway, right, that's yeah, And bond means track, so federal motor track. Okay, strictly translated um and so yeah, Adolf Hitler gets the the lion's share of the credit as the father of the auto bon, but it's it's not correct right now. I mean, the rise of the Nazi war machine definitely had a lot to do with the rise of the auto bon and the how extensive it became. But it's began construction in n and I think the first stretch between Colne, Cologne and Bono. Yeah, but he apparently also gets credit as like the father of the highway system in general. Uh, you know, the U S highway system is UM is modeled after the Autobahn. Most highway most federal interstate systems are UM and Hitler gets the credit, but really, if you go back even further to I think UM nineteen, there was this um high this experimental highway called the avas A v U S Highway in Berlin, right, so that was like arguably the world's first highway because you know, Germans were the world's first auto manufacturers, so they're the first ones to need a highway and they do it right still. And then also there is the Auto Strata in Italy that was built um in the twenties that linked Milan to the lakes in northern Italy. So Hitler may have been inspired, um to to get this plan out the door, but he didn't even come up with the plan. There was another guy who was the pr head for the Berlin I think it was Berlin or maybe just Germany as a whole, the German Chamber of Commerce, and he coined the term auto bonn in like, and the German Chamber of Commerce came up with this plan for this whole thing, um, and then the Nazis stole it, so you had another reason to hate the Nazis. That's if we needed anymore. Yeah, uh so that is true, Josh. They um the initial first sections from Frankfurt to Darmstadt was very straight and they did test Grand Prix racing cars way back when on the stretch of road. Yea, that is true because one dude died. Barrent Rosemeyer died in nineteen thirty eight after setting the very brief record to sixty eight point four three two. His little buddy Rudolphila, that's miles per hour. Right after that, Rudolph Carraciola jumped in his car and went to sixty eight point eight and then Burnt said, oh yeah, let me try that again, and he got in and he died. Yeah. His car lifted off the ground, he got caught a cross wind and he was killed. Um. What's interesting is those two speeds you just mentioned are still the fastest speeds ever clocked down the Auto Bonn in these old cars. Yeah, in one day. Um. And the first guy, Burnt Rosemeyer, he was driving an out of Auto Union V sixteen, which V sixteen Yeah, Um, he in Auto Union eventually became Audi and then um Caracciola, he was driving a Mercedes A V twelve Mercedes W one and he'd beat he'd beat Rosemeyer by like four hundreds of a second or four tenths of a second. Did you see the scars. I mean they look sort of like smaller versions of Chitty Chitty Bank Bank, Yeah, kind of, and they're going two hundred and sixty miles an hour. They look like old timey race cars driven by like old timey race car drivers who died. The guy died that day. That weird, it's weirdly, it's weirdly sad. So um Hitler again, um, father of the auto bonn in some respect, he definitely Um, he took road building to new heights or two new extremes. Um. Apparently you know the Cologne Bond stretch from ninety two, that was the first stretch of highway in Germany, supposedly the first real one. UM. Six years later, under Nazi rule, UM, eighteen hundred and sixty miles of roadway had been completed. So they were like roadmaking machines. Well they were, and that kind of well, he didn't like backfire. But it went into disrepair in a lot of places after the war because the German citizens weren't in such great shape financially after the war. No, and they didn't even get used during the war, which is the whole reason Hitler was building and was for military transport. But a lot of the roads were like two steep, two mountainous, so they didn't use them. So they fell in disrepair and it took a long time. You know, some points were even impassable, and it took a long time before they really got on a campaign to reconstruct them and build them back up to the Great Road. Yes, great road. That's uh, that's the road. This is our second Holy boy, that's shameful. We both just realized that at the same exact podcasts on the Road. Okay, I think this will be the last. Um, yeah, chuck it. It wasn't until the nineties, after East Germany and West Germany got back together, um, that the autobon really started to take the take the legendary form. I think that that we have now that we have of it now, which is now see I got the fourth largest behind America, China and India. Oh is that right? But it says the third. But I'm not sure which one is more recent or or it. Maybe there may have to do with how to how to do with how Indy accounts the road. They count it all twice. Well, if it's like a major expressway or what because India's is way bigger than any of them, I think, but that they might Germans might say like no, no, no, we're talking highways only. Um well look look how about some stats man, it's it's your time to shine. How big is this thing? Uh? I have as of two thousand ten, this pretty recent well thousand, eight hundred and thirteen clicks? Wow? Really yeah, that's the kilometers. Okay, it's actually decreased in size then, because this article has it as twelve thou d kios. But when was that? Maybe that's newer or else it's shrinking and might be actually it's shrinking and it's age. It's it's got sarcopenia. And we should say for our American friends, that's eight thousand miles of right roadway. Very nice. There'll be more stats scatter amount okaysisting exciting. What's another myth? Josh, you can just drive as fast as you want on this thing all over the place? Right? Well, um, no you you can't. You can. But the Germans are very sensible people. They're very efficient. Uh, they're very um really as sensible is a really good word to describe the German people. What might even say rigid, you could say that, UM, and they are well aware that you should not be driving unfettered speed limit wise through congested areas, like through a city or something like that. So in a lot of parts of the Audubon you're going to find speed limits which are called tempo limits UM in German tempo limits tempo limits that which is of course one word. Yeah. So congested areas, areas where like the the terrain is really rough um during certain types of weather. Uh. There's a lot of UM factors that go into it, but it's not unlimited. For about three quarters of the eight thousand miles you'll find speed limits. But then there's about two thousand miles of autobon, about a quarter of the whole thing, where there really isn't any speed limit. Not bad. You can drive as fast as you want, but there is a suggested uh speed limit of UM. I believe a hundred and thirty kilometers per hour, which is eighty miles an hour, But that's suggested. Nobody's gonna pull you over for that. Uh. There is a minimum speed limit of thirty seven miles per hour, which is about sixty kilometers per hour, and that just keeps the riff raff off the road that will get blown away, including mopeds and stuff like that, and well horses, horses which were banned outright from the beginning German highways early on that they wanted this thing to cook, or at least it seems like. But even if it is unlimited, they still can. You can still get a fine if you're driving too fast for like weather conditions. You can also, I mean, if you're going to pass um an autobon cop which are called the auto bon politze. Again one long wordlitz, you you don't want to taunt him, especially if you're holding like a big mac. Yeah, because the Germans consider um driving while eating or drinking a distracted drivers state, and they will pull you over in a heartbeat and find you, and they do it routinely. Yeah. Can I just go ahead and take my hat off to the German people for their sensible and common sense rules when it comes to driving, Sure, chuck, because that is one All of these rules to me should be worldwide because they just make sense. For instance, the two second rule. If you don't follow the two second rule, which means you give yourself two seconds worth of stopping time for the car in front of you. Then you can get a ticket and that's suspended license. Yeah, we should explain that to our younger listeners, maybe ones who don't drive yet. Uh. Say you're following a car and a car passes a street lamp, right, Uh, if you should be able to count off two seconds before you pass that street lamp. That means there's two seconds of space between two seconds of reaction time between you and the car in front of you. That's the two second rule. Yeah, that's a great way to do it. Nice suggestion. Another rule, Josh, which should be adhered here in the United States, travel fast in the left lane only pass on the right only. It just makes sense. Well, so apparently the Germans are extremely well instructed in the art of passing and respecting the passing lane. So, um, I've met so many people on the highway that I really genuinely wanted to take the lives of you've met them. I met him by making eye contact, really angry, vicious eye contact, waiting at them. Um, yeah, on the road because they just not only won't get over, they maybe slow down a little bit when you try to pass them in the in the left lane and they're going too slow. Apparently the Germans do not have this problem. If you are not getting over, if you're in the left lane and you don't get over for a faster driver, you can be fined because they consider that coercion. You were coercing a driver who drives faster than you to drive slower, and that is messed up. And not only that, but if you're going a hundred and twenty miles an hour in that left lane and your Mercedes and going through behind you is in his force and he wants to go one ninety, you gotta get over because you're the slower driver. And also whether whether it's you orgoon turn the left lane, you're not supposed to be in there unless you're passing. The right lanes are for traveling, the left lane is for passing, and you don't drive in the left lane and you can get a fine for that. Um. You're you're allowed to flash your lights and honk your horn at somebody who's going slower to basically say, hey, I don't want to use up my brakes. Get over. If they don't get over, they can get a ticket if you UM, if you do it excessively, supposedly, that's coercient as well, so you can both get a ticket if you find a grumpy auto pullets. That's right, auto bomb pullets. I think anytime you're not sure, just like, do it quiet? Uh? And you mentioned that you know the left lane is for passing. You can also be stopped in fine if you pass on the right. If your excuse was but hey, the guy wouldn't get over, they can say, I'm sorry, you're still getting a ticket, but we'll give him a ticket to if we happen to see that you're you're both gonna get tickets, right, just likes, can it be any more fair than that? And women have to get a license to wear lipstick? What else? Uh? The emergency lane um is for emergencies only here in the United States. When traffic backs up in certain places like l A, people will drive in the emergency lane because they can't wait. Yeah, that's that makes me want to kill two. But they said, I love this part. Even if you run out of gas, that's no excuse because that's an avoidable thing. So that's very sensible as well. I get the feeling that you're it's very shameful as well. In Germany, to run out of gas because they're just so like on top of everything, they're like, you know, if you run out of gas, room, you're you're not worthy of being on the road. Like they have like like page eight of the local papers, just like mug shots of people who ran out of gas in the emergency yesterday. Uh, should we talk about some of these fines? And that's kind of the least interesting part. Yeah, how about this? This will this will drive people on the website after this. If you want to see some fines, some some infractions and the corresponding finds in Euros, look up auto Bonn on how stuffworks dot com. We'll remind you again later at the end of this episode. Another cool thing I like about the system, Josh, it is it's all consistent with how they letter and number everything. Everything on the auto Bonn system has a capital A followed by a number. Even numbers go east west, odd numbers go north south. Same exact thing in the US, is that right? Yes? Seventy five north south, eighty five north south, ninety five north south twenty forty sixty eighty all east west. Same thing is it was modeled on the autobon Eisenhower is like, I love these Nazis. I don't think they're all like that, though, are they? It seems like California had some for interstate for federal highways only, So what about rings. I don't know, UM two eighty five probably larger, I want. I don't know this, but I would suspect that the larger orientation, whether it's east, west or north south, would guide the people naming it giving it a name. So like, I'll bet two eighty five it has longer stretches going east and west or north and south than east and west, which is why it has an odd number. But it's not a perfect circles. I tend to make stuff up, and that could be an example of uh You would think that because of the excessive speeds that the auto bon would be a death trap. I would, and for a while there it was pretty unsafe, like uh N. I think was the all time high when they had more than one deaths that year, which is staggering. It is, but it's less than the United States standard of about forty thousand a year. Yeah, but we have a lot more highway we we we do know. UM. In two thousand eight, though, that number fell to fewer than because of a few things, better engineering in the cars, safety obviously, better engineering of the roadway very much. My dad taught me this. My dad's a mechanical engineer, but engineers. Any type of engineer appreciates the work of any other type of engineer. Um And he taught me to really appreciate a curve where you don't have to move your steering wheel, You just you just tilted slightly and then you just hold it and placed for the whole curve. You don't have to turn it to stay into the curve is a perfectly engineered and perfectly constructed curve. I have driven on a race track and that's how it is. But you can you'll if you pay attention, you'll find that some curves on some highways are better than others, for sure. And every and when you when you're looking out for it, you really appreciate that one curve where you just pull into it. You're like, hat's off to you, guys, It's like, way to go, This is a perfect curve. Yeah. Yeah. When I did Atlanta Motor Speedway, I actually got the feeling that I didn't even need to turn my wheel because the bank it felt like the car just kind of turned itself. I'm sure that's not the case, but I'll bet it is. It was pretty cool. Yeah, what were you doing on at Lant. We did a commercial shoot there years ago and I got I had to go the day before to like get some paper signed from someone. And the guy that worked there said, he's like he did. He literally did. He's like, hey man, he won't take a lap went heck, yeah I do. He's like, you're have any money? It was Unfortunately I was in a production vehicle, so it was a like a GMC yukon suv want like ninety and it felt on the on the high on that track, it felt like I was going about thirty really, so it wasn't actually a thrill. It was just like this is neat. But the banks, man, those are scary, Like I thought I was gonna tip over. That's how steep it I would imagine, so, especially in like an suv, especially in a big suv. Yeah, well it's very fun though. Uh So. Yeah, the autobun is one of the safest roadways in the in the world nowadays United States, but it's not it's in Germany. It's right, don't try and fool me. Uh. There's been talking recent years, Josh, about imposing some speed limits because of environmental factors more than safety. Yeah, apparently if you propose, um putting speed limits on the auto bonn for safety reasons, you're just chided and derided and upbraided like by everyone, like, oh, shut up, you don't know what you're talking about. You clearly just moved here from Spain or something like that, you know. Um, it's all about environment though. And in fact, there's three cities in Germany Bond, Cologne and I think Berlin who have instituted um, what are called oom lot zones. No, I don't think they're room lout zones, boom welt zone, which is an environment zone. And basically it's like you have to have a sticker that shows that your car was um inspected and meets approved a mission standard to be able to drive in this environment zone. So if you drive a nasty diesel car, you can't drive in certain sections of Bond or Cologner I think. Well, speaking of stickers too, you have to have a tire rated for for speed as well, which is another great rule. Well, yeah, you can't if you have a really fast car. You can't have really cheap tires, like your tire has to be rated for your car's top speed or you can be pulled over for that too. Right, But they do allow exceptions, I think for certain kind of winter tires, which you need the sticker for though, to show the cop the pullet side that you're like, I can have these winter tires. Yeah. So obviously they're going to post speed limits all over the autobon for carbon emissions. Right, sure, Wrong, Chancellor Angela merkel Um in this country, you would call her Angela merkel Um. She said in two thousand seven that she would not support any speed limit uh measures for the autobon. I love that. Instead, she said, automakers, why don't you just go make the car as um more efficient? Yeah, with fewer emissions. That's what I love. She's like, no change your cars. And apparently she's she's uh, she's a standard bear for the rest of the country as far as the Audubon goes. You got anything else? I mean no, I don't have anything else. Really, I got I have one thing and this this makes sense? Um. During the Cold War, obviously, the roads were neglected more in East Germany. In West Germany and so that was sort of in a state of disarray, lots of potholes, um, impassable places, major obstacles and um. A lot of these roads were just used for military traffic for a little while. But since the end of the Cold World, since the Wall fell, I think they've tried to help out East Germany a little bit there, Yeah, make the roads a little better so they can be a Germany united in road and spirit. Yes, and they are, yes there, so uh, there you have at the autobon. It's our companion piece to Root sixty six. I remember when I was a kid, it was did you just heard a lot about the autobon? It was like, I don't know, maybe that was the big when cars were really going fast because I just remember the auto well yeah, but that was also the same age where you were, you know, eight to nine times likelier to have a poster of a Lamborghini on the back of your bedroom door with a mug. Yeah, I remember tho. I remember that Garfield one where it was like a real shot of a mansion and like a Lamborghini and all this a boat and all that, but Garfield like super imposed over it was like whoever dies with the most toys wins. Can you imagine a more eighties motto than that? Material? Phil, what are you doing? You've gone astray? He's back though everybody, and he's dead. You don't know what I'm talking about. Look up, is Garfield actually dead? It'll bring up some pretty cool stuff. Um. If you want to know more about the Audubon, including some other trafficing fractions and their corresponding finds in Euros, you want to type in autobon A U, T O, B A H N in the search bar how stuff works dot com. Uh. And since I said search bar in there somewhere, Ah, that means it's time for not listener mail. Sometimes it means it's time for Facebook questions. That's right. And this week, Josh, it's a very special edition of Facebook Questions because these aren't questions about us for a change. We're not gonna sit here and talk about each other, which we love to do. I find it off putting when we do that. Yeah, it's intrusive. How I love it? Uh? These are Facebook questions for our special guest who was here in the studio with this Actually it's me John Hodgman. Everyone, Yeah, I'm here again. But actually, guys, I gotta tell you I'm I'm not actually here. What what do you mean you're sitting here? I'm no, I am I'm currently a hologram. John Hodgeman actual is currently in Brooklyn, New York. So Jerry busted you out? How did that go? She busted you out of the safe room. Oh, that went fine, and I was able to make it back home. You just left. And John Hodgeman actual is in Brooklyn, New York right now promoting, well, actually at the Bellhouse tonight, getting ready to to present the launch of his new book That Is All, which I guess came out today. It came out today, November one, two thousand eleven. So John Hodgeman actual had to be in Brooklyn to begin his book tour, and so he sent me his holographic representation. So should we congratulate you or can you send it? Can you send a message to I can convey a message to Hodgeman Actual? Okay, so we have breakfast this morning. Was that you or was that the actual John Hodge That was me the hologram. Okay, the hologram really puts away the sausage links. Well, you know, when you're a hologram, you can eat whatever you want. Okay, So are you prerecorded or I am an interactive program that responds to stimulus in a very similar way. And yet I see me, Chuck is moving his hand through your head right now, so it looks you look totally solid, but obviously you're not. I am an interactive program that responds to stimulus in a very similar way. I thought I detected odors, John Hodgman odors, but that must just be in my head. I am an interactive program that responds to various stimulus and a in I forget what I was going to say. Well, you know, I guess that's good enough for Facebook questions. Well, I yes, I have a question. Can you feel love? K just let me like this? There? We alright, Hello, I am a holographic John Hodgment. How may I be of service? Well, John, holographic John. We had some fans right in of yours on Facebook because we said, hey, John the hollow Graham is going to be in the office. That's great because John Hodgman usually uses a robot to answer his email perfect then, so this works perfectly. And they responded in kind, and we're you don't know these questions, is not pre prepared. And even if Hodgeman actual did, I don't believe Hodgeman Virtual would be preloaded with these and there's yeah, there's no way that these could be predicted. The due random I'm looking forward to hearing the questions from the millions of fake accounts and offshore banks that are registered at your website. When we will, we will ask it. Now, do you want me to kick off? Are we gonna? Are we gonna call out the people who asked the questions? I think we should. Yeah, we always do so John John the hologram, Yes, I don't know if you know this, but John the actual loves the podcast, love stuff. You should know. He always talked about it's almost to an embarrassing degree. Um, I am aware of his affection for the podcast. Choose not to comment on it, Okay, that's fine, that's fine, But you can you basically have access to all of John the actual thoughts and feelings about certain things. Okay, So, um, we did a podcast, an episode on the Muppets. It's a much beloved episode. I am aware. So this question I think pertains to that. This is from Josh Bailey and he asks which Muppet is your favorite? There can be no question that John Hodgman's favorite Muppet is Kermit. He is an incredible character in American fiction that I adore and also John Hodgman does too. Okay, it's convenient. Um, there is for the most part a consensus on the Internet that I resemble Benson Bunsen Honeydew. Yeah, now that you mentioned that there's a very famous picture of you with said Muppet, is there there is? I've seen it on on my phone. I have Well, I cannot, as a hologram, I cannot confirm whether or not that picture exists. You're you're speaking of something that falls into a nondisclosure agreement that you signed pertaining to the New Muppets movie, of which John Hodgman has no part except visiting a table read. But that but that is that's that. Yes, I think probably the Muppet Movie is one of the sort of most overlooked great film of the seventies, you know what I mean of the great films of the seventies, And I'm including so we're talking you know, The Godfather and Chinatown and you know those those great hard weird complex unsparing French connection. French connection, you know, adult sophisticated, and I don't mean an adult in story, yeah right. Empire Strikes Back obviously falls in that category as well, sort of morally nebulous and and dark. The Muppet Movie is is equally that it is a movie about puppets that go on a journey to Hollywood to make a movie about puppets. And at the end of the movie, all of the puppets seeing about how life is a movie while they're surrounded by fake props that are imitating the fake props from the earlier part of the movie, and then the theater, the ceiling of the theater smashes, and a real rainbow comes in and touches them all. And then Kermit looks directly into the camera, breaks the fourth wall and says to you, the viewer, life is a movie. Write your own ending spoiler alert. Well this is as you know. This is the only movie on which the literary critic Roland Bart was given a screenplay credit, because it's so in Henseley meta and beautiful and yet and yet also emotionally very affecting. I love Kermit the Frog. I love Beaker two put Beaker down, Kermit and Beaker josh Bailey. All right, this is from Joshua Charles Knowles. Favorite board game, favorite cartoon, and favorite Pulletzer recipient. Favorite board game obviously is scrabble, of course. Favorite cartoon animated or or strip cartoon, comic strip work cartoons. Favorite cartoon Let's go with television or flipbook? Yeah? Uh, favorite cartoon watership down?

Pulletzer Prize recipient David Lindsay A bear the Pulleitzer Prize winning play right, David Lindsay a beart? All right? Who am I made fun of? Two podcasts? That's right. That's from Joshua Nols. Thank you, Joshua. Who is the next josh to ask me a question? The next Joshua to ask you a question is bridget reef shop Bell. She's got three names. Well, I guess her question is this follows is judge John Hodgman? Which is a podcast? Is ever going to be a regular weekly or more podcast? I asked that question because it's a question and a bit of a dig. Yeah, I get it, okay, Joshua Bridget, I feel that that hurts. You've probably heard a lot of that lately. Yeah, you know what, Here's some things that happened in my life. I worked for the Daily Show with John Stewart with John Stewart from time to time. I wrote a book that I'm publishing called That Is All That comes out Today. I have, I have human children, I have a cat that needs feeding and tending. And I do a podcast that I love very much called Judge John Hodgman where people call in and I and I and they tell me their disputes and I tell them who's right and he was wrong, and and Jesse Thorne the bailiff, Jesse the producer of j Thorne excuse me, and he recently had a baby. So you know, I've been busy. And also I'm a deranged millionaire. And I took two months off over the summer, sue me, to sit around and and uh and work on my on my inventions. So here's the thing. I was a little busy. We fell off our regular weekly thing. It's hard to get good disputes. It's hard to get disputes where people aren't simply buzz marketing Facebook all the time like we're doing today. Um, we will put that thing out as as often as we can, and I hope it will be weekly, but it will never ever be twice a week because we all know that's podcast death, especially after three years. So that was Joshua Bridget and the other Joshua's out there. Yeah, this is from uh Josh Ginger snap dragon and he writing from second life. Should we eliminate pennies in our currency system? No? Pennies are delightful if any of you if if there were not pennies there, there would not be the great Paul F. Tompkins routine smashed pennies available on his c D freak wharf. Are you're a good friend? He has a good comedian. You ready, Yeah, this one comes flighting lightning round. I'll be fast. Well, we've got we We have a lot of quick A lot of people want to know stuff. I'm happy to tell them from you. Um, there are a lot of people who asked questions about your mustache. Some of them are stupid questions like what's up with the mustache? But what mustache do you look up to the most is on my list? It's Okay, it's better than what's up with the mustache? But I'm choosing this one from Joshua J. McCracken, who has Um Bullwinkle as his avatar. Is your mustache? Attribute to Stanley Tucci's epic performance in The Lovely Bones that, uh that is not the case? Uh, Doc Holiday played by Val kilmar Oh. I totally see it now, ye be dying alcoholic? Yeah, um, your huckle Billy, that was your brilliant John. There was a time in my life in the nineties when I love that performance so much that I was like, maybe I should get tuberculosis. Maybe I should sweat and drink all the time starting at nine am and and cough because I'm already has matic. So I'm halfway there. And look whatid it's them for you? Look, I grew a mustache because that is the only facial hair I could grow. And I wanted to grow some facial hair. And this is what what every hair you see on my face, That is the only hair that I could grow. Like you're trying to grow a beard right now as we speak, and heaven for months. Yeah, that's why I see some stuff down there. No, no, no, no, you don't want to see. I spend a lot of time this summer when I went away as a deranged millionaire experimenting with the beard, because truly, if I really want to be a deranged millionaire, I gotta go full Howard Hughes. Do you know what I mean? Mustache? And why are soul patches? I mean dot Holiday soul patches isn't gonna do it. But it's just not in me. Guys, there's still a part of me that's not deranged and not millionaire enough to do it. So that's the that's the answer. Yeah, that's a lot of people wanted to know that, John, Where do you go some you know, it's like sometimes you wear a different shirt. Can a guy grow a mustache? Yeah? People just want to know why the guys wearing the concern that people have. And there's another here's another perfectly true answer. You notice that the mustache that I'm wearing looks fake because it was so much darker than my regular topic. My whiskers are very dark and my skin is very pale and pallid, much like darc Holidays. And I got a little tired as this happened once where someone came up to me and said, I really like that you're growing a mustache. And it was eleven o'clock in the morning and I had shaved that day. Because when my whiskers would come in they would be very dark. It always looked like I was growing a mustache. So I decided to give nature what it wanted, a right. So that's your answer, thank you, Josh, Josh uh boring, boring, boring is from this is from John Riddium. How do you feel about asian carp that's not that's not the snakehead fishes it I don't know. No, you're thinking of the worm faces asian carpet predatory species. Is that the issue here? I think you're thinking invasive? Invasive? Thank you. Yeah, you really have lightened up a lot of I don't know how to answer that question. I they're they're huge carp and you know, generally I'm a I'm a fan of all. Well, that's a little like Getty Lee's famous words, if you choose not to decide, you still made a choice, John Hodgment, refusing to answer is your answer. But here's one. Here's what I'm gonna sayil Perts famous words and and speaking speaking of of of giant freshwater fish. There is a long section in this book that I have written that comes out today entitled That Is All, the third in the series of Complete World Knowledge, including information on wine and sports and of the world. There's a long section in this book that follows the path of a semi professional noodler who who meets an unhappy end. Noodling, of course, being the sport of sticking your hand down a catfish's mouth um and catching it, yanking and yanking it out, and then he later comes to face the ancient and unspeakable one, the giant catfish, that is the entire Mississippi River. That's another story, but that whole section is an homage to the first episode of Stuff You Should Know I ever listened to. That was the first. It was that very thrilling. And you know what, John, When I was reading your book, I noticed that there were some stuff you should Know threads really well, well, just a couple of things I noticed, like the Mayan calendar and prohibition, prison wine drink taste, sinkhole zombies, flor hey hey hey hey, rogue, taxidermy, odd town festivals, spontaneous human combustion. Wait a minute, Cristal Skulls of the Many Worlds Theory one Near Death Experiences. Do we get any money for this book? John, Look, there's obviously a kinship in the way we look at and think about the world. We're both trying to explain everything. Give me the list and I'll tell you where it came from. You're not getting this list, give me no read it read It just doesn't even have to be in the podcast Prison Prison Wine first revealed to me at the offices of Twitter and two thousand eight. First first came to my attention when I was writing an article for Wired magazine in two thousand seven. Taxoplasmosis, taxoplasmosis, I have a human child, I have a wife who was pregnant. Of course I know that talxoplasmosis. Wait a minute, you hadn't heard about prison wine until two eight. Yeah, that's right. I did spend a night in jail, but it wasn't long enough to make prison one. Crystal Skulls. Go back to my first book, two thousand five, Secrets of Yale University, where I talk about the rumor that the Uh, the the the Whiffin pooss Uh gave the skull of Benjamin Franklin to Dick Cabot on his TV show, And it's not true. It was a crystal skull. Okay, that goes back to the World Book of the Strange that I read in two thousand four writing the first book? Does that have trepen nation in it? Of course it does. Tremp nation I got from from the Golden Compass. Give me more. Come on, I'm not let the stand uh sinkholes. That's from me? Okay. Odd town festivals, that's okay because you actually gave us a thank you for that for noodling. Yeah, we're cited as experts, even a thank you like experts. Yeah, keep going. Really yeah, odd town festivals, that's that. That one's yours. Not that I wasn't aware of a lot of those odd town festivals. Zombies comedies, I know, we didn't invent it. Yeah, no, you didn't. Let me. Let me give you a little history lesson, right, Zombi has been around for a long time. Check out a serpent in the rainbow, dumb, dumb. Next, I saw that in the theater rogue taxidermy bartering. Rogue taxidermy was probably you bartering though that bartering we didn't do bartering house swapping. You mean no, we talked about bartering, didn't we. I'm sure we did in house swapping. Oh. Also, um conjunctions. We use a lot of conjunctions. Bartering goes back to my first my first year of college, when I would tell other freshmen who were from out of states. I went to college the University in Connecticut, and I would just tell people that the Connecticut is the only state in the Union where barter is still a legal form of payment. And then you can go into any like wah wah or convenience store and try to buy things with shiny shells, and if they accept it, it's lead.

We're both trying to explain everything, so there's found to be some overlap. Yeah, but I've been at it since two thousand five exactly, and I also don't care about facts.
