Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know fromhouse stuff Works dot com. Hey, welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles Chucky. Do you realize that some people might this might be the first episode they listened to and they've already turned it off and they're writing an iTunes review? Something's wrong with that guy? Yeah? What's up with the manga? I can't believe they're it's so popular? How does anyone listen to him? Yeah? What's up with the Yeah? And how are they in the top ten? And that guy? It must be like the a MSR thing? What is that? You know? Where that? Uh? People make videos where they're like stroking your hair, but it's really they're just moving their hand by the camera. They're talking like this, what really we calming? But there's a subset of humans who have a central nervous reaction. I just had one, but it's pleasurable. They call him like a brain orgasm, a a m s R. I think is R A s R. I think it's a M s R. I don't remember what it stands for. But it's like a meditative video type of thing. I guess to some people, apparently you have like a reaction to it, and it's very pleasurable. But it's non sexual. It's it's well when you just whisper neurological to me, I had a bad react, right, I can imagine. So I I don't claim to be one of those people. Man, oh man, this is getting off to a good start. But we should do an episode on that sometime. We people have requested it a few times. Yeah, I want to. I'm gonna go find out what it is. Is we have to go to the trouble writing an article for because there's not one that's okay. I got a few of those in the hopper that I'd like to do. I do too, I just haven't been able to get around to him. You've been lazy. No, I've been busy. I said, we are you ready? Are you familiar with halitosis? With with hold, I've got a little intro for this. You've heard the word halitosi is obviously we're about to do an episode on halitosis, so I hope so. But even before this, you've heard the word halitosis bad breath. It's like a clinical term for bad breath. And that is true, and it always was a clinical term for bad breath. But the reason, Chuck, that you and I know that the word halitosis means bad breath is thanks to a nice little marketing scheme by the three guys who ran the company that made listerine back in the nineteen twenties. Yeah. We we've talked about Dr Joesph lister before and that listerine was an antiseptic, surgical antiseptic, yes, and that's and it was marketed as a surgical antiseptic and then a household antiseptic. And then they said, you know what we're we need to expand our market share, so let's get into other markets. And so they said mouthwash. We'll start telling people use it mouthwash. And they made like their office in turn, put some in his mouth, switch it around. He died. So they went and reformulated it a little bit at a little water, right, uh, and then bang boom, they had listering the mouthwash. The problem was, as they said, well, nobody's going to just start using a mouth wash for no good reason. We have to appeal to their low self esteem. And that's what they did by looking through a medical dictionary, finding the word halitosis and saying that's it. Yeah, it's an age old trick and adds is to prey upon your how bad you feel about yourself on a daily basis. Yeah, and especially using a medical jargon Michelle who called it the medical gaze, where it was basically like, if you add something that sounds medically to a problem that your product can can take care of you, you've got gangbusters right there. Yeah. And it was an archaic term, Latin term that had gone away completely. Yeah. It comes from the Latin halitus for breath and the Greek suffix osis, which is used to indicate abnormality or a disease state. Yeah, but prelistering people weren't walking around saying the word halitosis. It had gone the way of the dodo as a word. No. And even still it was kind of like people weren't really doing a lot to take care of their breath anyway. It wasn't a thing until this group from the Listering company said we're gonna make it a thing, and we're gonna make using mouthwash to combat this thing a thing, and they did within a decade. It was just basically like that's what you did, use mouthwash every morning? Yeah, and they I thought it was pretty funny and where'd you get that cracked? Yeah? Correct, Yeah, it was a great article, and they said they went on to use other words uh in advertising later on, like homatosis, which is you didn't have a tract of furniture, and uh bromodosis if you had smelly feet. Yeah, and I don't think those that they didn't catch on as well, not like halatosis. For some reason, halitosis catch on and as a result, there are people out there who have haldophobia. I'm one of them. Oh yeah, not like I don't need to see a shrink. But um, my first girlfriend had halitosis. Yeah, And I think I can say that because I don't think she listens, and I don't think she knows she was my first girlfriend. Like I never said you're my first girlfriend, right, But yeah, she had bad and I say halitos. It's to me, there's a difference between Everyone gets bad breath occasionally, but there's a certain tang that's very identifiable that I call halitosis. And she had it, and I, you know, I felt like I had to kiss her and stuff. This is my first girlfriend. I had to learn how to do that junk. Yeah, man, And it was. I have dreams to this day, halitosis kissing dreams that I like, we'll see something like gorgeous girl in my dream and I go to kiss her and she has like this awful rotten breath. Like it's a occurring dream. So I guess I have holodophobia. I'm very aware of it, and that's why I have a tongue scraper and all that junk. Well, apparently that's one way to treat it. Yeah, well, we're getting ahead of ourselves, so spoiler, and I should say I have had a mild case of holodophobia. It may or may not have been warranted. I don't know. I have my own microphone cover for that reason. I know, but it's not because you're protecting other people from your halitosis, right, You don't want your nose and other people's stuff, right, Yes? Okay, because the microphone cover at one point smells really bad and I got revolted and I ordered one the next day. Right, So how halidophobia refers to your fear of your bad breath, you fearing other people? Yeah, yeah, that's a different thing then. Okay, Yeah, I was worried I have bad breath. I guess part of me, like I have that concern because of other people's bad breath about myself too though. I think that's why I'm like manic about brushing my tongue. Oh yeah, that's where I really got it. I sat next to a movie I sat next to some dude in a movie theater once, and like he was facing forward, I was facing forward and I almost couldn't sit next to him the whole time because it was that bad. You should have moved. I don't know why I didn't. Let's become my self punishing, I guess. No. I used to do that, like a concerts. I always said that I would just always time be next to the most obnoxious drunk and I used to just bother me and get under my skin. But then I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna start moving. Yeah, this didn't make me like. I wasn't mad at the guy. Felt horrible for him, almost to the point where like I was going to get in my car and follow him home, and then like after he got into his house, I was going to come in after him and then sit him down and then maybe we have like um, some milk or something, get him all calmed down. Let him sleep, and then when he woke up the next morning, I'd still be sitting in his kitchen table, and then I would say to him, I have something to tell you. And then I would say, you have really bad breath, man, and he'd say, no, crap, dude, I have a condition. Well that's why you don't necessarily want to say anything to anybody, because they may Yeah, so let's get down to this. Garlic, onions, these are the things that people frequently associate, how it's hostes with yeah, which is a bunch of bs. Well no, I mean like it can give you bad breath, yeah, But that to me, that's the temporary bad breath that one gets just from food. Yeah. And the reason why you do get bad breath from, say, like onions in particulars because garlic, I'm sorry, garlic contains something called allison, which in the stomach is converted to alle methyl sulfide, which is not metabolized and which comes back up as gas from your gut. So when you have bad breath from onions, it's not onion particles in your mouth still, that's gas leaking out of your gut into your mouth and just kind of sticking there. For a couple of hours. You ever take garlic bills? Yeah, there they Yeah, I'd just rather eat garlic any day of the week. Yeah, I mean I eat tons of garlic. I love it. But I have taken garlic pills in the past here and there, and I will forget that I've taken one and then you broke up like for breakfast. But it doesn't taste like good garlic. It tastes aftful. It's medicinal garlic. I didn't find I mean, the pill didn't taste like anything, but my burps definitely taste garlic. See, it was for me, I always. I just thought it was different, tastes different. Yeah, I'd just rather like cut the top off of a whole bulb of garlic, put some olive oil on it, wrap it and foil, or put it in your clay garlic baker and put it in the oven for a little while and show down. Baby. Yeah, just squeeze those things right into your mouth. Good. Yeah, and it's so good for you. We're in stinct today. Uh so you say you you your bed is that you don't your garlic and onions don't count to you? No, I think they're there is bad breath you can just have because maybe you forgot to brush, or obviously morning breath, which we'll get to. And then I think some people, unfortunately, are have a constant state of uh this very specific bad breath. Yeah. So I think one in four people have actual halitosis. Right, that seems a little high. But maybe people are just doing a good job of masking it. Maybe so, but some people aren't. So. Um, what it comes down to, ultimately, chuck, halitosis is as simple as the bacteria in our mouth. Yeah, the fact that we have bacteria. It's the same thing as our armpits. Why they smell bacteria breaking down stuff from our bodies beneficially in distincty little gases, yeah, and giving off little bacteria to the The average person has eight hundred types of bacteria in the mouth, and um, they don't need Like it's a good thing. They don't tell kids stuff like this growing up in school because French kissing probably wouldn't happen, you know, Well, well then maybe they should tell kids in school there, but it's really kind of a disgusting thing. Like you don't see people licking armpits. Some people might, Ben Stiller, Yeah, what was that in Was it Ben Stiller who was into it? I saw it? Or was it a movie? Right? Yeah, I've seen that flirting with Disaster Ben Still, but I can't remember if it was Ben Stiller who was into it, or if it was Josh Brolin was into Uh, Patricia Arquette's armpits, that's right, yeah, and Patricia Arquette was married to be still, Yeah, and she let him lick her armpit. I love that movie. You Can't Catch the Wind, remember that part um all right? Back to the mouth and how disgusting it is. Uh. They say, if you magnified just a single cell on the surface of that tongue, you would see about a hundred types of bacteria just on that cell. So this this bacteria. When you eat and you swallow food after masticating it, which isn't dirty, it means to uh, you leave little particles in your mouth. It gets stuck in your teeth there. Maybe it's like you have beginning periodonal disease. It might get stuck in your gums along your teeth a little bit. The very least, it's gonna get stuck to the back of your tongue and it just kind of sits there, and the bacteria in your mouth love this stuff. It's food to them, and they break it down into particles and particles and they're like, this is pretty good, but I can't get the energy from it fully. So I'm gonna break down the amino acids even further and then bam. When I do, I'm going to basically emit sulfur sulfuric gases, and that's where bad breath comes from. There's sulfuric gases that are again a byproduct of the bacteria eating the food particles in your mouth. Yeah, let's over proteins. Yeah, and it's um. The mouth is a you know, it's a great breeding ground for it because it's clammy and warm and it's just got everything that the bacteria loves to produce those stinky, stinky smells. Um. But dry mouth can also cause halitosis because that's what you get overnight and why you have stinky morning breath because your saliva production decreases when you sleep, Otherwise you just be a drooling mess. Um. I wonder why that doesn't work during naps on your school desk. I don't know, you know, I guess because you don't go to sleep enough maybe or if like your face is pressing against wood, it's a signal of your body to increase wake up, the teacher is coming. But chronic dry mouth UM is something that can affect people during the daytime as well. It's called zero stomia and um. If you have zerostomia, you're gonna have a harder time fighting your bad breath because your mouth is always dry. Like the mouth the saliva just acts as a natural mouthwah exactly. Not only rinses away like food particles, it rints his way bacteria. It rents is away the dead skin cells and dead mouth cells that the bacteria also eat. Um. And Yeah, the dryer it is, the less that action takes place. And you've got stinky breath. Yeah. So if you're on anahistamines or um any depressants or painkillers, uh, dry mouth is a side effect of some of those drugs, so you might have a harder time. Uh. And if you're sick anyway, you're gonna stinky your breath too. Like if you're fighting a sinus infection, let's say it's gross yes breath because that mucus trickles back from your sinuses down to your tongue and sits there and gets eaten up to nasty stuff. Is this whole thing? I'm just cringing. I'm gonna have one of those dreams to it. There's you could a sninky hello toastis breath dream? Yes, the hot girl bad breath. It's always the same. Really know you're having dreams about kissing hot girls with bad breath. Yeah, she thinks it's funny. She thinks it's because of my uh, repressed religious upbringing, repressed sexuality. Like I won't even in my dreams allow myself to kiss the model. That's hilarious, Like she'll have I call it vomit tongue. It's so gross. Oh yeah, that is pretty bad. Yeah. If they're the worst dreams, I can't explain to you because they're really headed in the right direction at first, you know, and it's terrible. And when you're an old mary man, that's all you got. I got, you know, vomit tongue. No, just you know your dreams. You can't be I know it to me. I'm just can't be assaulted for having a dream. I guess you could, but that's not a very nice wife. That give me my dream time. I'm going to sleep. I'm donna sleeper right now. Let's pull out with the keyto acidosis. Man, okay, so chuck when you have um, when you eat onions, when you have garlicen and food particles, all this stuff that's normal bad breath stuff. There's also other things, metabolic things often that can give you, like a a different type of breath. It may or may not be bad. One bad one is if you have liver problems, you're liver shutting down, you're gonna have what's called mousey breath. Can you imagine what mousey breath smells like? Like? Apparently your breath smells like live writhing mice, mousey breath. I can't think of what else it would denote. I don't know what a mouse smells like. Uh sure, I mean, have you ever smelled like a rodent cage? Yeah? But they smell like cedar and poop? Is that what it smells like? That's what they mean a cedar? Uh So it is keto acidosis, the the no carbon effect. Yeah, okay, Yeah, that is something that will warn you about if you're trying to attain what's known as ketosis with like an apkins type diet um. Some people, when they are reached that blissful level of fat burning, it also takes their it's toll on their their mouth and their breath. Yeah, it's like a fruity, acid tony smell. Okay, that sounds better than mousey. Yeah, it's it's gonna better than yeah. Yeah, when you're in keytosis, you when you deprive your body of carbohydrates, it doesn't have that energy to burn right there, so it starts turning inward and going after your fat stores. And when the body burns store fat, keytnes are what is released as energy or burned as energy. And this, yeah, it's the smell from burning keytones is what gives you that fruity breath. Yeah. I've seen websites, you know that they now have the articles. Of course, if you're if this is the diet you want, this is how you can help yourself. And one of the things us always eat bread. It's like, yeah, but all of a sudden, you're not on that diet. Yeah, so that's no solution. Yeah, you can get knocked that of quitos is pretty easy. I'm sure. Yeah, I think eating bread would do. Uh well, I guess we should talk about um after a message break maybe how you can help yourself out if you have plitosis. All right, so let's say you are sadly just one of those people that just has that funky breath one in four right, Yeah, if you're among that, it does seem high. Yeah doesn't. And that's like chronic halitosis, right yeah, where it's not just like you know, brushing your teeth isn't gonna do the trick. Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a fact brought to us by the Listerine company. It might be, but like I said, maybe um of those people are really trying their hardest so you don't notice it, and other people are just smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee all day, which is a bad combination. Yeah, it's pretty bad combinations. Does somehow they become greater than the sum of their party, you know? Yeah, but that's uh, that's breakfast for college students, you know. Cigarettes. So what do you do if you're if you're gonna battle this stuff, if it's more than just something like just a breath mant can handle what's going to happen here? Well, the breath mant just good thing to mention that that can provide a little temporary relief, but it's just masking the funk underneath. Right. She's really not gonna get very far as a solution, No, because all it's doing is creating the sensation of freshness in your mouth. Yeah, because it I get I don't know what breath mints do. Have frequently wondered, like, what is like um um mental do does that open up your pores? So like the air feels colder and fresher? Oh, I don't know, Like what creates that sensation? You don't know? That sounds like a don't be dumb episode to me, but I think it might be. Um. What you want to do is get to the root of the problem, which is at bacteria and uh, like we said, food particles in your teeth um is a big cause. So brushing and flossing and the old tongue scraper and brushing the back of the tongue you scrape the tongue. Doesn't that make you gag? No, it doesn't bother me. I've gotten used to it. I mean, you know, occasionally, if I overreached, that might be a little but I'm not like retching in the bathroom every morning. I think we should keep a webcam in your bathroom when you're getting ready, just to catch those times that you do just make a comple vine compilation hilarious. Uh So attacking the source of the food particles, and you know, I have the fake tooth now, so I have to be extra careful to really brush along there because why I think it would be like they've made it out of some new super polymer that like reflects bacteria. Now that the tooth itself is not the source, but it's um. You know where it meets the gum is not a natural tooth. So yeah, I just have to like really brush the crap out of that area. My gum, you get the crap out. I don't use mouthwash that which is interesting. No toothpaste, well apparently, um it's not necessarily and plenty of mouthwash is a suggestion for this um, specifically types that contain according to the British Medical Journal, uh, chloro hexadrine glucinate, chlora hexadrine glucinate or what you want, because they kill bacteria. I take issue with this. Yeah, one of the main functions of mouthwash isn't to just go in and kill bacteria. Although most mouthwashers do that. Um, it's the swishing action loosens food particles and gets them out from in between your teeth. What I'm saying is you don't necessarily need to use a mouthwash that kills bacteria because you kind of want healthy bacteria. You want what's called the um uh an oral ecosystem in your healthy oral ecosystem or ecology in your mouth uh you want remember remember the poop Shake episode, the poop transplant vehical transplant episode, we ended up talking about the microbiome and how important it is to humanityature same thing with our mouth. Yeah, you don't want to kill all that bacteria now, And there's plenty of bacteria that causes problems, like Streptococcus mutans is what gives us cavities. But there's also plenty of beneficial bacteria where you would have a mouthful of dead skin cells all over your tongue if it weren't for this helpful bacteria breaking the stuff down. It's your problem. Everybody wants to kill bacteria. That's not necessarily a good thing. As a matter of fact, I think we're learning more and more that it's not a good thing. So I say avoid the mouthwash that kills bacteria and just use some sort of mouthwash that maybe has a minty flavor, but it's just really just swishing the food particles out and getting rid of the bacteria's food that's creating their stinky sulfur ducks. Yes, exactly, um. And because getting rid of the food is a big part of it, I would suggest brushing your teeth after lunch too, you know, like don't make it just when you get up and before you go to bed. I say, go for three times a day. Whoa man who has time for that? Everybody? Another good trick is to drink a lot of water. Um. But you know, just keeping your mouth hydrated daily basis is gonna help. You said that saliva is like a natural mouth wash. Water helps. It does the same thing, loosens food particles, gets rid of dead skin cells. In the back of your tongue apparently is like ground zero for it. Like I think there's like twenty times more bacteria there than elsewhere because it's like this bumpy surface that's out of the way of all this other stuff, So things really stick and accumulate back there. So that's the that's an area you want to target. Apparently with the tongue scraper. Yeah, and you could just brush it as well. I do both. But if you are a grown adult and you're not either brushing your tongue or using a tongue scraper, then you're not doing it right. Is that right? Yeah, somebody needs to teach you. I give a quick part of a quick you know, brush with with my toothbrush over my tongue. But I worry about killing taste buds like I love tasting things. You're not gonna kill any taste buds. Sure you can kill taste buds with that. Uh, well, I haven't killed any. Are you sure? Think about what kind of a super taster you could be without your scraper? No, I do worry about that. I'm kind of like, I'd rather have low level bad breath and be able to taste great stuff then have no bad breath whatsoever and not be able to taste I would rather have no bad breath and still taste everything. Well, yeah, that's the holy grail. What kind of like flim flam world? Are you living it? It's called Chuck's life. It's nice, it's nice. If none of this stuff works for you, you you may have a problem. Like you might want to go see a dentist, uh, and maybe even a doctor. Well, yeah, the dentist might say, yeah, I go the doctor you have a mousey breath, which means your liver shutting down, and find a new dentist. You know, there's a smell test that they do that dennists do. Yeah, what they'll do is still say, Okay, this is gonna be gross, but I want you to breathe through your mouth and I'm going to sniff close to your mouth. And then they say, okay, now I want you to breathe through your nose and I'm gonna sniff close to your nose, and they can determine whether it's a nasal and like a problem in your nasal cavity, I can give you bad breath, you can have stinking sinuses, so gross, or if it's in your mouth, and then they can further to do like yeah, if it's not dentist doing this, yeah, and if it's in your if it's coming through your nose, it's suggests possibly not just your sinuses, but it could be pulmonary to like you could have some sort of lung problem that's creating gases that stink and they're coming out of your nose rather than your mouth. So I guess they train you to do that indental school. Huh. I guess i'd have to. That's not a very popular day, you know, everybody pair up. Oh my god, and there's the one guy in the corner like eating a sandwich, Like, what can I give a two more tips? Please get ten more if you eat a crunchy breakfast like granola, cereal or something like that, Okay, it's going to clear out a lot of the gunk from the night before. You just want to make sure you get rid of all those food particles afterwards. And then if you're interested in a mouth wash that is not antibacterial really certainly Yeah. Uh it's you take a half a cup of warm water and eighth of a teaspoon of cinnamon and one teaspoon of honey, swirl all together and uh, swish it around and gargle it. That's like um, like old timey mouthwash apparently. Yeah, and we could probably recommend apple cider vinegar just for anything that's like the wonder the wonder liquid. It seems like, dude, I was once on my way to a full blown kidney or um, maybe urinary your urinary infection, some bladder infected. Something was going on, and it was starting to go downhill fast, and you muse, like drink this and drink a lot of it. And I started drinking apple cider vinegar and like raw cranberry juice, like the real cranberry juice. UM over like about an eight to twelve hour period, like really hit it and um gone, and like it was happening, like that happening was going on, and like I afforded it. He stopped the happening. I do a shot every morning now of apple cider vinegar, and don't get the just the stuff in the store that you you should be cooking and cleaning with. There's the I can't remember the brand, but there's the the super potable one, but the one that, yeah, the one that that you'll find it a health food store. Yeah, I can't remember the name of it. But there's like one brand that everyone goes to, and it's it's tough. Man. If you ever just do a straight shot of it without deluding it, it's hardcore. Yeah. Yeah. Everything I was doing was taking maybe a shot and then deluding it in like eight ounces of water and it's still very difficult. Yeah, you can do it though, especially when you're fighting off some sort of infection. Yeah, and you want to brush your teeth after that, because scs just brush your teeth all the time. Uh. If you want to learn more about halitosis, I don't know what more you could possibly learn, but you can try. You can type that word into the search part how stuff works dot com and it will bring up this article. And since I said search parts, time for a listener. Ma'm We're gonna address our April Fool's prank officially here with this one. Um. I want to say, first of all, Josh, you and Ben. I was blown away by the performance. You guys sold it so hard like and we just threw it together. We were like, hey, let's just try. It wasn't some big plot. We there's no practice plan for weeks and weeks like, hey, maybe we should do an Apri Fool's joke this year. And I said, hey, maybe I quit the show and Ben took my place, and you guys just waned it and like nailed it. Man. I was sitting here beside you and I felt like I was watching my own funeral. Yeah, it's weird. Yeah. You kept going like cut, cut, stop, stop, and we're like, no, we have to press on. So we're not jokesters typically, but it was I think it was the only one to be released on April Fools Day. Was the first time we had the opportunity to release one on April Fools and look out two years from now, because that'll be a yeah yeah. But if we do like Josh left the show, everyone be like no, no, no, or they'll be expecting that yeah, and we'll do it and they'll be like, well, wait a minute, they thought that. I would think that, you know, maybe we could give you like I don't know, you could have a heart attack on the show or something. Uh. But anyway, we got an outpouring of people because I was dead or missing. I know, people really really reacted to that. Like a lot of people said they didn't realize how much they needed you until well we're gone. And yeah, there were plenty of people who said, like Josh, I pit had been you, I would have felt the same way. But um well I got to play the martyr. I got the plumb roll. It was nice. It's like I got had to do nothing and just get showered with actualation, but it was it was very neat to see, like people were like, never leave, don't ever do that again, and it was pretty cool. Actually yeah, and also I want to say I'm a half of Ben. He asked us to to let everybody know whenever we could that he actually was purposely sounding terrible. What he was doing. He like that was play acting. Yeah. Yeah. The whole point was like we wanted it to be super awkward, right, I think you guys achieved that. Okay, So so go ahead, back from the dead Chuck. So this from Matt from Athens or Joe, Uh go dogs. Hey guys, my girlfriend I have been listeners for years. I didn't realize just how important the show was to us though, until your April fools Day show. I had listened to the episode before she did, and he didn't even tell her. That's kind of mean. And I was keen on setting her up for the gag, so I sat it out in the kitchen table and told her that, uh stuff you should know at some big news. I knew she'd be sucked into the prank, but was not prepared for what happened next. She started to cry and denounced the show with one of you gone, saying she would stop listening. She was worried about Chuck. I even had people are worried about Emily. They were like they thought Emily was in the hospital. Chuck started um. She said she would stop listening and was worried about Chuck and started tossing out possible explanations like the best of conspiracy theorists. She was so sad that I had to fast forward to the reveal. After her surprising yet pretty cute reaction, I was hoping to swap out her emotional connection for a birthday shout out. She's a contemporary dancer and uses the id is in your podcast and her classes in choreography. I think dances about Alan Turning. I gotta see this. Yeah, it's crazy. I ad met this pretty crass way of getting a happy birthday, but I think it's worth a shot. So, Matt, you didn't tell us your girlfriend's name, So we're just gonna say happy birthday to Matt's girlfriend from Athens. Happy birthday Matt's girlfriend. I'm gonna guess the Jennifer Matt enjoy sleeping on the couch this evening. You know, we fooled some of our friends even Joe and Dazzo texted me and said, you guys actually fooled me for about eight seconds. Is that right? Yeah? Yeah, we got a lot of people who said, like, I didn't fall for anything all day, and the only people who got me the stuff. You should know it's because you guys like destroyed it and then the one with me for a minute, I thought I was off the show. Have to leave. The ones that I felt bad about though, we're the ones who listened to it like after April one. Yeah, yeah, and we're like Australia. Yeah, and they didn't realize it was the it was yeah exactly. But yes, so everyone, thank you very much for the outpouring of emotion. We both feel very loved. Yeah, it's it's sure. I mean, we know people like the show, but when you hear stuff like that, it's like a while. Yeah, gonna depend on this and uh, we know now that we're not allowed to ever leave. Nope, it's well go out in a murder suicide if anything. Cool agreed, So if you guys love us so much, you can hang out with us outside of the podcast too. On social media.
