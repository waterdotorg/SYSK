Josh: Hey, everybody, it's Josh and Chuck your friends, and we are here to tell you about our upcoming book that's coming out this fall, the first ever Stuff you Should Know book, Chuck. That's right. What's the cool, super cool title we came up with. It's Stuff you Should Know colon, an incomplete compendium of mostly interesting things. That's right, and it's coming along so great. We're super excited, you guys. The illustrations are amazing, and there's the look of the book. It's all just it's exactly what we hoped it would be. And we cannot wait for you to get your hands on it. Yes, we can't. Um and you don't have to wait. Actually, well you do have to wait, but you don't have to wait to order. You can go pre order the book right now everywhere you get books, and you will eventually get a special gift for pre ordering, which we're working on right now. That's right, So check it out soon coming this fall. Welcome to Stuff you Should Know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Chuck, Jane Chucker Bryant, and this is stuff you should know, the super gross, but I love it. Addition, uh, big time trigger warning for people. This is about tape worms. It is disgusting and super creepy and gross, and I knew that you would love it. It's so great, it's so great. It's just so crazy. We're going all the way. Baby. The word perianus comes up at least once, and not in a good way. Oh man, Perry As he was a good guy. He was that's I've ever had was Oh he was? Was he? Uh? Was he the one who who made himself everybody's secret saying every year that's right, you know, old perry Anus uh down on him and he would he would sign his name perianus parentheses saw ari. Uh. Well, if you don't know what perenus is, just buckle up, because, like you said, Chuck, it's going to be quite a ride because we are talking about tape worms, and we're not talking just about tape worms. We're talking about the idea of taking a tapeworm, ingesting it, and letting it live and grow in your body and the hopes that it will uh divert enough nutrients and calories away from you that you can just eat whatever you want and lose weight at the same time because you're not getting fatter. The tapeworm is right, but we're mainly just talking about tape worms because well, I don't want to issue a spoiler this really seriously, We'll save that for Act three. So tape worms. Uh. This is from our old house stuff works dot com website, which is nice to find one of these. It is a little hidden gym hanging out. This is a grab store article, originally just hidden in the anus, waiting for us to discover it. That's right. Actually it crawled its way out and dropped it at my feet. So tapeworms. The very first line of this article is a tapeworm is like something out of a horror movie, and it really is. It is this wormy, little ribbon shaped creature that is a parasite in every sense of the word. They can be very big. It can be as big as eighty ft long, and they can live in a host for up to thirty years. Yeah. Like, you could get a tapeworm as a kid, and that thing might be with you through every formative experience you've ever had, and you might actually be sad when it calls out of your anus and detaches itself from you. That sounds like a Simpsons episode or something kind of Yeah, maybe a little more like um Cleveland show. Um. The good news is, uh, if you don't live in a developing nation, then you probably don't need to worry about a tapeworm, although it can still happen, to be sure, but with good hygiene, good hand washing, good livestock practices, and good um just feak overall fecal and food handling practices, it's not likely to be an issue with you. Yeah, great practice livestock, great practice everybody. Yeah, So if you are in the developing world, Um, you there is a good chance that you can get a tapeworm because in some cases, uh, sanitation is not as great as you would like it to be, and there's more poop hanging around than then there should be, or that there there could be considering other modern practices. And then even beyond that, um, there's a lot more living among livestock then there are, and say like developed urban areas. Right, so even in the developed world, there there if you go outside of the urban areas and you start running up against pigs and cows and their poop and stuff like that, um, you can conceivably catch the tapeworm fairly easily, especially if you're not really big into hand washing, sure, which you should be if you're around poop from animals or humans or any kind of poop. Yeah, just any time there's even any kind of coincidence of poop in your hands, even possibly, just take twenty seconds, recite the alphabet, and wash your hands, because if you don't, you might get some of that fecal material in your mouth and a board that fecal material can be um tapeworm eggs, and that is how you get a tapeworm infection. One way. In the developed world, you're much more likely to get it from something like eating undercooked meat. Right. I've never even had pink eye. Oh really never. It's not a pleasant experience. Chunk, all right, pop, Yeah, I got some FeCO material in my own eye a couple of times, I guess poop by the sailor man. Yeah, Like I was sniffing my fingers and I guess I got too close to my eye. Then you got your nose confused with your eyeball right again, Right, I had a little itch and I was like, oh no, what have I done? And it was too late. So parasites, like I said, A tapeworms, like I said, are true parasites. Um. Everything that it gets that it needs it gets from its host, right, and like that's how it lives. Man. It just it is, like you said, a true parasite in that, like all those things that you're supposed to be getting from the food you eat, some of it is being diverted by to the tapeworm um and they absorb nutrients like gangbusters. They actually don't have a mouth, which is weird because it looks like they have several mouths, but they actually use those mouths to hang onto your intestines inside so that they don't get flushed out by the paristalic action that you know, helps move poop and stuff along your intestines, and instead the tapewormage is kind of floating there absorbing nutrients in the matrix of your gut juices basically, and they absorb it. They absorb it through their skin um and they're just really good at it, so much so that there's at least one type of uh tapeworm out there that you can actually get from eating undercooked fish pike specifically. That's so good at absorbing B twelve. It can outcompete you it's host, and you can get a pretty bad vitamin B twelve deficiency as a result. Do so, these tapeworms live in uh all kinds of host animals, like they could you could be you or me. It could be, like you said, a fish, which is pretty surprising. Um. Most often you hear about beef and pigs or cow. I guess it's the animal and pigs. Uh. But they you know, depending what kind of species it is, it might have a preference for a kind of host. And I guess we should describe the body of this thing right now. It's it's pretty gross. It's got a a head. I guess you would call it. I call it the skull X. Yeah, it's called the skull ax skull X. It's the top of the worm what we as humans might call a head. Yeah, but it looks like an old timey diving head diving helmet, you know what I mean. It's it's round, it's got those suckers, so they look like kind of the portholes on the old div diving helmet. Um. And those again, those suckers, they look like mouths that the thing would eat on, but no, they use it to suck onto the sides of your intestine. But at the top of the head um there are some hooks, like a ring of hooks that actually latch onto the like really grip onto the side of your intestinal wall, so that that tapeworm, once it gets its hooks and it suckers into your intestinal wall, it's not going anywhere. You know, we should bring back the term skin diver. Sure you remember that skin diver. Yeah, wasn't that like a snorkeling. I think snorkeling or maybe even scuba is just such an antiquated term, like nobody uses that anymore, No, I know, because it makes no sense now, and it's possible it never made any sense. Like I could see someone's granddad now saying, you know, I'm gonna get certified to be a skin diver, right, and then we're gonna get me some pearls, and all the kids laughing Grandpa, No one's his skin diver, right, And Grandpa was probably saying a bunch of other stuff. Nobody says anymore to you know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. So we're bringing skin diver back. What was the last thing you said something about the skull X. I said that once this thing gets his hooks and it's uh, it's suckers into your intestinal wall, it's not going anywhere. Yeah, like a good catchy tune. Yeah, like it your tape worm. So if it wasn't for the skull x, uh, this article points out, you know, the skull eos is the problem. If it wasn't for this thing, that your intestines would just churn it out and you'd poop it out, no problem. But the skull X is really where the rubber meets the road as far as attaching to your body and that need to think that paristalic action I was talking about, Like, that's just a bunch of like quivering muscles that move in a progressive direction towards your your rectum and anus and all that that push like poop out through your intestines or push nutrients through and where they absorbed. But then it ultimately like pushes the poop out um. And that's how the whole thing works. It's just like some quivering muscles in there. And I read Chuck that if you take a stimulant um laxative, that that's actually what it does is it really kind of um energizes and makes those muscles contract, which is good on the one hand because it really works. But on the other and it's bad because your body becomes dependent on those things really quickly. So you don't want to just take those willy nilly from what I saw. You want to try just about every other type of laxative there is. First starting with a diet high and insoluble fiber, and then work your way on up to where you're talking to a doctor or a nurse practitioner or something before you're hitting those those um stimulant laxatives. Yeah, I think the word laxative it's sort of is backward because it it makes it sound like it's relaxing everything, when in fact it's making everything work harder. It's pretty interesting. It's all upside down and dipsy do. But I'll tell you what. There's a bunch of signs along the way that say one way, one way, everybody. You're going this way whether you like it or not. Right, So, the sculex is the is, like I said, where you're you're sticking to the intestine, and then below the skull x is the neck and and the rest of it is, I mean from the neck down, it's just sort of the same thing. There are all these uh, just individual segments, can be thousands of them, at least hundreds, called the strobilla, and each segment by its own is known as a pro glatted And those are like when you look at a tapeworm and it just looks like a piece of like segmented tampe tape. Those those little segments, those proglottids. I I did not know this at all, but there they're they're basically reproductive organs that also contain eggs, and that the ones closest to the head are male sperm sacks. And then as you get further away from the head, those proglottids um become female and egg holding, and that under under some circumstances with some species of tapeworms, they can sell um, fertilize and and basically we produced themselves, right, But more often than not, they're they're just kind of exchanging sperm and eggs with nearby neighbors who are again floating around in your intestines, absorbing nutrients and just sperming and egging everywhere inside your gut. Yeah, and you're just sitting there watching Jeopardy and it might be eighty ft long and thirty years old. You're just you have no idea what's going on. Like your gut maybe infested with tape worms right now, and you probably you might not know. Yeah, isn't that creepy? It is super creepy. Yeah, all right, let's take a break and I gotta I'm gonna go wash my hands again, and we'll talk more about these proglottics right after this. Well, now, when you're on the road driving in your truck, want to learn a thing or two from Josh Man Chuck stuff you should know? All right, okay, Chuck, so you promise more purglotted talk laid on us. Yeah, So these purglotteds can um like the tapeworm is hardy, but it can also break apart. It'll still be alive, like make no mistake, Like like a chameleon's tail. It's no big whoop if some of these purglottis break off and they'll just come out of your poop. And you might look at your stool and see these things and say like, wow, I have a tape worm. Thank goodness, I got rid of it. But don't be fooled. There might be a lot of tapeworms still back up in your body. Yeah, because remember up towards the neck is sperm. Down lower along the body is um eggs, and then the lower you get our fertilized eggs. So when those proglotteds break off towards the end and make their way out in your poop um, they are they're fully fertilized egg sacs and that's how they enter the environment. It's all part of the life cycle. The proglottis breaking off and making its way out of your anus. By the way, proglottids are spectacular in that not only are they segments filled with fertilized egg sax by the time they break off and leave you, they also contain muscles, meaning that they can walk on their own. So these little segments of tapeworm filled with fertilized tapeworm eggs can move and crawl their way out of your butt, so much so that there's something called discharge of the proglottids, which um is when when right when totally I was gonna say that is so progressive, it's crazy, But when they start marching their way out of your butt, you have a there's a crawling sensation arianus um, and that this is one reason why dogs with tapeworms but scooch, and also why you might butt scooch too, because you are trying to erase the the very anus from your body to get rid of this crawling sensation. For sure. But even if they don't crawl right out of your bottom um, they they can still make their way out in your poop, and then they crawl away from the poop. Because if they crawl away from the poop, and say, like a pasture right where some human is just pooped, there might be a cow nearby that eats the grass that this periglotted has broken open and like deposited the eggs into the soil. And when that cow eats those eggs, this life cycle starts all over again. You know what we call that dog scooch in our house the boot scooting boogie. That's whenever you see the boot scooting boogie happen in your house. It may not meet a tape worm, but there it's not good. No um. Little Moe does it sometimes, but she does this cute thing where she does a little one eight in one place. She doesn't go like, she doesn't make a line, she stays and just kind of does like the twist, and she eventually bores a hole in the floor and falls through to another dimension. That's right. Yeah, the boot scooting boogie also could be like anal glands that need expressing, or just uh dingle berry that needs taken care of board on a Saturday night. But it's never something awesome. It's never you know, hundred dollar bills or just a dog that's like making some cool noise with their butt, right exactly. So man, Yeah, so the this life cycle thing that just kicked off again, we should follow this through one more time. Okay, I don't actually I don't even know if we've gone through this. But the thing about tape worms, and you kind of touched on it before, is they infest different animals, But the same kind of tape worm might infest different animals as part of its life cycle. Right, So, like when you just pooped in the cow pasture and that purglotted opened up in deposited the eggs into the soil, and this cow eating grass ate that soil. Those eggs went into that cow and they said, okay, time to turn into our larval stage, and in the cow they turned into larvae. But the larvae of tape worms form like a cyst around them, and from what I can gather, the reason that they form the cyst is because they um. It prevents them from setting off an immune response. Because, like you were saying, you can have a tapeworom infection unless it's really bad and you're becoming really malnourished as a result. UM, and it's a it's an adult tapew room in your gut. You may never know that you had one until the thing just falls out of your bottom one day, like it's done um or you start, you know, discharging purglotted in your stool. The same thing with cows, like when they become infested with um tapeworm larvae in these cysts forms, the cysts burrow their way out of the intestinal wall and then just implant themselves in the cows muscles don't seem to really provide any kind of discomfort or problem, and again they don't sit off an immune response. But the reason that they deposit themselves in their muscles is because somewhere along their evolutionary history, which from what we've seen and goes back at least two seventy million years. They figured out that the animals eat the muscles of other animals, and so we come along and we eat the muscles of the cows, and those cysts, those larval cysts of tapeworms deposit into our guts and they mature into the adult tapeworm, so that the whole life cycle begins again. Yeah, what these uh at the larval stage, what they're trying to do. They're trying to get to the bloodstream, right, So like if you eat eggs or whatever, then the they will become those syste the larval's and then they go into the blood stream. Right, that's right. Okay, So if you have this, uh, if you have the tapeworm, then you haven't an infection known as human tenise. Uh a man, I had it. I even spelled it out tiny assis, Is that right? I think? So that's how I was gonna say it. And if you have that, like it's like you said, it's not a big deal. It's asymptomatic probably and you won't even know you've got it, but that can develop into sisters yarcosis, and that is when these things get into your blood stream, and that is not a good thing because the chain reaction that can happen from here is pretty bad. I mean, it can lead to death. It usually doesn't. But they can be anywhere in your body. Uh, they can grow, and they can inflame tissue. So if it's putting pressure, like near your eyeball, it can cause temporary blindness or permanent blindness. If it's near your brain, that's no good. It can cause brain damage and uh. In fact, in some UH countries they think it's the main cause for adult onset onset seizure. Isn't that crazy? Yeah? Yeah, I saw that. There's there's one guy it's called neurocystic or kosis, and this one doctor says that at least five million cases of adult onset um seizures worldwide or from having tapeworm cysts in your brain. So that that was the appropriate response, chuck. So the thing is like, when you eat a tapeworm larva um, it becomes an adult tapeworm in your gut. Humans aren't our bodies aren't set up or they're not in this kind of symbiosis with tapeworm eggs to do the same thing. So if we eat tapeworm eggs accidentally then those become those cystic larva's larva, and then that's that's what travels into our bloodstream and causes all of these problems. And there's specifically one kind of pig tape worm that it goes through its life cycle from pig to human to pig, and under normal circumstances, if we undercooked pork and get those larva, they're going to turn into adult tape worms. But if we undercooked pork and we accidentally eat some eggs from that pork, then that's when that cistic or cosis. Is that right, Yes, sistic or cosis. It can be a real problem that you will know, like you were saying that you've got a tape worm problem pretty pretty quick. Yeah. If they get big, they can block your your ducks, your pancreatic ducks, your bile ducks. Uh, they can get in your organs and grow within your organs, which is something that should keep you awake at night. Uh. If they get large enough in your organs that that's gonna like those organs are not going to be good for very long. Uh. They can rupture sometimes. Um. And this is just in the body, not necessarily in the organs, but if it ruptures in your body, then it's your Your body is gonna out like an immuno response. You're gonna get hives, it's gonna itch uh, it's gonna swell, and you're just gonna have like this massive allergic reaction. You're gonna be like what bug bit me, right, except you won't be able to talk because your throat will have closed. Perhaps, so chuck um. If you don't want a tapeworm, which hopefully by now you've realized you don't want a tapeworm again, in the in the developed world, it's not that hard to avoid a tapeworm, and in the United States in particular, um like the meat packing industry is I mean, it's dirty and gross and horrific, but it's actually pretty good at spotting things like tapeworms. So there's a really low chance that you're going to get your hands on meat from an American grocery store that has tapeworm cists in it. Right, probably not going to get a tapeworm, but just to be sure, the government has very um conscientiously recommended some minimum king temperatures for things like whole cuts of meat like a chopp or a steak, right. I think it used to be one sixty fairret height. Now they've lowered it to something like one, which is sixty three degrees celsius. And here's the key. They say, after you've done cooking it to that internal temperature which you want to meet thermometer, Do you have one of those? One of the best things I've ever bought, Chuck. That really up my steak game quite a bit. But the key to a good steak, and apparently to killing tape worms and other parasites, is to letting your whole cut of meat rest for at least three minutes. I always do five after you cook, before you carve it up and start eating. Do you do that? You should do that anyway, because of the flavor and the juices. It just does something amazing. Like, before I started doing that, I was just a schlove. I was a total loser. I had no idea what was going on in the world. Once I started off the grill and put it in your mouth, sure, yeah, basically, I mean put it on a plate and like start eating it right. Once started letting meat rest, it was like a whole new world. Yeah. And here's another tip. If you want a really delicious steak uh or I guess pork chop. You you get one either. I mean, if you don't have one of these um sort of slotted cutting boards for to rest on, use like a baker's rack or something, because you still maintain that crisp on the outer, that char if you just let it sit in its juices, that's gonna get all. You know, it's going to change the texture, oh, like a grilled pan or something like that. Use that. Yeah, I've got this cutting board that has uh it's basically like a grid instead of being flat, uh and it and it has a a little uh like a grill grate that can lift up and out of it so it's never sitting. Like not much of the meat is sitting on a board when it's resting. So you don't want it to rest in its juices. No, I want to keep it crispy. Okay, I didn't know that I got it all. It's to try that because I always just basically I just put it on a plate and throw like a some foil loosely over it, or else like a like a pan cover. You cover it too, huh. Yeah, yeah, I've always read it's gonna keep cooking right. Yeah, yeah, for sure, But I mean it's not on the flame anymore, so it's like just kind of um yeah, yeah, I know. For I've never tried it uncovered. Maybe I will try uncovering and away from the juices and see what happens you try covering it and leaving it in his juices. I don't even use a meat thermometer, so I think we have different steak games. You don't huh do you like, here's rare, medium, rare, medium, rare. But if I know the thickness and the weight and the temperature, I don't need to meet thermometer. I stopped cooking as many steaks, so I have to kind of I had to go back to elementary school again. No, there's no shame in it. I'm not ashamed. I had a had a chef that I worked for that he could he just touched his He like, you can tell the internal what the inside looks like just by touching the outside, right, And we should tell people. They're probably people who haven't been listening that long and don't know the secret to steak that we've said before, Chuck, But you do not touch your steak. You don't cut it, you cook it, you see it on one side for a minute and a half two minutes tops, depending on how thick it is. Flip it over and do the same thing to the other side. And then you take it off of your oven or your grill or whatever and move it into a convection oven if you've got one at about three degrees three minutes, the three and a half minutes per side for six to seven minutes total. Let it rest five minutes, thank us in the morning. I don't do mind that way either. Like I said, we've got different steak games. I thought, I thought you said you'd tried it that way before, and you're like, this is amazing I've done. I'll do all kinds of way. Sometimes I do it in a pan and then stick it in the broiler. These days of all about the grill again, because I've got a grill that can get really really hot. Oh yeah, well that's the key, you know, Like you want to see hear in those juices to keep it from escaping. Yeah, which is another reason to meet. Thermometer is good if you don't, if you can't, just use your thumb. You don't have to cut it open to look inside. You just plunge that thing in there and it tells you. I think all this talk of steak has made people forget that we're talking about tapeworms. Yeah, perryanus tapeworms. So um should we? I mean, I guess we should talk a little bit about the symptoms before we come back for the final act of tapeworms as a weight loss aid. But you might not have infectra I'm sorry symptoms at first. Uh. You might feel a little weak, you might feel some you might have some diarrhea. You might feel dizzy or lose your appetite. You might lose a little weight. You might crave salt, which is an interesting one because I always crave salt. Yeah. I thought that was interesting to um or Pika in general, Like if you crave eating clay or just anything that you is a little weird is a big sign. You're saying Pica now, pa Oh yeah, I think I've always said they haven't I you always said, Pika. This is amazing. It's like starting our podcast all over again after twelve years. It's a refresh. That's what I'm going with now, all right, Uh, So you will get a you will deliver a stool sample. Um. If you go to the doctor, if you suspect you have a tape worm, you want them to ask you for it first. Sure, just don't bring it in a bag unless you've happened to see that your poop has worms in it, um and that you could bring it in. But you could also just say there were those were definitely worms in my poop, and hopefully what happens is is that you've gone in there quickly enough to where it it doesn't end up being a very big deal. And you take a little anti worm medication and this thing works by basically kind of paralyzing the parasite so it's muscles are perm contracted. Yeah, and you know we're talking about how that that head just latches on. It's not able to latch on. It just comes right on out in your poop, I know, because it just falls out, basically. And there are plenty of videos on the internet that show tapeworms that have come out of people's anuses. If you want to go see that kind of thing, they can get really really long. Um. But that that drug chuck that that you're talking about, the anti warming agent, it's the same thing that they give dogs, Like any animal that's going to have a worm is going to get the same treatment. But they found they're pretty sure this particular one, Nick Close amid this d worming agent is actually also good for things like treating cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, graph versus host disease, endometriosis, and a bunch of other stuff. Because they're like, it does something to to channeling pathways, uh, multiple chane only pathways, And it might be like this wonder drug that's just waiting to be unlocked. Didn't that neat? That is super neat, Nick Close to meat? Do we take that break? Yeah? Man, let's take the break, all right. Then we'll get to the big revel revelation relevation, no revelation. Can you use the tape him to lose weight? Right? For this? Well, now we're on the road driving in your truck. Want to learn a thing or two from Josh? Can chuck it stuff? You should know? All right? No, you can't and you shouldn't. That's right. So remember Kelly Kapoor tried that or else she considered taking it. I don't remember, do you. Oh that's right, I forgot about that. So I mean this has been around for a really long time. This idea that you can take a eat a tapeworm of some sort tapeworm cyst, not eggs, because those will turn into system and invade your brain. Um that that you could get a tapeworm infection and start to lose weight. Possibly as long as the nineteen century they think that there. So here's the thing. Do you remember when we did our episode on Flee Circuses. Sure it was really thrilling to me because even while we were podcasting, I still could not tell for a little while whether it was a real thing or just one of the most exquisitely perpetrated hoaxes ever, right, and that it was still working on us. There's this kind of a similar thing where it's not entirely clear if these old timey ads are real people think they typically are, or if they were real, if anybody actually did this, or if it was some sort of farce or hoax or satire. And if it wasn't satire, how widespread was this, Because it does seem that there were nineteenth century ads, late nineteenth century early twenty century adds four sterilized tapeworm pills that women could take. They were marketed toward women to keep their their figure trim. Right. Of course they were marketed toward women take a tapeworm, ladies, exactly. Uh. There was a singer and opera singer named Maria Callas who and this is almost certainly urban legend, but she lost I read eighty pounds I've seen other places sixty pounds over a few months in the mid nineteen fifties, so much so that it affected her singing as an opera singer. And we do know that she got a tapeworm at some point in her life, and we do know that she liked to eat her steak rare. But I think it looks, by and large like it was urban legend, that it got kind of all mixed up together. And people said that Maria Callis lost weight by ingesting tapeworm, right right, Like those two things did happen. She did lose weight, and she did have a tapeworm infection, probably at some point in life, but that the two were in no way related. But based on this kind of idea that you could take a tapeworm and lose weight, that that they became conflated into this urban legend, as you were saying, and that that's that's like the one that people point to is like proof that this actually happened, and actually it didn't, it didn't happen at all like that. Supposedly there is a clinic in Tijuana called worm Therapy uh and supposedly this is the one place in the world where you can go get a tape worm put into your body to lose weight for about bucks. You can get a beef tape worm um. And I've you know, have been to t one a few times. I never sought out worm therapy, but apparently it existed or still exists, it's not clear. So they have a website. I think it's worm Therapy dot com or dot org and it's as you know, like you know, contact form fields. It shows a map of where it is and it isn't to you one and all that there's a phone number. I didn't call the phone number. But it's one of those things like is it actually real number one or is it just a hoax website? If it's not a hoax website and it actually is a helmet therapy because remember in our Hookworms episode, we were talking about that theory that losing some kinds of parasitic worms they think actually harmed our immune system and lead to a rise in like crones and stuff like that. Yeah, so there are clinics out there in the world that use um parasitic worms to help autoimmune diseases. So it's possible that worm therapy does that and that they don't do the beef tapeworm thing. But the urban legend is that they did, at least as as recently as two thousand nine, they offered it. It's just not clear whether any of this is true or not. Right. What we do know is true is that to to purpose do this is not a good idea. It is not a healthy way to lose weight. Uh, and you're not even gonna lose Like it said that you can expect to lose one to two pounds from a tapeworm a week. You can lose that much with a pretty aggressive diet and exercise plan. Yeah, supposedly, just cutting five calories out from your diet every day every week, you could lose a pound. You can look forward to losing a pound. So yeah, exactly taking a tapeworm to do that is not not a good idea, especially considering so because that tapeworm is competing for nutrients from you. You're gonna end up with a pretty nice little case of malnutrition if it gets pretty bad. So you're actually going to be your body is going to talk you into eating more than you normally would, right, so you'll develop even worse eating habits than you did than you have before the tapeworm infection, so that when you finally get around to taking a d worming eight it and it gets rid of that tapeworm, when you just keep eating again, you're gonna gain that weight right back, and you're probably gonna gain more weight back because you've developed even worse seeing eating habits from having the tapeworm. And again, all of this is based on the idea that any of this is even true to begin with, which is totally unclear still at this point. Yes, totally, So that's it. Don't don't take a tapeworm to lose weight. Just exercise and diet. That's that is it. There's no better diet fed than that. Just exercise and diet, and you will lose weight and feel healthier and better and sleep better and have less chronic disease and just be far better off. That's it. That's right. You got anything else, No well, since Chuck said no, it's time for a listener mail. This is from a high school student. We love hearing from high school students. This is from Kate. Kate says, Hi, guys, I am a junior in high school from mass Aitusetts. Discovered the podcast in September at the start of the school year, and I've loved it ever since. It definitely makes my morning car rides much more interesting, and it does wonders to decrease my horrible road rage. Recently, as I was driving to Cape Cod, I was listening to your Spartacus episode. I've been studying Latin since sixth grade, uh and this year was my first year taking Ancient Greeks, so needless to say, I'm a huge nerd when it comes to Roman history. I couldn't help but to laugh when I heard you both struggling to pronounce the names of the Roman consuls and they're important and other important historical figures. This quarantine has really been tough on me, guys, like it has on everyone, and I really needed that laugh. So I thought I would write to you as a sort of thank you note. Although your pronunciation may not have been great, the whole episode really did wonders to lighten my mood and make me feel better even though things are crazy right now. Always I know that I have your podcast to listen to when I'm feeling down or just want to smile out. Wishing you health and happiness. That is from Kate in Massachusetts. Thanks a lot, Kate. That was nice of her to say our pronunciation may not have been great. Yeah, what she means is, guys, you were way off. It was terrible. Well, that was very nice, Kate. And it's nice to hear that we're helping you out there. And uh, thank you for writing in. And if you are like Kate and we're helping you out we always love hearing that kind of thing.
