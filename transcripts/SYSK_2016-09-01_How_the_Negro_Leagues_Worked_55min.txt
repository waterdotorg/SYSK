Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry and there's this Stuff you Should Know Sports the edition Sports. I think really we should air on just the side of history. Well I even put a note in here if you don't like sports, listen to this one anyway. Yeah, because this is about much more than baseball. Yeah, this is about a history and about overcoming adversity. Yeah, like, it's very interesting story because and we'll get into this, but I think people tend to think of the negro leagues, and that's what this is about, the baseball negro leagues, which is what they were called. We don't use that word anymore, but you called this that because that's what it was. Um ethan to think of it in a certain way, which is only Yeah, well, baseball was segregated and they couldn't play in the white leagues, and that's awful, which it is and was, but there's another side to it. Yeah, Yeah, that's a good point where these men and these business owners were empowered and uh and the players and yeah, and it's yeah, that's just a tease. I just wanted to whet their appetite, my appetite. I'm sitting here, like, keep going. So I think we should start with a little bit of history, right, So just a brief primer of American history. We'll start with slavery. It's a good place to start. The transit Atlantic slave trade built this country. And frankly, I'm just gonna come out and say, I think some of the major issues that the United States faces today comes from a lack of accountability for slavery. Um Really, it's contributing to a lot of the inn a quality and a lot of the strife that we still face today and have faced over the decades. So you've got slavery, and then you had the end of slavery. You had the Emancipation Proclamation, which a lot of people say, oh, well that was great. Abraham Lincoln spoke some magic words and freed the slaves and everything was great. Yeah, it was just perfectly equal after that, right. No, So it took the the Union to win the Civil War UM two, begin to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation in the South and in Texas. Apparently Texas were among the last holdouts, and there was slavery going on in Texas like years after the Civil War was over. Yeah, they were just like, he's not going to pay attention to that. So um. The Civil Wars fought. The the part of the the Union victory of the Civil War was coming into the South and saying like, all you Confederate you guys are out of power. And as a matter of fact, this power vacuum is perfectly willing to be filled by um, freed blacks. Uh, so go ahead, run for office, UM, become judges, like, become part of the reconstruction power. UM. And that lasted for a very very short time. The white Southern former power base who were leading the Confederacy and even once who weren't necessarily part of like the actual Confederate government or even the Confederate Army, which just the people like in your town who used to own the sawmill or whatever. That guy came back in power within a couple of years. And the white Southerners who have been supplanted, when they came back into power, they remembered the black people who had tried to take their positions, and so it got ugly. And so rather than having actual legal slavery. It came in other different horrible, pernicious forms which came to be called post reconstruction, the Jim Crow South. Yeah, and boy, we need to do one. I've had it on my list for a while on Jim Crow period. Um about this. First of all, where'd you get this other good, really good article? It's on the Major League Baseball website. Um, in the prehistory section of that one. And this is just to show you the tone of things. In eight fifty seven, there was a Supreme Court Chief Justice, uh Roger Tanney, who, Um, it's funny that the way this writer put it, he said he's campaigning hard for a spot in the American Scum Hall of Fame. Like that's pretty funny. In his official writing, this is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court said, uh, Negroes were so far inferior to whites that they had no rights which a white man was bound to respect. This is the chief Justice of the Supreme Court. I think I need to say that like four more times before it sinks in. That was two or three. This is what was going on despite the Emancipation Proclamation, despite the Fourteenth Amendment. Well that was actually before it that was before that was during the slave the time of slavery. Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, just to excuse that guy. But after after that, despite the amendments to the Constitution, despite all of that, it's it took to the nineteen sixties to even begin the slightest bit of real progress. That's true, not quite true, because the history is littered with people who made advancements. They I don't want to knock that, but in a systemic manner, you're you're right, it wasn't until the sixties. But part of the problem too was and this is a valid point. Uh. Other courts had said, like those is justice. Henry Billings Brown said legislation is powerless to eradicate racial uh instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences. Basically, what he's saying is like, we can create laws, but you're not going to change public's mind by creating laws. You can't like abolish present prejudice. And so if white people think that black people are inferior to him, who are we the ever meant to say otherwise to try maybe and legislate our way out of it. Even so, and I think eighteen ninety six there was a court case called plus e versus Ferguson, and in plus e versus Ferguson, the Supreme Court upheld and legitimized and actually made UM real the segregation that had already been going on UM ever since reconstruction, or ever since the end of reconstruction, the beginning of Jim Crow laws. Right, So, the United States was officially segregated in eight but baseball had actually segregated years before that, but not as far back as people think, And a lot of people think that baseball had always been segregated up until nineteen forty six. I think Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. I think people think that Jackie Robinson was the first black American to play baseball, including me until yesterday when we started. Yeah, oh, did you know this already? Yeah? I mean I'm a big baseball fan and a bit of a student of its history, so I knew. Okay, So tell him, Chuck Well, uh, who the guys were specifically? Well? Yeah, so in eighteen sixty seven, I think, two years after the Civil War, there was already baseball. Remember Avner double Day created baseball eighteen thirty nine, and that's but that's a legitimate story, right, that's not like he really did. He was the inventor of baseball and it did happen in Cooperstown, New York and all that, right, Yeah, Okay, I don't know, but it was he in Cooperstown. Well that makes sense. So within uh, just a couple of decades there was the National Association of Baseball Players. They were the league, right, yeah, I mean not within a couple of decades. A couple of years. Yeah, like literally two years after the end of the Civil War. That was an African American team called I actually don't know what their name was, but they were out of Philadelphia and they we want to join your league, which was the National Association of Baseball Players at the time, and they were rejected as a team of course at the time. And uh, but that didn't mean that there were not players individually. That's a huge caveat. Yeah, it was a little bit later in six finally and not for too long. We had two brothers, h Moses Fleetwood Walker and well day Walker and uh mostly they played for the Toledo Blue Stuff. That's right, baby, my hometown integrated baseball team in the eighties. You were totally right, Uh, Moses was he was older. He played forty two games for the team. Well, they only came along and played in six games. Moses hit two sixty three that season. Uh. And they were the son of a physician, like the first black physician in Toledo, and um went to college played baseball at ober Only and then Michigan. So I know the Wolverines. I didn't know Oberlin even had sports. Well, this is the nineteenth century. I think they phased the mount fased the Mountain favor of debate, acoustic guitars and debate. I know a lot of people that went to Oberlin weirdly really well, my good friend Robert Shahadi from Boston that you met, that came to our show, Uh, Lucy waynewright to Oberlin. David Reese really went to Oberlin. And I feel like a couple of other people. Yeah, it's got a nice reputation. Yeah, great name too. It sounds ivy league, Yeah, Oberlin the sound of quality. Oberlin sounds ivy league ish. That's on their t shirts. Although we do need to give a shout out. There was one guy in eighteen seventy nine, William Edward White, who substituted and played one game. Who was officially and this is a little murky history wise, because we don't know much about him him or how it happened. But supposedly he played one game as a professional baseball player as a black man. Is that right? And this is when? Okay, So the Walker brothers are playing for Toledo in eighteen eighty six, right, And actually this article on how stuff works gets it wrong. Says that, um, they just played for the team for one year before the team went under. Um, that's not the case. As a matter of fact, the Moses Walker they may have only played together on the team for that one year. Moses Walker had played for years before them. And actually Moses Walker and um, there were several other players at the time in eight and eighties seven, there at least four black players in the Miners. But the Walker brothers were playing for Toledo, which was a major league team. Right, Um, But the presence of Moses Walker actually brought to the four this kind of simmering resentment, Um, and kind of the big elephant in the room. There's a black guy in your team. What are you guys doing? And so Toledo actually went to go play the White Sox in Chicago, and the White Sox had this like they're great player of of that season I think in eight four cap Anson great nicknames back then. So cap Anson said he said some horrible things and ultimately was like, I'm not playing if Batman's on the field, and um, Moses Walker was actually injured and still was like, oh, well, I'm definitely going on the field today anyway, So he dressed out and um, I'm not sure if he actually played in the game, but he was like part of the team and cap Anson was not indulged. Toledo was like, we're not taking our guy out. He's one of our players. So cap Anson can go suck an egg. And cap Anson went and sucked an egg. He was really mad. But um, the the issue that day, that dispute at Comiskey Field, UM brought to the four that the the concept of integrade and ultimately segregation among Major League Baseball teams, and it actually increased the pressure among owners and managers to to get rid of the black players, not just in the majors, but in the minors. There was another player too, I read another story about and we'll we'll get to Roy Campanella. He was a he was better than Jackie Robinson at the time, a catcher who was just amazing Hall of Famer, and he had ah there was a white picture. It was like, you know, he was a great catcher, but I didn't want to play with him, so I would when I pitched to him, I would just ignore his signs and through whatever I want, like, to his own detriment and to the team's detriment. He uh, he just wouldn't take the signs. Career sabotage essentially. I don't think he lasted long either. And Campanella's in the Hall of Fame, So write the other guy who knows. I want to give these names all out though. The four black men in the Miners in eighteen sixty six, besides Moses Walker, we had Bud Fowler, Frank Grant, and George Stovey. And as far as I'm concerned, all these dudes are American heroes. So um, all of a sudden, they succumbed to pressure in eighteen ninety after hate mail and death threats to the coaches and managers and umpires and uh, you know, basically everybody, the players themselves, and they said, you know what, we're going to shut it down as officially in eighteen ninety, we can no longer have any black men in our league. So here's the thing. They never officially did that. They had the minor league band black players way into the major well, and it was never on the rule books either. It was it was an unofficial, non gentleman's agreement because which actually when it was broken, it wasn't like a rule was broken. It was just an unwritten rule, right exactly, which paved the way for answer Ricky to break that unbroken rule without actually breaking a rule. Yes, yeah, good point, Chuck, you want to take a break. Uh yeah, let's do it all right, man. So eighteen ninety, it's now there are there are no black players resegregated in Major league baseball or minor league baseball in America, right, that's right. That actually paved the way for one of the great unsung chapters in baseball history, which was the creation of the Negro leagues. Yeah, in a in a true show of American spirit and determination, and I just love the the game. Uh. These uh, these men got together, they formed their own teams, and they did what's called barnstorming, which is pretty awesome. They would load up in cars on a bus and they would go from town to town and take their show on the road and they would get a game up wherever they could and wherever people would pay a couple of pennies to come watch a baseball game. Um, they were playing white players and these barn storming games or black players or Latino players. Uh yeah, because that's a definite overlook segment of the early baseball history, or Latino players. And one of the cool things about the Negro leagues is they were integrated. They had they had Latino teams like the Cuban Kings out of New York, I believe, and one white guy. All right, so barn storming is going on. Like I said, they would roll into town, they would play whatever teams they could play, and uh, it started to gain some momentum, Like people started to follow these players. They actually got fans. And there was a former player named Andrew Rube Foster who owned to those teams, and he said, you know what, I think we need our own league. They won't let us in their league. Let's start around because besides the fact that people want it, there's money to be made here. Yeah. And as a matter of fact, So this barn storming thing, I want to talk a little more about that, right, Um, one of the reasons barnes storming came about was to make ends meet, but it was also because these teams had to figure out a way to put on games as cheaply as possible. All of the stadiums at the time were owned by whites, and the whites apparently were not very friendly to the idea of black black teams playing in their their fields. So if it were just like black teams playing one another, the white owners of the fields are just charged and exorbitant amounts. These guys were going basically anywhere they could find a place that would stand still long enough for them to play a baseball game on. That's what they would play. And they play like three games a day every day. And they all traveled together and like um, hung out with one another and spent a lot of time together. So like that, the Negro leagues came out of this um kind of camaraderie of barn storming together, which is pretty awesome. So yeah, this guy, Rube Foster, he owned the UM Chicago American Giants, And confusingly, there was also another Negro team called the Chicago Giants into St. Louis Giants. Yeah, yeah, but like versus Chicago. But if it was Chicago versus Chicago, well which one the Giants? Well, which one the American Giants? Okay, now I understand not just the Giants, but Rube Foster was like this, this booster of boundless enthusiasm. This guy literally put together the first real Negro league, and when he was basically removed from it, the whole the whole thing fell apart. That's how how much of a driver this guy was. Yeah, he's in the Hall of Fame too. Yeah he was a catcher, I think. Uh. Oh, I don't even think he was in as a player, but he was. Yeah, I think just for his achievement. Um, although it may have been both, I don't know. But in nineteen he said, all right, here's what we'll do. Let me get these seven team owners of the Midwestern League that are doing these you know, barnstorming traveling shows. Basically, let's get together in Kansas City, seven all black teams. Uh. In addition to those two Chicago Giants, we have the Cuban Stars, the Dayton Marco's, the Indianapolis abc S, and the very famous Kansas City Monarchs and St. Louis Giants all and this is the really like great thing about the story. All of these teams except for the Monarchs were black owned teams. Right. So, so not only do you have black players careers developing, yeah, you have like black enterprise developing in a in a time when there were very few avenues of opportunity for black people to advance in business. Yeah, and in a sense where they own the business. This is a really good way to do it. Yeah. And not only that, like the Major League Baseball site points out, like this was like it should be embraced in some ways because this at a time was the only one of the only ways that minorities could fully like excel to their fullest potential. And yeah, and that was a point of that article that I thought was pretty cool, is that one of the one of the things they lamented about the segregation of baseball during this time, um, is that we'll never know how Babe Ruth would have stood up against Sachel Page pitching to them because they never got to play each other. So the truly great players are truly great during this time within their own skin color. You know, you can't say they were the greatest in baseball because they were too legitimate, um parallel leagues going on at the time. And yeah, they played each other sometimes, but if you wanted to sit down and put stats against stats, you'd be very hard pressed to do that. Uh sure, Thy Cobb, Babe Ruth Christie Mathison, Like, we know they were good, Like we're not knocking their talent, but who knows what it would have been like in a truly integrated league. Yeah, And actually it's funny to bring up thy Cobb because I was like, oh, yeah, Ty Cobb was a huge racist. I wonder what he thought about the Negro leagues. And I looked it up and I found an article from a guy who argues that Ty Cobb was not the um, the horrible racist that he's made out to be these days, written by Jimmy Cobb. There he found, well, he actually did cite his son, and I think his son's name might be jim Really. Yeah. Um, But the guy found an article from maybe the fifties or something, nineteen fifty two where Ty Cobb is quoted at length coming out in favor of UM integration in baseball, Yeah, saying, like of course these guys should play as long as you know they conduct themselves like, uh, professor and old baseball players, like, why would they not be able to play? I'm totally in favor of it. Interesting, like, did Ty Cobbs say this? I think that bears more research. Yeah, you know, because he was supposedly very racist. Yeah, that's not what this guy says. All right, well I'm gonna look at that. That's not what his son says. I'm not doubting you, of course, I just wanted to know I'm with you. I understand. Uh. So we talked about the integration of the Negro leagues, which was awesome. Pretty soon other leagues for him, not just teams. There was one right here in the South, the Negro Southern League, with teams from right here in Atlanta. Dude, do you know the Atlanta team played directly across the street constantly on Park. Yeah, where there's now a Staples and a home depot in a pet Smart and a Whole Foods. How Like funny is that? Yeah? Um, if you walk into Whole Foods and listen, you can hear the ghost of a backing a ball. Yeah. This I don't think this was the first team in Atlanta that played in the Negro Southern League because they folded that same year. But the Atlantic Black Crackers. We also had the Atlantic Crackers, which was the white team. Um, we had the Atlantic Black Crackers. And it sounds funny that we say Ponce de Leon, uh not Ponton, but that's how we say it here. It's the street that fronts our office building. Puts Daileon himself would have punch you in the stomach if he heard you say his name like that. But that's the street in Atlanta that fronts our office And if you go and look on the internet, you can see these awesome pictures of this cool little baseball stadium. Right they're hundreds of feet from where we sit. Really neat um. But now you have Whole Foods. You just have to listen. Seven dollars for artisan mayonnaise if you're lucky, seven dollars. Oh that's just for the the just for one s. Yeah, just once, is you her? Whole Foods got caught like with uncalibrated scales for their hot bar stuff, like it's not already expensive and yeah that's not I expect a lot more from them. Yeah, you know, never get anything with bones at one of those oh never or liquid what a waste? You throw half of that chicken leg away? Yeah, you paid for it, or just you know, grind that chicken bone up and eat it and get your money, like peel off with your teeth, spit the meat into your into your little basket, and throw the bone back into the hot bar. Yeah. Oh I didn't think about that. That's great idea. And then you can say I'm no chump. Yeah, I just go around screaming and not paying for that bone. Um, all right, So where are we where? The Negro Southern League folded, the Eastern Colored League open in nine, and then finally in nine the American Negue Grow League formed, and that was that was when things like they called eventually the American Negro League in the American I'm sorry, the National Negro League. The mad years of the Negro League, like that was where the crime della crime and um, the everything's going pretty smoothly except two things happen, right, Um, there's even like a Negro League World Series is the best of nine the Kansas City Yeah, the Kansas City Monarchs narrowly beat uh, the hill Dale team they're from Darby, Pennsylvania, which I guess is near Philadelphia. UM in the first one in ninety four, So there's like there's a there's these leagues have established themselves by they have their own world series going right, UM. But just within a few years there are a couple of hits to the league that ultimately led to the the Negro Majors disbanding. UM. One is that Rube Foster suffered gas poisoning in a hotel room. In a hotel room in Indianapolis, he was found unconscious. And there's some theory that UM, like everyone believed in oasts and spirits and mediums in the nineteenth century because they were all being poisoned by the natural gas that was like leaking into their kitchens and homes all the time. Right, Well, this guy had like an acute poisoning and was found unconscious. And after that, when he regained consciousness and his nurse back to health, he lost his mind and he just kept getting worse and worse, and by nine I think it's happened in nineteen twenty four five he was institutionalized in By nineteen thirty he died of a heart attack at age fifty one. UM and again his guidance was so integral uh in this first incarnation of the Negro leagues that you know, when he was institutionalized, obviously they weren't like, what was the league do next? He was in an institution, Um, and the league started to falter and fall apart. And eventually that coupled with the depression, and the onset of the depression really kind of led to the unraveling of the first Negro League. Yeah, and this the Major leag baseball site. Um, you know, these were they profited on certain days of the week. Sundays were big days because they were played double headers. But the fact is, um, Black Americans didn't have a lot of expendable money to throw it going to baseball games, even though they're you know, pretty cheap. That was commiserate with what people made at the time, unless you were one of the Walker brothers whose dad was a physician. Yeah, they probably a little money. Um, they were playing, so I'm sure their parents got in for free. So it's all just a moot point. I wonder if they did get free family tickets back then, I would hope, So, I that's gotta be as old as tickets, right, Probably we gotta do an episode on tickets, guest. Let's uh. So they were making a little money on Sundays, they weren't hugely profitable overall, even though they were known as somewhat successful. Like, no, a lot of these guys were still barn storming on their off days. Yeah. And these are the players, you know, trying to make ends meet, like the owners themselves were struggling here and there. Um. White people came to see games sometimes, especially when they were exhibition games against white teams, because they love to go out there and see the see something they had never seen before, which many times was the black team mopping the floor with the white team. Um, although it seemed pretty evenly matched, like from what I gathered, it wasn't like lopside in one way or the other. Like they were good competitive games. Yeah. There are plenty of um, white players who are better than the black players, and there are plenty of black players who are better than white players. Yeah. Yeah, I would say evenly match is a good way to put so if you had an integrade league, you would get the best of both, which is eventually what we got. Plus also in some of these cities, Chuck, these there they were not just baseball was segregated, but just within the city you had a white team and you had a black team. And that's that's evidence to the names of some of the black teams, like the Black Crackers, the Black Yankees. Um, there were the Yankees and then there were the Crackers. Right, So if you were a white player or a white person, you're probably a fan of the white team and you weren't going and watching the black teams play, right. Um, so they list out four things here on the site. They said the two leagues, uh, the American and National Negro Leagues were northern and basically city dwelling teams. A couple that with, um, there weren't a lot of black people living in northern cities at the time. Uh. The South was, you know, was way more Uh well, I want to say integrated, but it wasn't integrated. Uh, way more black people living in the South at the time. Yeah, which is I wonder why the Southern Negro League didn't take off like a rocket then. Yeah. I mean probably for the other reasons, like you couldn't afford to go to the games and all that stuffy Uh black people that were in the North, Uh, didn't have a whole lot of money, and so basically all that adds up to not a lot of audience buying tickets. And the only way to keep a league afloat is to sell tickets and to sell concessions, same as it is today. So all those things coupled with Rube Foster the depression. There the greatest champion and probably sharpest mind. Uh, sadly succumbing to mental illness and then the depression. And that was the end of the beginning of the Negro leagues, right, yeah, that was the end of the first one. Yes, and there were more to come, and we'll talk about it right after this. I ski all right, So uh, it didn't take long. Uh, the old saying you can't keep a good man down. People wanted to play baseball, they were good at it. Um. They thought there was more money to be made in leagues. And so what happens is these numbers guys get involved, and a numbers man is the numbers game was basically like an illegal, unsanctioned street lottery. Right, So numbers guys have a lot of money, and some of them said, you know what, let's put money into starting baseball teams. In leagues, and one guy in particular in Pittsburgh, Gus Greenley, great name. He was a bar owner in Pittsburgh. He bought the Pittsburgh Crawford's in nineteen thirty one. He said, well, I've got a team, but I don't have a league. So two years later he formed the second Negro National League, and other numbers guys bought in, and all of a sudden they had another league going. UM and this basically kicked off what's known as the Golden Age of the Negro leagues. UM starting about nineteen thirty one thirty three, when when these other teams came about, and um, Greenley's team himself, was it his? No, I'm sorry, it would have been right across the river, the Homestead Grays. Yeah, they eventually migrated back to Pittsburgh over to Pittsburgh, so they were the same team that went from one town to another. They weren't rivals. Now, I think there was still the other Pittsburgh team, but from what I understand, the Homestead Grades eventually became part of Pittsburgh, or maybe there was another team on that shirt, but I do know they eventually get went to Pittsburgh because you know, Homestead. We've been there. We did a show there. Ye yeah, okay um, and I was like, are we going to the right place? And the car was taking me. So Homestead used to have not just a team, they used to have the best Negro League team possibly ever. Oh yeah, wait easy. For nine consecutive years they won the Pennant all right, yeah, nine years in a row. Josh Gibson, cool, Papa Bell and Buck Leonard some of their stars, yeah, just some of them. In they had no less than five future Hall of famers on on the team. Five. That's amazing. Point to a team that has five future Hall of Famers on it now or ever did well? So some of the Yankees teams did over the years. But like, I don't think anything right now now, Like even the best team right now doesn't have five future Hall of Famers. It's certainly not the Braves. We don't have one. I don't know. I could see Freddie Freeman hit in the Hall of Fame one day. M hm, oh really, I haven't been watching the last couple of seasons. I mean, he's our best player. But because the best player on the worst team in baseball not very good at the bat, alright, So we did mention that, um, there were exhibition games going on, and things really picked up with the exhibition games now because they were a little well funded. And this is when UM, white players would come and see the teams playing and mean it was basically more popular than ever. Uh in both communities. Yes, and UM we said that they had the UM the Negro League World Series going on, right, UM, there was actually another game that came out of this. I think it was UM, it might have been Gus Greenley, I think it was who came up with this is the East versus West All Stars game, and that became bigger than the World Series and whatever was in the Negro Leagues. It was huge. Yeah, So UM that became kind of like the de facto big game of the year rather than the World Series for UM, and they played it every year I think in Comiskey Field. Yeah, in Chicago, because you know East and East West in Chicago. That's what it says on the T shirts. At least, so players are starting to make some like the top players are starting to make some pretty good money at the time. You can't go any further without talking about uh Satchel Page Leroy satchel page. Dude. He was, um a picture very interesting dude, maybe the greatest picture of all time in the sport of baseball. Maybe he was eccentric, He was an entertainer. He was like the US same Bolt of his day. People loved him, Okay, except he didn't like to run. That would make a little different. Even said he didn't like to run. What was his quote? He said that, um, training for me is rising gently from the bench, back onto the bench. So he had have you ever seen video or I guess you know film of him pitching, Yeah, with those old timey baggy baseball pants, and yeah that was the style. But his um, he had a weird wind up. He had this sort of double windmill that he would do with his pitching arm. And then um, when he was younger, he had a great fastball, and he had he was noted for his control like Greg Maddox, like in his pinpoint control like supposed he could just put a baseball within a half inch of where he wanted it to be, which is a big big deal for a picture. Um, As he lost his fastball over the years, he learned basically every pitch under the sun. Like he pitched until he was fifty nine years old. He first he first signed in the Major's White majors at forty two. Forty two, forty two year old rookie. He's the he's the oldest rookie ever in the Major League Baseball and I think the oldest picture ever. Well yeah, um, he was even older than Gaylord Perry. How old was he? He was in his forties, like Nolan Ryan, Gaylord Perry. Nolan Ryan made it to fifty, not fifty, but he came close. Like pictures notably have been a little older, which is crazy because like their arms and yeah, but they're not you know, they're not like running around and batting like other players. Yeah, but you're right, like Freddie Freeman, like the stress on the stress on the arm is amazing. So one thing that that was problematic or is problematic when you're going back in looking at the negro leagues is that, um, a lot of teams were allowed to, depending on the league, were allowed to set their own schedules. Um, stats weren't kept quite as um well as they were in the white leagues. Yeah, we don't know Satil pagees real lifetime stats. No, but in full there are some estimates and they are high. So the one that I saw is that Sachiel page Head. I think it was in this um this article on MLB dot com, which eventually will say the author's name. Right. Um, they said that he had three hundred career shutouts. Three career shutouts, and this guy says in italics, not wins, shutouts. Right, Yeah, if you don't know baseball, shutout means you have pitched a game where no one scored a run. And back then they were probably complete game shutouts, meaning he never came out and was relieved by another picture. Right, he would have pitched like all nine innings back in the in the day. They should do that way more than they do now. Okay, so he had three hundred career shutouts. Fift hundred wins is the estimate that that's on MLB dot com. Yeah, to put that into perspective for non baseball fans again, if you have three hundred wins wins, not shutouts, win, then you're a Hall of Famer. And in fact, they don't think there will ever be another three hundred game winner again because of they are more pictures in the rotation now they usually have five guys instead of four. They don't pitches deep into games. They rest them a lot more. So it's just we may not ever see that happen again, just because of the way it's built. It To also put in perspective, cy Young is um regarded as one of the best pictures ever in in Major League Baseball, named the Top Award after him exactly. He had seventies six shutouts, which is amazing. He had the most wins ever still in Major League Baseball at five eleven, so Satchel page Head conceivably three times more. Yeah, then the the highest win count ever in Major league and that's counting his entire career assume, which again was very very long. It was a very long career. But that just makes it all the more amazing, especially as he gets older. Yeah, Like, let's let's say that people don't say, don't count the negro leagues as being in the top league at the time. I cut it in half, and he's still way ahead of everybody else if you subtract fifty of everything he did and the fact that he sat in a rocking chair and the dugout and had like a huge personality. Yeah, so he learned all sorts of pitches. By the end of his career, he was pitching knuckleballs and he was famous for the hesitation pitch, which he invented, which was when he got to the White major leagues, they were like, that's illegal. He can't do that. It's called the bulk and uh. He was like, all right, well know, He's like, no, it's called the hesitation pitch. It was very sneaky. Um. You know, it's like you you act like you're pitching, then you stop. And because his theory, he was like, you know, I got guys up there that are starting to swing because I'm so fast, Like when they see me winding up, they're starting to swing. So if I just put a little slight pause there, then they're swinging and then the ball comes. So it's very very tricky little pitch. Um. And he was making between thirty and forty grand a year and the Negro and this is also with appearances and stuff like that, but in the Negro leagues, which is about half a million dollars today. Yeah, amazing amount of money at the time, you know, and those appearances, um uh uh. If you were a team owner that had Satual Page on your team, uh, you might let him go make some scratch and probably take a cut yourself by lending him to another team whose attendance was struggling. And all you had to do was advertised for a week that Satual Page is gonna be pitching one day, and you would sell out, so he would help other Negro League teams that were that that we're struggling. Yeah, to be a draw. And here's one little cool thing about our in Atlanta Braves and hight Satchel. Page was lacking one more season to get his major league baseball pension and was out of the league and retired, and the Atlanta Braves signed him as a player coach like Terry Pendleton. Yeah, he was never a player coach, was he? No, But here's a player and then a coach. Oh yeah, Pete Rose was a player coach. Was he really? Like? He managed the Reds and played for them. I didn't know and bet on them. Yeah, but they signed him to a one year deal so he could get his major league baseball penchion. That is awesome, which is really cool? Year? Was that? That's really cool? Yeah, go brave. So if you see a picture when I saw a picture of him in the Braves uniform. I was like, wait a minute, he never played for the Braves, and he really didn't. It was it was sort of, you know, just a little sneaky way to get him in there, which is great. Um, all right, so Satchel Page is killing it, other players are killing it. It would not be long before somebody in the White League's somebody said the talent is too good. Somebody has to be the first to make this move and break the color barrier. Yeah, right, you know that was the thing Like this. The Negro leagues were ultimately, as we'll find out, victims of their own success. The players that they supported and brought into the game, we're of obvious major league caliber in any major league. They were the best in the world. They were just playing on segregated teams. And so finally a group of people, but especially it usually comes in the form of one guy named branch Rickey. Yeah. Did Tom Hanks play him? No? Harrison Ford? No? Maybe? Well I didn't see them recent jacket was Harrison Ford? Maybe I've seen him portrayed in other movies. I can't tell if it was him or not, because the actor didn't have a diamond studded earring in but Harrison Ford could have taken it out for the role. Uh. This guy named branch Rickey, he was he an executive or a manager for the Dodgers. He was he was with he was an executive. And he said, and this was when they were in Brooklyn, right, He said, this is ridiculous there that we need to break this color barrier. There's plenty of great players out there that I want to sign. I'm going to break this unspoken rule. And he looked around to find a player who was not only good, but who he felt could withstand this horrendous reception that whoever the first black player would be would definitely receive. And who did receive and he found it in the in the person of Jackie Robinson. Yeah, that's a that's a huge point, um, because like I said, jet Roy Empanella was probably better player at the time than Jackie Robinson. But if you see the Jackie Robinson story, Uh, I didn't see the recent one, like I said, but I just know a lot about his story. He was the right guy. He had the temperament, he had the leadership. Um, Roy Campanella, take your head off, Well, yeah he did. He was a tough guy, but Jackie Robinson was was the man in every way. And we should also shout out to the road being paved by people like Joe Lewis and Jesse Owens before Jackie Robinson, as far as just white America accepting mainstream black athletes into their lives. Yeah. And I don't know if it was on this or on there's a site called negro League Baseball dot com UM that has a really good article called Negro League Baseball one oh one or something like that. This is the basics. There's a definite story to the whole thing, right, UM. But they point out that UM, probably more than anything that helped break the color barrier was UM blacks serving in World War Two, serving alongside UM white soldiers and and stories coming back from the fronts of like, hey, these guys are killing Germans just as fast as any any white guy. UM. And at the time America was like, well, we love that about people. So when they returned, UM, the black soldiers came home to a different America that they helped change by fighting in World War two. And I mean that the timing of this apparently is not coincidental that Jackie Robinson was signing the six a year after World War Two. One. Uh So branch Ricky was. Um, he was a very puritanical guy. He would often lecture players on sex and drinking and stuff, and he was he wasn't just some benevolent, benevolent champion of the black man. Yeah, that's that's a good point, man, because a lot of times stories like this end up being about the guy who took the change and paved the way for the black players. But he did, he did. But emphasis it's just too easy sometimes for the emphasis to go onto that where it's like, well, the black player like he came. He was one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Exactly. Let's let's put it this way. If branch Rickey hadn't wanted to sell tickets by fielding a good team, he would have never signed Jackie Robinson. He was a businessman. The Dodgers sucked at the time, and um, but he was an idealist. I mean he was very much like, no, like this is wrong and they should be allowed to play, so okay. So he was a complex human being like all other human beings. He can't just be shoehorned into an easy caricature. That's great. So branch Ricky complicated human being. He selected Jackie Robinson and it was a great selection. Yeah, Jackie Robinson played one year in the miners, which was ridiculous. Um, they should have just like he spent his entire life playing in the miners. Uh, they should have just promoted him right away. But I think they just wanted to ease that transition. He won the batting title in the minors his only year there, and then uh, one Rookie of the Year in his very first year with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and uh that was April fifteenth, ninety seven was when uh he made his debut, which was very very historic day, an amazing day that Major League Baseball is really like honored Jackie Robinson to the fullest. Now, yeah, they should great. Jackie Robinson definitely threw up in the floodgates. Within four months of Jackie Robinson being signed or no, I guess actually being called up to the majors, two other guys um were signed, both in July, and I think that year there were a number of other um black players suddenly playing for white Major League Baseball, which is suddenly not now just Major League Baseball not white major League baseball. That's uh. Larry Dobie Clea and Indians Willard Brown, the St. Louis Brown's Henry Hank Thompson, the St. Louis Brown's Dan Bankhead Leroy Satchel Page made it finally, uh, and of course Roy Campanella, among others. These were the first African Americans in Major League Baseball and UM by nineteen fifty two, just a few years later, there were a hundred and fifty black players, and by all but four major league teams had black players. There were a few holdouts. Yeah. The Boston Red Sox notably were the last. They waited until nineteen fifty nine, thirteen years after Jackie Robinson's debut season. Yeah, in the in the minors. So with the signing of Jackie Robinson and all the players to follow, like you hinted at earlier, UM, and like this article UH plainly says it was, it was a very bitter sweet end um. And one way it was great, the color barrier was smashed, the league was being integrated, and they were getting their due. Um, although it was a struggle. But in another way, it was also sad that this league that had so much gumption and such a great like we'll do it ourselves then attitude, uh, and empower these men to play, and these people to own these teams and start their own leagues. So it was definitely like a weird time in history. It is, like I think nowadays there's much more of a reverence and a bit of mourning for the disappearance of that league. Um. But you know, in another way, like I said, it was smashing the color barrier was way more sure, way more better. We just went into hulk speak. So yeah, it would have been a much more satisfying end of the whole thing if the Negro leagues had poached the best players in the um white Major League Baseball. Oh. Actually, you know what the best possible thing could have been was if the white major leagues absorbed those teams and owners and ownership. It's part of one big league. But they were like, no, we're just gonna take your players give them to us. So, um, that is Negro League Baseball, the history of it. YEP officially disbanded in and this article says into the nineteen fifties, there were still a few teams playing here and there, and in the early nineteen sixties even that was like one final team or I guess one final pair of teams. I guess they had to play somebody still playing, right, or they could scrimmage themselves. Yeah, it says the Negro American League was the last to throw in the town early sixties. Yeah. So yeah, more than one team. And this article makes a point today, or at least in two thousand twelve, UM, major League baseball was non white, which I was like, what I would have guessed it was the opposite of that that I would not have gues of Major League baseball players are white. Yeah, and you know, there's a big push I think, like the one of the least represented demographics now in pro baseball or African Americans. Yeah, partially because of the rise of Latino players, um, and then partially because they there's not a big a push to play baseball these days as kids in America, and so they're there. There's a lot of concerted efforts to try and get baseball going again in black communities, UM, which is awesome. You know. Yeah, I know I was pushed. My dad was like, get out there and get hit in the head with the ball. Let's see. I wouldn't allowed, I would I had to play church softball, so lame. Uh So, then the color bears broken, and now the last vestige of any sort of color issue is the Native American slurs that are rampant in in all sports as far as teams go.
