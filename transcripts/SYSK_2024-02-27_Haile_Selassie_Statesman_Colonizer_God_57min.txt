00:02:21
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh and there's Chuck and it's just the two of us, and we are here to just wrap it up. Rap rap rap, I have a little chat, a little talk, and just rap, just the two of us. We do that every time Jerry's not here. That song every time we reference it some way, shape or form. It's not that great of a song.

00:02:47
iHeart Intro: Oh God, please tell me you're joking.

00:02:51
Josh: No, I'm actually not. I think it's one of those ones I've just heard too many times. Sorry, it's all right. I can't listen to Journey any longer either, If that makes you feel any better.

00:03:03
iHeart Intro: Well, this is Bill Withers, all right.

00:03:06
Josh: But I'm sick of that song.

00:03:09
iHeart Intro: Okay.

00:03:10
Josh: I think Austin Powers was the one that put it over the top.

00:03:16
iHeart Intro: Was it in that movie? Yeah?

00:03:17
Josh: He turned it into like a rap what yeah? With him and Mini Me?

00:03:22
iHeart Intro: Oh god?

00:03:22
Josh: No, wonder who thought Mini Me was going to show up in the Hyle Selassie I did not until just now.

00:03:30
iHeart Intro: Yeah, same here. This is a complicated episode about a complicated story.

00:03:36
Josh: Yeah, And the reason why we should just come out of the gate and explain why this is so complicated. Number one, we're talking about a human being who ruled a nation, one of the most powerful nations on the continent of Africa, for virtually his entire lifetime. Right, There's a lot that can happen during that time. You can make a lot of enemies, you can become revered, and so as a consequence, the guy did a lot of stuff, a lot of good stuff, a lot of shady stuff, a lot of downright evil stuff. And over the course of the time that he was ruling and then beyond, some people came to venerate him as a god, like a god on earth. Other people came to loathe them as a murderous colonizer. Other people saw him as a modernizer of a nation. There's so many different opinions about this guy that it's really gonna be tough to cram it all in into this one episode. But we're gonna, we're gonna try. We're gonna make it if we try.

00:04:29
iHeart Intro: Yeah, And I think aside from the god thing, which you know, we'll get to. I think he kind of was a lot of those things. He did modernize Ethiopia and he was a progressive voice for Africans, but he also did a lot of bad things, and it seemed like, I don't know, for my it seemed like the last twenty years of his life he did a lot more bad than the first like forty years of his rule.

00:04:56
Josh: That's what I got to. He started to phone it in, I think, and be awful. Well that's a consequence of phoning it.

00:05:04
iHeart Intro: In, you know. Yeah, but when you if you do a little research on Highly Selassie, you'll see a lot of articles like praising him, like really strongly, and then a lot of articles that are like, why are we rewriting this the history of this person to not include any of the bad stuff.

00:05:20
Josh: Well, what's amazing is you can actually there's an answer to that question. The reason why is because of reggae. You can thank reggae for reforming the image of Highly Selassie across the world. It's amazing, it's astounding, it's it's been really effective. Yeah, So Chuck, we're going to talk about Highly Selassie, who is the Ruler of Ethiopia, the Emperor of Ethiopia. In fact, he had one of the most amazing titles of any ruler anywhere. When he became emperor, his official title was His Imperial Majesty, the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, highly Selassie, the First elect of God, Emperor of Ethiopia. That was his full time, which is just straight up impressive.

00:06:03
iHeart Intro: Yeah, there were a lot of different titles that he had over the years, and a lot of different names for the different titles. He gets kind of can get in the weeds with that stuff. I just did not well. But he also had another title at the same time, which I can't even find right now, but we'll get to.

00:06:19
Josh: So let's talk a little bit about Ethiopia, the country that he ruled. You know, those of us off the continent considered Ethiopia is like a cohesive whole nation, But like most nations across the world, on any continent, it's actually an assemblage of different smaller units that were eventually brought together and unified into a nation like we recognize today.

00:06:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and unified as sort of a should be in quotes.

00:06:46
Josh: Sure, Yeah, that's a good point.

00:06:49
iHeart Intro: Yeah, so it is in the Horn of Africa, and like you said, it was home to lots of civilizations over the course of you know, ancient history and then you know, over through time, and it was it was a pretty big power. It is unique for that area. And then it was one of the first Christian nations and remained a Christian nation despite being completely cut off from the rest of the Christian world on all sides basically.

00:07:19
Josh: Yeah, and it was one of the oldest around. It's state religion is Christianity, I think Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, that branch of the Christian Church. And since like I think the fourth century see at least, so for a very long time, it's been a Christian nation and that meant that it had like pretty good relations with other Christian nations around the world. But also it traded with the tribes in Arabia, it traded with others in the Middle East. Like it was a really important power for a really long time.

00:07:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And we should probably talk about the Slomonic dynasty. Yeah, while is in King Solomon, the Coronation of Yakuno, and you know, we're doing our best with a lot of these names I tried to look most of these up.

00:08:08
Josh: By the way, Well how's this one go?

00:08:12
iHeart Intro: Well, this one goes Yakuno Amlac in twelve seventy. And this is important because, like I said, is in King Solomon. This dynasty basically says, we are the direct descendants of King Solomon and Queen of Sheba from the Bible, and the line of Judah is our symbol. And you know, this is the sort of solemn line that as we'll see, would you know eventually d Halli Selassie.

00:08:43
Josh: Yeah. And it's found among the Amhara people, which are one of the groups of people living in the Ethiopian region at the time. And some people say that this dynasty, this lineage of rulers is the oldest in the world. If you credit that as factual or even roughly factual, that King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba produced Menelik the First as a son who became the first ruler of this Solomonic dynasty, then that's we're talking like three thousand years essentially of rule by this one group in this one area. Historians say that's a great story. Also, Menelik the First is said to have brought the arc of the Covenant to Ethiopia where it's supposedly being hidden or kept, but really we can date it as far back as twelve seventy, which is nothing to sneeze at, when Yakuno Ambloc was definitely coronated. Since twelve seventy there's been nothing but solomonic rulers ever since then. That's a pretty pretty good track record.

00:09:42
iHeart Intro: Frankly, yeah, for sure. But again that's not to say that there was like complete unity under that rule throughout the years. In the eighteenth then early into the nineteenth century, Ethiopia was very fractured. There were a lot of feudal kingdoms, a lot of different like you mentioned, really religions and ethnicities are sort of you know, co mingling with one another. And eventually, as far as our story goes, unification around the eighteen fifties is when things really sort of get well more unified.

00:10:16
Josh: Right, And I was wondering what the answer is, like if there is a definitive answer. Is unification a good thing because it keeps formerly warring neighboring groups from warring, or is it a bad thing because these groups were warring for a reason and now they're kind of smushed together, whether they like it or not. Yeah, you know, I wonder if it's a case by case basis, or if there's a right way to do it or a wrong way to do it, or that you shouldn't do it at all. I don't know.

00:10:40
iHeart Intro: It's a good question.

00:10:42
Josh: So by the nineteenth century, Emperor Menelik the Second, who took the throne six or so hundred years after his namesake did, who found the Solomonic dynasty, became the ruler of a unified Ethiopia. And that's really where the story kind of begins as far as where our protagonist, Liej Tafari Makonan is concerned.

00:11:09
iHeart Intro: That's right, because he was born July twenty third, eighteen ninety two, just what three years after Menelik the Second was crowned, right yep, So you know we're talking about highly Selassie. But as you said, born Lidge Tafari. Lidge means child of Tafari is one who is respected or feared. So Lidge Tafari Maconin is child of Maconin who is respected and feared.

00:11:38
Josh: Yeah, and his dad was raz which means Prince Macanin, So his dad was a prince already it's pretty good birthright, you know, especially in a feudal society that I was born into. But even more than that, his great grandfather, Sahale Selasse had been emperor of the Kingdom of Shuwa before Ethiopia was unified. So this guy had like literal royal blood and was part of that Solomonic dynasty just by birth.

00:12:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and you said his dad was prince. The word there would be ross, And that's important to just put a pin in that because if you put Ross and Tafari together, you will eventually get Rastafari.

00:12:22
Josh: Which sounds vaguely familiar. I can't put a finger on you.

00:12:25
iHeart Intro: Already mentioned reggae music, so that's where this is all eading. But Ross means prince. His father was a governor of the Harar province advisor to the emperor, which at this point, I believe you already said was Menelik the second ye and the first During the Menelik the second years, and when Tafari was young, this is when Italy had its sort of first first push into trying to basically you know, this is a period of rapid colonization from the Europeans all over Africa, think it was called the Scramble for Africa, and this was Italy's first push because they had land on both sides of Ethiopia and Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, and Ethiopia was kind of right there in the middle. But they were defeated that first time when fifteen thousand Italians were beaten back by about seventy five thousand Ethiopians in the Battle of Adwa.

00:13:24
Josh: Yeah, and so Menelik the second became just revered for that, like this African country beat back in a colonial power from Europe, and it was a huge national black eye on Italy that they carried a soreness for for decades afterward, as we'll see. But it was an enormous feather in the cap of Ethiopia because at the time this Scramble for Africa, one group after another was falling prey to these colonial powers who were just moving in, moving their people, in taking over, forcing a lot of these people in slavery, extracting their resources. In Ethiopia said no, nice, try Italy, We're going to remain self sufficient and self determined.

00:14:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's a good point. His mother, Yeshimabet, died when he was about two years old, and he went on to get a really sort of unusual and vast education under the teachings of French missionaries, other teachers and scholars. He learned which was unusual at the time for where he was a lot of European history and languages, and that education would set him up for his later life on the international stage.

00:14:37
Josh: Yeah for sure. I mean, his familiarity with Europe would be extraordinarily helpful because Europe, even though some of the former Age of Exploration powers like lost their clout, Europe still remained super important in Africa because they were colonizers. So to have a rapport with European powers was very helpful keeping them at bay and also making Ethiopia a really treasured asset or ally to those European powers too.

00:15:10
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure.

00:15:10
Josh: It was just a good position for him to be in.

00:15:13
iHeart Intro: Oh absolutely, and he ingratiated himself. He was very much loved on the international stage for most of his life, which you know, was kind of at odds with how he was viewed at home for the last couple of decades.

00:15:24
Josh: Yeah. So, because he was born into that royal lineage, he kind of made moves throughout the court in at age thirteen, he was made a de Jasmach, yeah, which is essentially like a count. And from that point on he just kept rising and rising further and further up in importance in the aristocracy. Right, because we should say, at the time, and for a very long time, Ethiopia was a feudal agrarian society and economy where peasants worked the land and had to give a lot of the fruits of their labor over to land owners who didn't do anything except extract labor and goods from the peasantry. And then it went up and up and up, and then you had an aristocracy that was sitting at the top that was also tiered, and at the very top of this where the rulers of Ethiopia, of which ros Tafari was rising in rank and influence.

00:16:24
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And slavery played a big part in that and a big part in this story, as you'll see. So just sort of setting that up. Over the next few years, he was, like you said, kind of rising through these different positions. He got married in nineteen eleven to a noble woman named men in Asphalt and had six kids, and they stayed married until she died in nineteen sixty two, and then in nineteen thirteen, Menelect the second died, and there was a very sort of interesting power struggle that went on because his literal successor was his grandson Iyazu the fifth, and he was not good enough for the job. Evidently he was not a good manager of people, didn't show a lot of promise as a ruler, and even more importantly, he was I mean, the rumor was that he actually converted to Islam. He was not friendly to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and because of these rumors and he was deposed as emperor. He was arrested and spent the rest of his life in detention wherein his I believe, in nineteen sixteen, his aunt Zuditu was crowned empress.

00:17:39
Josh: Yeah, and then so I don't I didn't get this. I didn't understand why I couldn't find what maybe you know. Simultaneously or shortly after Zuditu was crowned, Empress, Tafari became Ras Tafari and the de facto ruler of Ethiopia as the Supreme region an heir apparent? Was it because he was young still? I guess he was twenty five at the time. Was it because he was a man and she was a woman and a woman that always have okay, gotcha? Okay, So they were basically power sharing, even though because he was a man, I'm guessing he was just deferred to over her in a society that requires an empress to have like a male regent with her right.

00:18:25
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I mean, that's basically I saw that in two or three different places that if he I'm sorry, if Zuditwo was was a man, he may have still had that position, but he would not have nearly the power that he had as a man because she was a woman.

00:18:40
Josh: Gotcha. So as this de facto ruler of Ethiopi, he started making moves on the world stage, and there was a difference between his and Zudituo's politics from the outset. She was more conservative than he was. He was much more being younger, I think was a big part of it, much more progressive minded, much more interested in modernizing, much more interested in opening the country to internationalism. And so in nineteen twenty three, Ethiopia became a member of the League of Nations, just the third African country to do so, and that was after South Africa and Liberia and that was like one hundred percent Tafari's doing from what I understand.

00:19:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, totally. Part of that required the pledge to you know, abolish slavery. As we'll see, that was in nineteen twenty three, and the abolition of slavery in Ethiopia did not happen in full for many, many decades, So it was you know, that's another you know, sort of a thread that goes to this story of just how long it took to get slavery abolished there because it was such a part of their tiered system in Ethiopia.

00:19:51
Josh: And it's worth saying too, I think, Chuck, that African continental style slavery was much different from the kind of slavery that was developed through the Transatlantic trade that was established here in the United States in the Americas.

00:20:09
iHeart Intro: But yeah, I think literal human ownership was not the case.

00:20:13
Josh: Yeah, I mean, there was still like a curtailment of liberty, but at the same time, you lived in the same house and ate the same food that you're you know, putative owner ate. It was just you were just treated much differently, and you don't want to sanitize it because you're still you still didn't have freedom like an individual human being should have. But just compared to just the horrors of the transatlantic chattel slavery practices like the African slave trade was, it was just not like it at all in a lot of ways.

00:20:46
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. So in nineteen twenty eight he was named Nebus, which is a title equivalent to king, but it's not the same as, you know, the king, as we would think, because it's still below emperor. And he started traveling the world basically and every single way, basically becoming the face of Ethiopia despite the fact that he was not emperor, you know, going to Jerusalem, going to Rome, going to Paris, meeting with King George, to the Fifth in London, and it was sort of a world tour where he placed himself expressly, sort of in the limelight. As you said that, you know, he had different politics than the Empress herself, and that combined with him sort of putting himself on the world stage in front of her essentially did not sit well to the point where her husband led a rebellion goog Saulle where he wanted to install himself as emperor, but he was defeated by Tafari was killed and then within a couple of days later, Zuditu died of unclear circumstances, and I think we all know what that means.

00:21:55
Josh: Well, yeah, there's a rumor that she died of shock at the news of her husband's death. But more likely there's just kind of this idea that Holly Selassie was not above poisoning opponents and rivals, and that's entirely possible that's how she went away.

00:22:14
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. And we should also point out prior to this, prior to nineteen thirty through the nineteen like late nineteen twenties, he was really doing a lot of that progressive work, building roads. He established a national bank, He redid the judicial system that kind of said, you know, we need a more you know, modern Western based judicial system and not this, you know, you steal love for bread and we cut off your hand Biblical style.

00:22:41
Josh: And yeah, he continued that on when he became ruler after Zudido was gone November Tewod nineteen thirty, which is the holiest day of days for the Rasta religion. As we'll see, Tafari became highly Selassie again. His imperial majesty, the conquering line of the tribe of Judah. Highly Celassie the first elect of God Emperor of Ethiopia, and one of the first things he did was to write the first written constitution that Ethiopia ever had, and it was extremely progressive, especially considering again this is a feudal agrarian society we're talking about.

00:23:22
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, for them, it was very very much a step forward. He did create their first parliament, but it was pretty clear with this, and even when they made further changes I think in the nineteen fifties to the constitution that it was still you know, the emperor had the last say over everything.

00:23:42
Josh: Right, So I think that kind of goes to show the kind of governing he did, Like he was well aware of if you, you know, agree to something but figure out a way to not do it or to keep it from taking any power away from you, it can really placate people a lot. He was kind of asterful with that, and that's a good example of that.

00:24:03
iHeart Intro: All Right, Is that a good long intro?

00:24:06
Josh: Yeah?

00:24:07
iHeart Intro: Forgot, we haven't taken a break yet, So we'll take a break, we'll come back and we'll pick up with Italy's second push into Ethiopia in the nineteen thirties. Right after this.

00:24:43
Josh: Okay, so about five years after Holly Selassie or i should say Tafari McConnon became Holly Selassie, Italy came a call in again. Remember you said that Italy had Eric to kind of the north and the east and Somaliland to the south in the east. Is that correct? Still?

00:25:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and they wanted to build a railroad through Ethiopia to connect those.

00:25:10
Josh: Okay, So again, by this time, Mussolini has come to power in Italy and he has revived national pride. That's a big thing that you'll see in history. Fascism tends to follow a major humiliation of a country on a world stage, like Germany was humiliated in the Treaty after World War One and just really punished, and fascism developed out of that. Italy lost a lot of standing as a colonial European power after it was beaten back by Ethiopia in the nineteenth century. Fascism followed after that. You really want to be careful about stuff like that, not addressing the fascism that can follow, and this is another example of that. So Mussolini came along and he's like, hey, you remember the time that Ethiopia defeated US, Well, we're going to make that up. We're going to go invade Ethiopia again, and this time we're going to do it with industrial warfare.

00:26:08
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it was a much different deal. This time. They had far better equipment and weaponry and ammunition. I believe they were still maybe technically outnumbered, but the way Ethiopians were fighting was sort of outdated to the war machine of Italy at this point. So it was it was a real David versus Goliath kind of situation. So this is when Selassie has a real chance to kind of take center stage internationally, even more so by you know, started you know, sort of rattling the chains of the League of Nations, which Italy was a member of as well. Yeah, saying like, hey, what's going on here? Is it right? We need some help. It was called the Obscenia crisis, Obscenia being the exonym for Ethiopia that US all used basically more than Ethiopia and my research. And it was a dark time in this war. They were getting beaten down really badly. He was exiled because the Italians were literally encroaching to the capital. So he went to French Somaliland in May of nineteen thirty six, which effectively ended the war, like least as far as Italy's concerned. They were like, the war is over and we won.

00:27:31
Josh: Yeah, and now we're occupying Ethiopia. Like you said, we won. The way that they won was through mustard gas. It was essentially a huge campaign of muster gas. There were massacres, they set up concentration camps. It was a horrible occupation, just exactly the kind you would expect from like a first half of the twentieth century colonizing power. And yet they historians still say that Ethiopian never was colonized. It was occupied by Italy, but they didn't get a chance to colonize, which is often follows occupation. They just remained in the occupation stage for about five years. And over the course of that five years, Selassie was in exile. I think he was in bath, England, where he ran a government in absentia and still kind of tried to keep his rule going, but from outside the country which was occupied by the Italians, which is tougher than it even sounds.

00:28:32
iHeart Intro: Yeah, totally, So he is sort of rattling the saber to the League of Nations, so much so that Time magazine named him Man of the Year in nineteen thirty five. But the problem was is that Europe was still courting Italy at this point. They weren't They hadn't fully jumped over to Germany side, and so they were sort of on a sort of a high wire there trying to court Italy. And even though they're a member of the League of Nations and they were attacking another member of the League of Nations, they didn't want to do anything to tick off Italy too much. So the new British Foreign Secretary guy named Samuel Horr got into private talks with the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval, and they came up with the Horror Laval Pact, which essentially said, Ethiopia, if you give up basically half of your land to Italy, we can make the fighting stop. They never released it, but it was leaked to the press and there was outrage, of course, and it essentially was sort of the first blow to what would be the death of the League of Nations.

00:29:40
Josh: Yeah, I think another thing that Holly Selassie's speech did to contribute to the League of Nations was to basically point out like, hey, you guys aren't doing anything that you agreed to do, Like all of you condemned Italy's invasion as a straight up invasion. And here I am to ask you to help me buy arms. Don't even give me, just give me money so I can go buy arms, and you still won't do it. What's the use of this thing? So that was another blow to it. And then subsequently Highly Selassie became even more I guess, kind of respected on the world stage. That speech was a huge watershed moment in his rule, in his lifetime, even he became essentially celebrity, like you said, Time magazine named a Man of the Year. Apparently there was an expression in America around that time that developed that was, well, if that's so, then I'm highly Selassie. And then there was a song too. Olivia helps us with this. She turned up a mention of him in a shanty and old shantytown. I'd be just as sassy as highly Selassie if I were a king.

00:30:49
iHeart Intro: So things are not going well. He is, like you said. He went from Prince Somaliland in exile to England and then finally in nineteen forty one, World War two as well underway. And this is well after Italy had joined up with the Germans and England, you know, finally helps out mainly because Italy and Germany had threatened British territory in Africa. England finally steps up in nineteen forty one and says, all right, well you're going to help you out here because we're sort of threatened as well. We have some area here in the Sudan, and so we're going to help you assemble an army here and take back your capital.

00:31:32
Josh: Yes, so that was a huge deal. It was not just the British Army, but the British Army working in conjunction with these fighters that were assembled in Somaliland. And there was a guy who doesn't get his due, Lorenzo teaz Oz, who on behalf of Selassie, organized this basically guerrilla army that fought against the Italians and ended up winning, pushing the Italians out of Ethiopium back into Eritrea.

00:32:05
iHeart Intro: That's right, and so he came back May fifth, nineteen forty one, returned to the capitol, gave a big speech saying, you know, we need to get the Italians out of here. But we need to do it in a way that's not like they were doing things, because you know, we're above that kind of thing. And so he's finally back on his throne. He begins in the early nineteen forties to abolish slavery. I think in nineteen forty two is when they say he officially abolished it, but it took a long time for it to completely, you know, get removed from the system. But you know, like I said, in nineteen twenty three is when they said, hey, get rid of slavery. So that was a couple of decades.

00:32:49
Josh: Yeah. And Marcus Garvey, who as we'll see, played a huge role in the development of the cult of personality for Higley Selassie, was turned out to be pretty critical of him, and for one reason was because Selassie allowed slavery to continue for decades after he became the ruler of Ethiopia and Garvey. That didn't sit well with Garvey. He also called him a coward for leaving Ethiopia to go run the government in Absentia. You can definitely see both points of view for him staying or going. And it worked out because he sat back on his throne again five years to the day after the Italians invaded. But regardless of how that happened, when he came back to rule again in nineteen forty one, he was more well thought of by Ethiopians and the rest of the world alike than he was even before the Italian invasion. So he got back to modernizing again, and he put his foot on the gas I think a little harder than he should. I think he was really trying to make up for the enormous setback that the Italian occupation had created.

00:33:59
iHeart Intro: Yeah, also a lot of internal strife within Ethiopia after the United States actually stepped up and helped unite Eritrea with Ethiopia again in nineteen fifty two. One thing it did was it gave Ethiopia access to the Red Sea, which was a big deal, but it wasn't a true like unification. Eritrea remained had like an independent government in a lot of ways, still highly Selassie did not like this. He wanted more control, and in nineteen sixty two he dissolved their parliament and basically sort of annexed them, which led to the creation of the Eritrean Liberation Front the ELF and basically three decade internal civil war of you know, kind of constant uprisings within Ethiopia from the Eritreans.

00:34:53
Josh: Yeah, Eritrea finally regained its independence and I think nineteen ninety four years and years of essentially civil war. Because again we were talking at the outset of this that these were groups of different people. These were different ethnic groups that had lived in the same area but had now been put under unification. They were all now considered Ethiopians, but they had their own ethnic consciousness and they did not. A lot of them did not like being considered Ethiopians. I think the Ormo people in particular bristled at the idea the most because they had the largest population in Ethiopia. And yet the Amhara people of which Hiley Selassie was one and the whole Solomonic dynasty was from the Amhara people. They were the ones who were ruling things. So imagine that. Imagine that this other group that you've been kind of rivals with for centuries now is telling your group exactly what to do, where to live, which taxing you, is saying you're with us now, whether you like it or not. That was the kind of like internal strife that was just kind of rubbing Ethiopia at the edges throughout the entire the entirety of the highly selassies rule.

00:36:12
iHeart Intro: Yeah for sure, And like you said, he's got his foot on the gas. In the nineteen fifties, in particular, in fifty five, they passed a new, a brand new, brand spanking new, very shiny constitution, further modernizing the judiciary for one. This time, parliament was elected by the people, more human rights were guaranteed, but it was still not like a Western style democracy. Highly Selassi was still very much in charge and more popular than ever on the international stage. He's all of a sudden visiting the United States. I believe FDR invited him after World War Two, but he never went. So he finally came at Eisenhower's behest, had a ticker tape parade in Manhattan. Highly Selassie went to a Yankees game, went to Yosemite National Park, just does this big, like kind of pr tour through America. It's really interesting, Yeah for sure.

00:37:12
Josh: And again like this guy was like Americans couldn't believe what they were seeing. Like this is a time where there was still like segregation in America and here's this black African leader's who just revered in the United States. It's just like cognitive dissonance. But they were just thrilled by this guy, right, so highly Selassie ate that stuff up. He loved that. One of the big criticisms of him in retrospect, and I think even at the time, was that his preferred company were Europeans and Americans and other people of wealthy countries. That's who he liked to rub elbows with. That's who was invited to the parties that he threw in the royal palaces. He didn't he didn't seem to think that much about the people he ruled and who essentially gave him all the power that he had, that he went and used to basically enrich himself in his own image.

00:38:08
iHeart Intro: I think that's a great setup for a break.

00:38:11
Josh: Yeah, oh sure, yeah, I don't like to toot my own horn, So you just put me on the spot, all right.

00:38:18
iHeart Intro: We'll be right back after this, all right. So when we left off, you were talking about the fact that Hayley Selassie was very popular internationally, not so much or not as much at home at least like with everybody. He had factions of people who loved him in Ethiopia, but it was complicated and.

00:39:00
Josh: They were probably mostly from the Amhara ethnic group too, remember.

00:39:03
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. So he's got a situation sort of where he's getting older, he's trying to push progressive ideals that are popular with the young people, not as popular with the older guard, of course, and that creates a lot of internal strife. And he's also got this sort of ongoing problem with the Elf. All these ethnicities mixed together, there's going to be some strife. And finally, in December nineteen sixty, he was in Brazil and members of his imperial bodyguard staged a coup and they proclaimed that his son Selassie son Crown Prince Asphal Wolsen, was the new emperor. There were about four days of violence in about three hundred deaths, but it was suppressed and those leaders the formal imperial bodyguards were killed. And this really change things as far as sort of setting up the last couple of decades of Selassie's rule and reign as as basically a police state.

00:40:11
Josh: Yeah, and yet he still was a shrewd ruler, internal ruler that the coup had set up shop in the Royal Palace while he was away, and he donated that royal palace to establish the university, the first university in Ethiopia, which became a Disa Baba University, which is a highly respected university today. And so like it was a it was a really shrewd move on his part, basically placate the young intelligensia, who were definitely part of that coup, if not you know, in physically, at least in spirit. So they were they were like, Okay, we're getting a university. And at the same time, he knows he's taking his foot off the modernizing gas and he needs to basically consult his power even further, probably take them back and remind everybody that he's still emperor.

00:41:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure. One of the truly seems like great things he did was in nineteen sixty three when he led the movement to establish the Organization of African Unity THEAU, which was basically thirty two African nations that had won independence at that time getting together establishing this union, I believe it's now called the African Union. And you know, they had bold, you know, pretty great objectives. They wanted to improve life for Africans, they wanted to protect the sovereignty of the countries that had won their independence, and he was of course chosen as the first president of the OAU, And he was in his seventies at this point, like he was getting on up there in age. Yeah.

00:41:52
Josh: And it's ironic because he was like an elder statesman compared to the much younger, generally democratic leaders that were the other that made up the rest of the African Union countries, right, And they were there, all those younger rulers were there, or leaders, I should say, they weren't rulers because this wave of decolonization had been kicked off by Ghana and I think the early sixties, and so that was one of the purposes of the African Union, or at first the OAU, was to basically say, okay, we need to like level set again. This is a new continent. We're taking it back, we're setting up new governments and all that. So it's kind of ironic that Higley Selassie was the first president of the Organization of African Unity because he was exactly the kind of person who was being toppled elsewhere around Africa, except he was not toppled because he had never been colonized. Although other groups in Ethiopia considered him a colonizer. He managed to survive that wave and strangely was made the president of the OAU.

00:42:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah. I think it was just because he was such a popular worldwide popular figure, is what I can figure. So it almost seemed like it was like it was just sort of destined to be that he would be their first president, even though if they really thought about it, and I don't even know if they held a vote, actually I meant to look that up, yeah, or if he was basically just like, I'll be president, right.

00:43:23
Josh: Right, he called president first, I call it.

00:43:27
iHeart Intro: So toward the end of his run, more criticism coming him way from within Ethiopia. Their inflation is really high, there are people living in poverty. Any descent was squash squashed, Leaders of descent disappeared. He still had a positive view internationally through all of this somehow, but that was not the truth of the matter back home.

00:43:54
Josh: No, and that kind of stuff was making people bristle further and further, not just the other ethnic groups like the Oromo or the Somalis, but like even people in his own you know, his own group. They were they there was a huge problem. No matter how good a ruler. He was viewed as there was always going to be a people who were saying, it's the nineteen sixties and we still have an emperor. Can we look any more backwards? Just that alone, yeah, kind of put a time limit on how much longer he was going to rule. But then that whole kind of crackdown phase of his rule also really really had a huge hit on his popularity too among other quarters.

00:44:39
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he was like when I was thirteen, man, emperors were all the rage.

00:44:44
Josh: Yeah, that's a great point that when he came into power, that was that was normal. But he stayed in power for so long that he outlived the age of emperors.

00:44:53
iHeart Intro: Weirdly sixty something years. The other problem, or another problem, was the fact that he as emperor had a very lavish, luxurious, some say wasteful lifestyle, which was not a popular thing to do when your country is struggling in a lot of ways, certainly when they were hit by their second really huge famine at the beginning of nineteen seventy two. This was a famine in the Wallow Province where eventually, over the course of three years, by nineteen seventy five, more than I saw up to two hundred and fifty thousand, maybe two hundred thousand people died. And he's how much did he was his birthday party? Thirty something million dollars.

00:45:39
Josh: I spent thirty five million dollars on his eightieth birthday party in nineteen seventy two while this famine was going on.

00:45:46
iHeart Intro: Yeah, right in the middle of this thing, there was actual food being I'm not sure what, but there was food being produced and Walla and he was exporting it elsewhere at the time.

00:45:57
Josh: Yeah, somebody pointed out I can't remember which article it was, maybe one from London School of Economics that said, like the areas that experienced famine and Ethiopia were the ones that were the most restless against his rule.

00:46:11
iHeart Intro: Oh. Interesting, Like there was one.

00:46:13
Josh: Region that he asked the Brits the bomb in nineteen forty two while they were there, like, hey, before you go, do you mind bombing this restless region up to the north. I think it might have been the Waller region. Yeah, Like, if you messed with him, there was a good chance that you were going to suffer some sort of famine and exporting the food that you were producing. Again, feudal society, you could do that kind of thing that would be a great way to guarantee you famine. And then even without meddling in it directly, whether he did or not, he definitely tried to downplay it internally and externally because he didn't want it to tarnish his reputation. Apparently he was mad at the people in the famine stricken areas for starving because it looked it reflected badly in him.

00:47:00
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it's not a good look. So things are unraveling, and it's pretty clear that it's unraveling a lot of protesters happening. All of a sudden, the union, the labor force has gone on strike. This is in nineteen seventy four. And finally, in the summer of nineteen seventy four, a group called the DIRG, the Provisional Military Administrative Council, which were this wasn't upper military brass. They were relatively low ranking officers and officials. They seize power in nineteen seventy four. It was a coup and in September of nineteen seventy four they deposed him, placed him under house arrest and said, your son, who previously was named emperor, even though that never happened, was named emperor once again for a very short time, from the summer of seventy four to March of seventy five, when the DIRG abolished the Ethiopian monarchy altogether.

00:48:01
Josh: Yes, so highly. Selassie is still living in the Royal Palace, but now he's under house arrest essentially, and the DIG this new government is led by a guy named Mangiestu hall Mariam, and they created what was known as a Red Terror like they essentially said we're no, no, committed tons and tons of war crimes like killed thousands of people, tortured tens of thousands of more, and basically said we're not We're not with the US any longer. We're now with the Soviet Union and we're just redoing everything in the most bloody way possible. Unfortunately, they held power for the next twenty years. It wasn't until they were deposed in nineteen ninety four and replaced by a more democratic government that they were charged with all the horrible atrocities that they had. But long before that happened, while the DIRG was just brand new, Holly Selassie was reported as dead, I think in August of nineteen seventy five. He was found dead in his little apartment in the Royal Palace, and the leaders were like, yeah, he had a prostate operation a couple of months ago and probably was a complication from that, but anyway, it's Ethiopian tradition to bury people within twenty four hours, so we're going to do it in twelve.

00:49:19
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it was. I think that the inside story was that he was strangled by Dirk soldiers. It seems pretty obvious he was gotten rid of. I think there were some people that said that he was in the Crown Prince. Actually his son said, you know, he was in pretty good help as far as I knew before he died, So I know he was eighty three, but he was not dying. No.

00:49:45
Josh: There was another long standing rumor that he had been smothered with a pillow. But yes, in just the way that he had dispatched the Empress before him. It seems he had been dispatched as well by the Dirk. And then in probably the most insulting way your remains can be handled. They found that after Mariam was deposed in nineteen ninety two, that he had been buried under the laboratory in the Royal Palace.

00:50:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, with a v laboratory.

00:50:18
Josh: Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

00:50:20
iHeart Intro: You said, laboratory.

00:50:21
Josh: No.

00:50:21
iHeart Intro: No, So that is highly Silassie. But we of course have to close by talking about reggae, right.

00:50:29
Josh: Yeah, because there's a lot of people out there, especially in Jamaica, who said he didn't really die and those weren't his bones that they found and reburied.

00:50:37
iHeart Intro: Yeah. If you you know, we mentioned early in the thing Rastafari. Rastafarian theology is basically a reference to his identity as God as the Messiah. African descended people in Jamaica had combined elements of Christianity other different religions in Africa. And this is also during the Back to Africa movement when there were you know, potentially some people in Jamaica that were like, no, we need to go back to the homeland.

00:51:08
Josh: Yeah, and I said, Marcus Garvey figures big into the cold of personality around Holly Selassie. That's largely because in the nineteen twenties, Marcus Garvey predicted that when a black king shall be crowned in Africa, the day of deliverance is at hand and that basically black people would be free, and that Ethiopia was that whole location that you wanted to go to if you were going back to Africa. And it just had a huge impact on Jamaica in part because on Coronation Day the rains came that ended a long standing drought in Jamaica, and they were like, man, this Garvey cat knows what he's talking about. And they became hyper focused on Holly Selassie. So his Coronation Day was the holiest day or is the holiest day November second in the Rastafarian religion. And we keep saying religion and theology. That's because Rastafarians believed that Holly Selassee was God incarnate and still is if you believe that he didn't actually die and that he followed in a line of I can't remember an ancient priest, Jesus and then Holly Selassie were the incarnations of God here on earth.

00:52:20
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and he never claimed to be that. I think I've seen that he didn't expressly deny it either. I think he only went to Jamaica one time though, so it wasn't like I don't know, it's a very interesting thing that I don't fully understand, to be honest.

00:52:39
Josh: Well, that time that he went to Jamaica in nineteen sixty three. That's the second holiest day in the Rastafarian religion. They call it ground Nation Day. And one hundred thousand Rastafarians showed up, and we're just like trying to tear the plane apart to get him out of there, because they wanted to see him so badly, like it was a big deal. And because so the Rasafarians had generally been mocked and made fun of by other Jamaicans for the last few decades, like they've been following Highy Selassie as their savior for thirty years by then, And after he came and Jamaica got to see, like, oh, this guy's actually pretty cool. A lot more people became Rastafarians, including one woman named Rita Anderson who converted after Holly Selassie's visit and she became Rita Marley.

00:53:28
iHeart Intro: Yeah, oh man, this one was a lot.

00:53:32
Josh: It was a lot. Yeah, And he lives on in reggae. If you want to learn more about Holly Selassie, you can listen to a bunch of reggae. You can go read historical accounts, you can read all sorts of stuff about him, and you'll get just this hugely complex, complicated picture.

00:53:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, for sure, I hope he did a good job. You know what this one did is it as I was researching it, it laid bare just how little African history you're taught in an American school.

00:54:03
Josh: Yeah. I mean that's one of the reason we wanted to do this, is just to kind of shake that up a little bit at least.

00:54:08
iHeart Intro: Oh no, for sure. But usually when we're researching other types of history, it's like, yeah, I've sort of heard this here and there. I don't fully remember, but like, this was a ground up learning experience for me. I knew nothing about the history of Ethiopia, so really interesting stuff it is.

00:54:25
Josh: Is also kind of exciting too, because that means that there's a whole continent with the rich history that we haven't even begun to tap into. You know, yeah, totally look out for more in twenty twenty four. That's right, if you want to know more about Highley Selassie. I think I just explained how you could do that, which means that we've already I guess begun.

00:54:44
iHeart Intro: Listener mail, that's right. This is on ap classes from our episode on What was that specifically about?

00:54:56
Josh: I think that was the pig Malian Effect episode.

00:54:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Hey, guys, I'm a high school teacher at a public school in suburban Cincinnata. I currently teach AP human geography and AP World History. I've also taught APUs history, AP government, and AP psychology in the past. Just so you know, the big trend and AP across the country the last decade plus has been to open it up to as many students as possible. We still have a teacher, we still have teacher recommendations for AP class at our school, but if any kid wants to take a certain AP class, they can. For the most part, classes like AP human geography are certainly more accessible for a lot of students in a class that requires a lot of prerequisite knowledge like apchemistry. In general, though, AP classes have changed a lot since the nineties and are far less exclusive than they once were. And of course, I'm sure it was like this and you were there. You had a test to get into an AP class, right.

00:55:51
Josh: Oh yeah, yeah, they just thought they didn't stink at at all.

00:55:56
iHeart Intro: That's right. Thanks for all you do, guys. Listen to all the episodes and I include what I learned from you into my classes. Whenever I can. And that is from Connor teacher in Cincinnati.

00:56:09
Josh: That's awesome. I really hope that some of those AP teachers who thwarted me time and time again are alive to see that our work is being used in AP classes. That's right, man, what a turn of events.

00:56:21
iHeart Intro: Huh you showed them.

00:56:23
Josh: If you want to be like Connor and give us some great information that will just make our day. We love to hear that kind of stuff. You can wrap it up, spank it on the bottom, and send it off to stuff podcast at iHeartRadio dot com.
