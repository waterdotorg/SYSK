Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know? From House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, uh and that makes this stuff you should know? What Criterion Collection? What are you doing tonight? Buddy? What am I doing tonight? What am I doing tonight? I know what you're doing. What I know what we're doing? Oh yeah, tonight, tonight tonight. So not like tonight in our physical new temporality, I mean tonight in the future. Yes, like as of like someone listening to this, it would be there tonight, I would say, possibly on October twelve. I am going to be at the Drunken UNI. That's right, the Drunken Unicorn on East Paul Stallion Avenue in Atlanta, at the n j q CO of course. Yes, sort of hard to find if you don't know where what you're looking for. Well, this is what you do. You go along Ponce until you see the murder Kroger. You left or right, depending on where you're coming from. Chipotle opposite the murder Kroger on the other side of Ponce and Um, behind that is m j Q. Yes. Beside that is Friends on Ponts the bar never been I'll take you there. It's gonna blow your socks off. Uh. And then below Friends is m j Q. Yes, a very little nondescript door, gray steel door. I think some steps down and I don't think there's any signage whatsoever. Chuck. We may have to have stand outside and be like here, everybody, why are there. We're going to be there because our house band, the Henry Clay People, are going to be playing there. And this is kind of the unofficial kickoff for a big trivia event night, which is tomorrow Tomorrow night, which is October, Yes, and that is at the Five Seasons Brewery West Side on Marietta Street. And it is gonna be fun. I'm getting excited. I'm getting pretty excited. It's gonna be pretty cool. We have actor and author and former literary agent John Hodgman, and we have former Dukes of Hazzard co star Joe Randazzo, and we have Squidbillies co creator and Aquitine Hunger Force co creator Dave Willis. I've been really getting into squid Billies. Yeah, it's awesomely wrong. I don't know if he still has it or not an original um squid billies oil painting on wood, and I don't I haven't talked to him in a while, so I don't know if they've will actually painted it, but I mean it is dead on, so I need to ask him, do you also paint? I was watching last night and Earl the Dad Squid had he always has on different baseball caps that say different retenick things, and one of them beware in big letters and then in small little letters that said good stuff. Good stuff. So there's your chance to come out and meet John and Joe and Dave and Us and Jerry and uh that there'll be other podcasters there, imagine the ones that don't hate us will be there. So Strickland Struggle will be there, Strickland will be there, hopefully some other people. Yeah, so we invite everyone to come out six o'clock doors Trivia starts at seven. The Henry Clay People shows one of those later shows, but we encourage you to come. And that's on Tuesday Trivias on Wednesday season Brewer west Side experience some rock and or roll and then some fun trivia and Chuck. Also, you can look up our event on Facebook and there there's all sorts of details and directions and stuff on absolutely yeah check it out, um the stuff you should know trivia event page. And this is the last you will hear of this. That's it. And then what we may be going on a national tour. We're almost definitely going to Austin. It's so funny, like everyone else is so sick of hearing this, but I guarantee you we will get people on that Thursday on Facebook. That's say, well, I never heard anything about your trick, and we'll just be like, go buy a tech hammer at your local Ace Hardware. Take it home, Yes, put the receipt in the garbage can and smack yourself in the forehead with it. Don't return it after all. Right, on with the show, On with the show, Chuck's plug Fest two thousand ten for now. Yeah, So, Chuck, I've got a story for you, alright, story time. Okay, So remember when we were talking about roller Derby's um and there was that whole Transcontinental roller Derby where it was really just a roller rink that people went around fifty seven thousand times for eleven hours a day until they passed out. So I know that that you know that there's all sorts of a thons or what they call what they're called, what they used to be called. People like to just do stuff to the extreme test their endurance. Right, dance a thons, um, hunt nazis a thons. Just anything you could think of in like the forties, fifties and thirties. Well, um, staying awake was not immune to the athon fever. Um. There's a guy in the nineteen fifty nine. He's thirty two years old at the time. His name is Peter Tripp, and he's a disc jockey in New York City, New York City. Yeah, and um, he made a little studio in the storefront and said I'm going to stay awake for as long as I can. And he did. And while he's doing it, oh yeah, he did for two one straight hours. Wow. Yeah, Um he did. This is kind of a mark against him as far as stay awake a thonors or than enthusiasts. But he was given him feta means by two physicians to keep him up. Physicians. But the guy, yeah, well back in those days, Joey in the corner, Yeah, his physicis. Um. I was gonna say, back in those days, you know, like you like doctors prescribed to anything, and I thought, oh, yeah, nothing's changed, right, Um, But he stayed awake for two d one hours, assisted by amphetamans, but still right. Quite an accomplishment it was, and it stood for a while as I think the longest to anyone ever stayed awake, and then people started topping it and topping it, and then finally in nineteen four, there was a teenager in San Diego, which is a town I know you love, uh, And his name was Randy Gardner and he's actually still around. That kid stayed up with nothing, no assistance whatsoever, for two hundred and sixty four hours on purpose to try and set the record. Yeah, for a science fairs. It was a science experiment, and the guy ended up setting the world record for a while. I bet he hallucinated like crazy. Now, yes, here's the thing, Um, I think Randy had a bit of a hard time. He um had something kind of a some sort of psychotic break here there. Um. Peter Tripp particularly had a hard time, especially because of the amphetamines he hallucinated. UM. Cats chasing mice in the little studio. I thought one of the desk drawers that um he was seated at where it was on fire. A man uh showed up in a dark suit, and he confused him for an undertaker and ran out because it was an undertaker probably um. So yeah, there's all sorts of horrible stuff associated with sleep deprivation. I don't like it. Bear with me, I'm with you. We're about to get to the want, Want Want moment. Okay. In two thou seven you may remember there was a guy named um Mr Wright. I can't remember Mr Wright's first name, can you, Tony? He was from Cornwall, England? Oh yeah, I stayed up for eleven days pub in Cornwall, playing pool, just hanging out. We did down the webcast right. Yes, he broke the record and I'm making air quotes here. He broke um Randy um Gardner's record. What he didn't know is that a year after Randy Gardner set the record, a guy in Finland beat Randy Gardner's records. So two problems here, Tony Wright didn't actually beat the world record, And the second part is in Guinness stopped acknowledging the world records for staying awake the longest because of health reasons. So Tony Wright stayed awake for eleven days for absolutely nothing. Well, he got a lot of coverage and he was a national hero in Wales from what I understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would have looked into that beforehand. I would have called Guinness, the Guinness people. Yeah. One of his friends's quota is saying like, we've never heard of this guy in Finland. His name was Tomoy so annoy No, toy me, that's got it. I've got it. His name is Toymi Soyny of Finland. I've never heard of him either, and that's a name you wouldn't forget. No, but thank you for bearing with me through that horribly long introduction. That was good. My point was this, we have this weird obsession with staying awake sometimes, right, it's it's well, some people do. It's it's like an endurance contest. And the guy in New York, Peter Tripp, was assisted by amphetamines. These days, there's entirely new classes of drugs that are designed to keep us awake. Right, Yes, they're called drugs. I don't want anywhere near me. So Chuck, you you were big on sleeping. Right, Well, yeah, but I don't. I don't sleep like Emily sleep. She can sleep. Yeah, I mean I'm still you know, you get older, you start waking up early no matter what. So even if I have a late night at like two am, I'm still up at seven. Yes, okay, but you still require sleep. Yes, I for one am alarmed at the concept of synthetically phasing sleep out, even if we don't need it, even if we figure out how to get asked without sleep, it just seems wrong. Well it is. You know. We'll talk a bit more about that, because I have pretty strong feelings about messing with you know, your natural human biology. Now, we do already chuck through things like caffeine, speed, we stay awake. I know you're huge on speed greenies. Not true, absolutely not true. Um, but what are these things do to you? There's problems, there's side effects, right, but there's a problem. Yeah, caffeine. Um, although there are studies now that say that caffeine can be good for you in certain amounts, But caffeine can make you crash, it can give you diarrhea, it can make you really irritable. If you don't get your caffeine in your system, and the same with amphetamines. You have a serious crash after an amphetamine high. Yes, and that's not what you're looking for. No, that's called sleep debt. Yeah, and you gotta pay it back with amphetamines, right, So sleep for half a day if you've been up on Greenies? Yes, Um, I think when did Greenies? That was big and major League Baseball they called him Greenies? Is that a bunch of baseball players used to them being called Benny's a lot of Caro aquinos in high school's Yeah, that's short for Ben's a dream. Yeah. Yeah, So that's the bad effects of caffeine and sleepitteriness, diarrhea. Plus the problem is that you're being kept awake. You're awake, but you're not There's no rest whatsoever. Yeah, your body is not getting used to it or anything. No, and your mental faculties begin to decline pretty rapidly once it starts, right, So, Chuck, what's somebody who wants to stay up? It doesn't feel like getting addicted to speed going to do? What can you do? Well, Josh? You should try madefanel. What's medeffanel? It is a sort of new drug. What is it about? Twelve? Years old in total. No, some French researchers were even cats in the early nineties, but it's really kind of taken off for human use beginning in ninety I think it's Uh. It's in a class of drugs called eugeroics, yeah, which is Greek for quote good arousal. Yeah. So the idea here is that you can stay awake uh with medeffanel and it goes like all drugs, it goes by like a dozen different names, and you don't have a sleep debt. That's pretty amazing. It is. Um. What's more, it's in this This article was written by Julia Layton on March seventh, two thousand seven. It has quite a bit um. It's at the time at two thousand and seven, medaffanel was like this promise of the future. Um. And and not only no side effects, no addictiveness. Um. All of this stuff has been proven untrue over time. And it's actually I've read one study that found that medaffanel for use and shift to workers late shift workers, it kept them awake one point seven minutes longer than a placebo. Yeah, so it may not even work. But um, let's let's take the two thousand seven view of my daffa. No first, Okay, okay, so it's non addictive. How could that possibly be? Well, it can't, but sorry, we're back in time. This is well, are we explaining how it works? Um? Specifically, it doesn't do what caffeine and emphetamines do, things like blocking uh neuro receptors that triggered drowsiness. UM one's called a dinna scene and they block the receptors that bind to it. Caffeine does, and so it will keep you awake basically because you're not feeling tired. Right. So, like your neurotransmitters, all of our neurotransmitters function by a release and then they float around and have their effect and then they're they're taken back up uptake re uptake. Yeah, well, in dopamine plays a big part two in both of these, right. But with with the neurotransmitter, including dopamine, you can activate its release and or prevent its reuptake, so you're either flooding the brain with it and or keeping it in the brain longer. Right. Well, and that's what amphetamines too, specifically, is they give the dopamine nowhere to go, so you're just euphork sounds pretty good to me. It does sound good. But the problem is is your brains like, oh, you want to play that game, huh, while I'm just gonna withhold dopamine unnaturally, So you're gonna be depressed for three or four days. Okay. So that's how you get addicted to something. Though, anytime dopamine is released artificially in the brain, your body loves it, right, And that's here's the problem. You're Dopamine is the centerpiece of the brain's reward system. It's how we learn to eat and have sex, to reproduce or have sex for whatever reason, and anything that gives us a sense of pleasure. Dopa means involved, and we're taught we're motivated to repeat that behavior through the release of dopamine. So if we drink caffeine or take speed or do cocaine or whatever, and dopamins released, we're taught to do it again, which is the basis of addiction, which, by the way, I think we should do a podcast on just addiction. Yeah, it's a really interesting about that how addiction works. Well, let's do it. Okay, let's do it right now. Alright, you're ready, I'm not prepared. So that's how those other uh well in two thousand seven, more nefarious drugs would help keep you awake, and um, medefanel didn't do that for some reason. It activated dopamine, but just maybe not as much, right, And they believe that medefanel actually targets a neurotransmitter G A B A. We'll just call it gabba gabba, gabba gabba, and that is the sleep regulator of the brain. And it seemed to slow down uh gabba's release. So basically your brain at it now that hey, it's time to go to sleep now, right, like your circadian rhythms thrown off, right, Yeah, So it's specifically targeted that and well not that alone, because it did release a little bit of dopamine, right, it did, But what they were saying was like it's just such a little amount that you're not becoming addicted like it does. But you're not becoming addicted. Don't worry about it. Um gaba is not the only and there's also um from what I found, there's four types of gab gabba and apparently like gab before is like the most sensitive one, and that's like the real it's the trux of research right now is trying to figure out GABBA or GABA four um. But in addition to GABA, there's also histamines which make us drowsy. That's why antihistamines can jet you up. UM. And there's also glutamate, and glutamate is um basically the brain's natural speed, right um. So they think that I think they figured it out by now. But two thousand seven thought was that the the medaffanel prevented the reuptake of glutamate, which keeps you alert and functioning right. Yeah. And the end result of all this is what they found was a miracle drug, is what they called it, because there was no sleep that when you came off of um this drug, you didn't need to sleep for a half a day to catch up on things. You would just go back and fall into your regular pattern and be all rested. Yeah it sounds great. Yeah, it does sound great. I mean staying up for four day hours and then just being able to get an average eight hour night sleep and you're fine. I mean, why why wouldn't you want to do that? Me personally, Well, we'll get to that later. Well we should say too though, that it was developed to treat U narcolepsy specifically, right, and we should probably talk about this. There's a company called Cephalon, and Cephalon took Madeffanel and marketed the heck out of it as a pro vagil and provagil. According to a two thousand two New York Times article, we read UM said call said that um. It means provides vigilance. Right, And basically it was adopted for off label use by everyone from college students to the CEO of of UM Cephalon. Yeah, what's uh, Frank Cabaldino. Frank Baldino, he took it and he didn't say why he was taking it. No, but the only thing it's approof for is NARCILEPSI is a treatment of narcilepsy. They've tried to get it a proof for jet lag, they tried to get it a proof for shift workers UM syndrome. They tried to get it a proof for general drowsiness tiredness UM and they couldn't that. THEA was like, no, we'll let you sell this for narcilepsy, to treat narcileptics. The problem is it's not how it wor right. Well, the problem is there's only about two thousand narcileptics in the United States. So Cephalon is like, we need to get this out there, and they started marketing it off label. It's kind of nefariously as well. Yeah, it became a lifestyle drug, is what they classified it as. Yeah, UM a new tropic and O O T R O P I C, which means it's it's another name for smart drug, like trans humanists love new tropics. Yes, all those farmer names were so like, I don't know, they rubbed me the wrong way. So like I said, uh, nefarious, I'm basing this nefarious nous on UM. This really great article, Chuck. There's two parts called UM The Rise and Fall of Provigil, and it's by UM investigative journalist Evelyn Pringle, And I think everybody should read this. It's really interesting. This is hot off like yesterday it was released. I think, yeah, it was hot off the press. How how odd is that I know that you picked this, Yeah, because I had no idea that this was written yesterday and we picked it like two days before a week before. Anyway, in the article, she talks about how um Cephalon had UM physicians that they were underwriting. It didn't reveal their relationship to the company. But we're saying, like, this is a great drug and it should be used for all these off market purposes. Stuff that if the company had done it, they would have been prosecuted federally. There was a and the Attorney General of Pennsylvania oversaw a bunch of lawsuits and the company hired him as executive legal counsel. Yeah, just all sorts of stuff like that. There's allegations of UM paid to delay UM programs with UH, with their competitors that they found that of the prescriptions written had nothing to do with an ecalepsy. Yeah, it was depression, MS, sleepiness, and like you said, the shift workers syndrome. They were prescribing it for all kinds of things, basically to make you feel better. They had their UM reps actually visiting psychiatrists, dentists were prescribing this stuff. Yeah, UM. And and again two arcileptics of them were on the drug within a year of its release, right, Yeah, And it just wasn't enough. Well, and then that's when they started jacking up the price, when they found out that people really love this stuff. From November to March it rose in price and it was seventy seventy percent more expensive than it was four years previous in two thousand four, and I think it topped out at like thirteen eighteen dollars a pill. That is insane. And the long and short of all this, as of this week, the European Medicines Agency basically came out and said, you know what, you can't use this for anything but narcolepsy, because we have found out that there are certain psychiatric disorders this causes, like suicidal thoughts and depression in psychotic episodes and potentially life threatening skin reactions. And also, first, I'm sorry, you're right it topped out at thirteen sixty two a pill when it was originally five dollars and fifty three cents a pill for no reason whatsoever. It just rose and costs in the US make money, UM, and you were talking king about the psychiatric disorders that it exacerbated. They basically reformulated um MD affodel into a kid's version for the treatment of a d h D, and they found that what would be the equivalent in the in the UM actual population of one in about two hundred or no. Twenty in a hundred cases of things like psychotic breaks, suicidal thoughts and children. And this drug, it was called Sparlon, was taken out of FDA testing. They just dropped it. Yeah. Well, and not only that, but it's supposedly non addictive. Not so. In two thousand nine, a psychiatrist an addiction specialists said UH to USA Today that he had seen his third case of probagil addiction and UM two doctors back to back admitted that they were addicted to it and they were also alcoholics. Right, And it's kind of interesting. I guess. So the hammer kind of all down on um munafodil and cephalon kind of simultaneously. It's currently falling. It sounds like, yeah, the um FTC has a lawsuit. There's UM. I think three different employees turned whistleblow around the company and file lawsuits against it UM. And then yeah, that psychiatrists came out in USA today and said that he was treating people for addiction to it, which is huge. And then Bloomberg also the same day, Bloomberg News released a report about its addictiveness. But it's really interesting to read the stuff that's going on now compared to our two thousand seven articles that I think probably should be taken down and rewritten pretty soon because it's basically claims it's a wonder drug, like, yeah, it makes it actually compared it to viagran and says it's better because you don't get five hour erections, right or worse depending on your viewpoint. Uh So, Josh, that is just one drug that we have picked out, but that is not the whole story of science phasing out sleep. Yeah, and this, this whole podcast isn't intended to to target cephalon. It was just really interesting that we ran across this during our research. And again, I think you should read um The Rise and Fall of Provigil by Evelyn Pringle. Just look it up online. I think it's up there for free, right. Yeah, it's a good one. So, uh, Munafodel is not the only thing, like you said, targeting sleep. There's another drug from Cortex, the pharmaceutical company called c X seven seventeen, and it works sort of like the other one, and that it keeps you awake by triggering glutamate activity and specifically triggers that and it also targets histamine, so it sort of works in the same way. But science is all over. What they're trying to do is they're trying to research and see if they can get people by on less sleep with the same effects as having a full nine a sleep. That seems to be the goal. Get three hours of sleep, but your body feel is like it got eight hours, and not only hours, the best eight hours bets and it's safe. It can't be addictive, which means it can't have any effect on your reward system, so no dopamine could be released, right, Um, and that what you were talking about c X seventeen seven seventeen. C X seven seventeen. It's an amp keene. That's the class of drug and like you said, it targets the reuptake. A glutamate has nothing to do with the reward system as far as we know right now, And that's the one that DARP was looking into. DARP is leading the way they're driving this sleep deprivation research because you know it's military, yes, and apparently the special ops guys have to stay up for seventy two straight hours usually with very very little, if any rest, and be sharp enough to you know, assassinate somebody. Um, well, the military did a lot of testing on nafadel. Yes, and this is the this is a I can't remember what article it was, but somebody talked to a Darper research true who said, we we found it was about as good as caffeine, which is weird. Like, I don't understand because this, the article that Layton wrote, is saying like this has a huge following. People swear by the stuff. It clearly did and probably still does. So I don't understand how clinical results could show it's no better than caffeine while other people are like, this is the greatest thing ever. Well, it could be the placebo going on again. I guess it could be. With the military though, they would give it to these pilots for a couple of days, make them stay awake, and then have them go out and fight their fighter jet and just to see what happened, and they found that after that it did. It did a good job till about the forty eight hour point, and then after that, regardless of what you're on, your body is going to start showing effects of sluggishness and maybe hallucinations and the things that you don't want if you're a fighter pilot, no, or just a regular guy trying to make a living in this world. Exactly. There was a two thousand ninth study, Munofadel actually did contribute to our understanding of the human brain. Um. Some researchers that you see Davis slapped people into a wonder machine, loaded them up on munofadel, kept them awake, and watched their brain, and they saw heightened activity in the locusts ceruleus. I can't imagine being in a wonder machine for two days straight. I think they probably sleep deprived him and then probably towards the end of the second day or something they put them I don't know. But they also gave them tests and found that that some tests have found that people actually do better on psychological tests, tests of skill, feats of strength, you know, festivus stuff um on munofadel. Then they do, you know, just awake or on caffeine or in photomanes or something like that. So that mixed results. But we didn't know what part of the brain was keeping people awake or was subject to sleep deprivation, and now we do it's the locus ceruleus. So that's probably going to play a role in this endless quest to do away with sleep, right part of it. Yeah, it's not just drugs either. They're looking for a sleep gene. That one's really interesting to me, don't you think take it away? Because drugs are drugs. But they believe that there are people that can get by on less sleep, that they're called short sleepers. About one in a thousand people can function just fine on a few hours asleep. They don't need a big eight or nine hours. And uh, they believe it's hereditary and they're trying to find this gene so they can tweak it and make us all into short sleeper so wet all get more stuff done? Yeah, and there's um, there's actually a species of fruit fly that is a short sleeper fruit fly and it has a mutation. And what they found is a mutation has to do with potassium channels. No one knows exactly what yet, but that's interesting because there's an autoimmune deficiency or an autoimmune disease called more Vans syndrome and people in more vents and people with more Van syndrome have trouble sleeping. And there's uh, their syndrome has a affects the transport of potassium through sheell membranes. So there's a tie there for sure. Definitely. So it has something to do with bananas. Is that where this is all headed. I guess fruit flies potassium. Oh my god. So if they find this gene, I think what they're looking for as a future where people can um program their lifestyle how they want it. If you're if you want to work eighty hours a week and work till four am and get up at seven, maybe there's a pill that can help you do that with no side effects. Maybe I don't. What I find alarming is that sleep, um like sleep being synthetically reduced or eliminated natural sleep. Even among sleep researchers who are like, this is a horrible, horrible idea, they still say it's inevitable. And apparently the predictions are like ten to twenty years off, where we either have a pill that we can take and sleep for three hours but feel like we slept for a and keep going, or we won't have to sleep at all. Um. The problem is remember John Maynard Keynes, the economists, and he came up with the leisure society in the nineteen thirties. He was like, people in a hundred years won't even have to work, and we'll all just sit around and and have fun. He was right about us being wealthy and having more leisure time. But what he missed the mark on was that we don't spend our leisure time on leisure now, we'd spent it trying to acquire more wealth. So why why would you possibly want to have a twenty two hour day of wakefulness? The whole point of our eight hour work day is to divide the day into three parts, eight hours working, eight hours of leisure time, which we now spend vacuuming and going to the grocery store, and eight hours for sleep. I find it really discouraging to think that we're going in that direction to where we're carving at the eight hours. We've already done away with the eight hours of leisure your time, and now we're going after sleep. Would mistake. I think it's a huge mistake. But there are some people out there that would love to be able to only get three hours of sleep at night and all the stuff that they could get done. Ah, I don't know, man, I mean, what is there to do from two am to five am? Oh? They'll be I mean, first of all, you got taco bell, right, so you can go to taco Bell. It's one thing. There's all sorts of stuff you can do. But imagine if everybody else is up. Well, that's true. And I guess if if they build a twenty four hour society like New York City, those freaks in that town, it would there would be more things, would be, libraries open, businesses would be open, everything would be open for twenty four hours. Everything would go to shift work. The key here is, if we're going to do that, don't ever ever agree to a salaried position. Always always make it hourly or else you're just in big trouble. Yeah, so I say no, thank you, I do too, chuckers um. Also, if the pills don't work, if they don't find the sleep gene, they've got this one thing. It's called brain polarization. Remember transcranial magnetic stimulation. How could I forget? Okay, So this is called the poor man's version of that, where rather than using electromagnetism, it uses a DC current to jolt your brain awake. Oh that's that machine. So look for that. Look for a future where you're you have a cattle prod in your brain so you can work longer. You think, really sleep, I'm falling asleep and it feels so good. Yeah, Oh, I feel great and I can get some more spreadsheets done. Yes. Uh, if there's going to be any future for humanity, we have to rail against this, everybody. So let's stand together. Else, everyone go to sleep. You should probably go onto how stuff works dot com and read the hilariously out of date is Science Phasing out sleep, type in phasing and sleep in the search bar at how stuff works dot Com. That will take you elsewhere. Also, don't forget the Rise and Fall of Provigil p R O V I g I L by Evelyn Pringle, and also the Stay Awake Men on the New York Times. It was an opinion calum written by Thomas Bartlett. Pretty good stuff, just his opinion. Yeah, all right, it's time for what listener mail? Do we have listener mail? Yeah? We do. Let's do it. The return of listener Mail Josh. And this is specific to our trivia night because it is about Aquitine Hunger course awesome. This is from Kate and Hunter, who are married. Hey, guys, when I heard that the creator of Aquitine would be joining your trivia festival and Trivia Festival, I felt compelled to write you guys to tell you of how that show changed my life. I was in my junior year of college, when I went to a potluck dinner at a friend's apartment. I met a sweet, handsome and funny guy there and we chatted most of the evening. At the end of the night, he mentioned aquitine. He did his meat Wad voice and asked if I'd like to go over to his place and watch a t H because he had season one on DVD. It's like the Etchings of the Century. You want to come inspect to my place? My Actually, he's a very smooth character. We stayed up all night watching the show, laughing and talking. Two years later, we were spending our date night watching a t H and eating pizza when he proposed to me. When we were planning our wedding, we wanted to put meat Wad and Master Shake on top of the cake asaid homage to their role in our meeting with Frylock as the minister, but we couldn't find any little figures of them. We tried several times to get in touch with someone connected to the show see if they could hook us up or tell us where we could buy them, but we never had any luck. Our wedding was perfect anyway, and we've been married close to three years now. Needless to say, we still love Aquitine. So if you guys think to share our story with Dave Willis, tell him thank you for us from Kate and Hunter and this is our way of sharing it. And I hope everybody is listening to our show. Yeah, I wonder if he does now now that he's like, oh, I didn't know these guys existed. I guess I'll listen to him since I'm playing Betty he checked it out and uh may have listened to poor episode and never tuned an again, or maybe he's our number one fan. Now. Yeah, I think that's a great story, And I for one think that they should manufacture the characters from Aquatine Hunger Force, like remember the little figurings. Yeah, perfect size handy. You know, back in the day when South Park first came on, I made uh little Sculpi. You know what Sculpi is, very sculpie. It's like Plato and Clay, but you can bake it in your oven at home. Yeah, yeah, sculp I made little Sculpie South Park guys, because they didn't exist at the time. It was so new and people are like, oh my gosh, where'd you get those? And said I made him? And then you know they started mass manufacturing South Park and everything after that. Anyway, I would have recommended to Kate and Hunter to get sculpie and make your frylock and master shaking meat one. They're pretty demanding. They like things to just be kind of given to him, and it sounds like it. Well. Thanks Kate, Thanks Hunter Mozeltov on your wedding.
