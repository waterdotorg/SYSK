Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant. Jerry's over there. Chuck's wearing his Last Chance garage hat, which means that all is right with the world. You know, Chuck's not wearing that hat. Who knows what's going on? There's I thought a loss this thing. Yeah, yeah, I think I vaguely remember that that freak was the Delta and everything, and I was like, oh, here it is. It's on my head in your back pocket with Bruce Springsteen. That's right. Uh, how you doing great? Um? Chuck, Yes, I think you knew this, but I'm not sure everybody listening does. Um. If you if you like not you, Chuck put people out there. I'm speaking to you now. If you like hanging out with us on the podcast, you can hang out with this outside of the podcast too. You know. Some people are like, can you release a podcast every day? No we can't, but we do hang out on Twitter, Facebook that kind of thing every day. Yes, we do every day. Our Twitter handle is s y SK podcast Facebook dot com, Slash Stuff you Should Know. Yeah, we're trying to get up over a hundred thousand likes on Facebook, so close. So if you could like us and then just hide us if you don't like us, I don't even think you need to hide us, like I think eight percent of people get any given posts. It varies something like that though, right, So, I mean I think you will seek us out though, rather than hiding us because it's in an entertaining page. We like to deliver the goods. Yeah, and then of course you can hang out with us on our website stuff you should know dot com where we have blogs, slide shows, we post our podcasts there, videos, it's like the the Josh and Chuck video network. Agreed. Okay, so they're all right. Now let's talk about electricity. Electricity, electricity. I've had the talking Head song in my head, which one electricity where all these sees or little dots. I thought you're gonna say once in a lifetime. No, that's what is that called? Once in a lifetime? Yeah? Uh yeah, I've been singing the Schoolhouse Rock electricity song over and over in my head. What about the electric company theme song? M I haven't been singing that, but do you remember it? Yeah? That was that was Electric Company over Sesame Street. Even Oh, yeah, I didn't think there had to be like a you know, I didn't know it was like the Stones or the Beatles. You know. No, it's uh in the correct answer, there's the Who. By the way, what do you mean is that right now? I mean, yeah, I love the Who, but I'm with you. I don't see the need to rank things like that. Well, Plus, the Electric Company came on after Sesame Street. I think, yeah, excwed slightly older. I think Sesame Street to me felt like, you know, seven eight year olds. Electric companies were like eight, nine, ten, twelve. And then even younger than Sesame Street was pin Wheel if I remember correctly, that was after your time. Pinwell was pretty cute. It was like little kids, and the Sesame Street was like little kids, and then Electric Company was like cool and Romper Room was kind of pre Sesame Street. Even so, Was that the one with Reggedy, Ann and Andy? I don't remember. I just remember it was. It's very immature, Yeah, three childish you think Reggedy, Ann and Andy were in that? Well, at any rate, we've angered enough people now, I know. Uh, I have an intro for this one. Okay, you ready, about thirteen point eight billion years ago, a little something called the Big Bang happened and the universe was created, so says you. So this there's a lot of people. You know, we weren't around. Nobody saw it, but it's been detected and it's strongly suspected by scientists that the universe is thirteen point eight billion years old and that it came from something called the Big Bang, which, by the way, I would love to do an episode on Okay, um and under the auspices of the Big Bang theory, not the TV show, but the actual theory. UM. At that moment, all of the energy in the entire universe was created right then, boom bam. Ever since that point that energy has no more energy has been created and none of that energy has been destroyed. But it changes states, that changes shapes, that can be locked up in different um places. It can be transferred from one place to another via some natural ways like convection, conduction, radiation, UM. And like I said, it can be stored and stuff like it can be stored in your body. Right. Fat is potential energy that can be burned and used for energy to carry out work, which is all we're looking to do is work. We use energy to carry out work, whether it's digging a shovel or lighting a light bulb. That's what energy does. It produces work, right, Yeah, okay, um, we figured out along the way that we don't have to wait around for radiation or convection or conduction to do its thing to provide energy, because we'd have a lot of waiting to do. We wouldn't be in the computer age right now if it weren't for something called electricity, which is basically how humans have figured out how to harness converting energy from one type of another and then transmitting it a very long distance. Because electricity isn't a primary energy source like the sun or solar radiation or nuclear energy or even the flow of water kinetic energy. Yeah, it's and and it's a secondary energy source. It's a carrier, that's right. So electricity carries energy from one point to another. And if you understand that, you understand the very bay cyst of while we're gonna talk about today, like we've figured out how to generate electricity to carry energy to produce work down the line, that's right. That's my intro which is usually Mechanical energy is what's produced by machine. Yes, so think about this, like, if you capture mechanical energy like water spinning a turbine, which we'll talk about, and Niagara falls, that's not gonna do anything to light your light bulb, uh, two miles away, not by itself. No, unless you connected to you send the the work produced, the energy captured in Niagara falls down to your lightbulb. And that's what we do using electricity, that's right. Uh, Yeah, it's pretty simple. Actually, it seems complicated, but it's not. No, just electrons moving around. Yeah, let's talk about electrons, man, let's talk about the atom. We should we talk about the history of this stuff. Yes, let's uh. Back in the olden days, in ancient times, there were dudes messing around with with energy and static electricity without even knowing what they were doing. Right, they didn't understand it, But that doesn't mean that they weren't playing around with it. No, and getting zapped because they're messing mestatic electricity, that's right, which will explain all that later too. But there was one dude called Dallas of Melitas. He used a philosopher in Greece and in six d BC. He has thought to have been the first dude to mess around with electro statics static electricity by rubbing amber with fur and he noticed that dust and feathers and things were attracted to it. He didn't know what the heck was going on, but he knew something was up right, and the amber plays a pretty big role. It's actually um amber. The Latin er I'm sorry that Greek Greek Greek word for amber is um electron with a K. That was like the way heavy metal, you know, but that's so like our Our word electricity is derived from the Greek word for amber, from that first experiment with static electricity. Yeah, and it was actually coined by dude name William Gilbert. He was an Englishman, a physician, and he was studying sort of the same things with static electricity. The melitas was and he was the first person to say it's electric and he saw these forces at work with an exclamation point in his finger in the air. Yeah, and we should probably we should probably differentiate like statically. There's a couple of types of electricity. There's static electricity and then there's current electricity, right, and current electricity is what we are able to generate artificially. Static electricity exists in nature just naturally, and that was the first experiments carried out. Then there's other types of current electricity, like lightning. But at this time when these people are messing with electric or static electricity or um saying it's electric for the first time, the concept of electricity was that it was fluid. Well, it was fluid. He was on the right track, and something is flowing. But they thought it was literally a fluid which they called which in those days was called a humor. And he said it leaves what he called then, and uh, a flu the vm fluvium which is atmosphere around it. When you create this rubbing action, it removes that fluid. But it wasn't fluid. They were not dummies back then, but they were just figuring it all out. They weren't dummies because even Ben Franklin thought it was a fluid. It was the prevailing idea concept of electricity. UM and Ben Franklin and a couple of his contemporaries, including a guy named Thomas Francois Dollabard, Um, we're studying electricity big time. And it was when they really investigated lightning that are understanding of current electricity started to take shape. Yeah, the old story of Ben Franklin flying his kite may or may not have happened. There are some people that think that didn't happen. Now, But if if he didn't do it, other people did. There were there were guys who died carrying out that experiment. Yeah, but was definitely carried out. I don't know if Ben Franklin did or not. Yeah, that's that's sort of the story that he flew the kite with the key, and some people think it either didn't go down like that or didn't go down with him at all. But it's a great story either way. Yeah, and I think he at least proposed it that the experiment. Well, yeah, and he was the first guy to say that electricity has a positive and negative charge and that it flows from positive to negative. He's a smart guy, very smart. He's then there was another smart dude named Coulomb, Charles Augustine de Coulomb, and he is the one that wrote Coulomb's law, and he said charges light charges were l opposite charges attract and that's kind of like the basis for it all. Yeah, and the force of these charges is proportional to the to their product. So if you multiply the charges, they are going to be very strong or cancel one another out or push one another away. Yeah. He basically said, you can now calculate this because of my handy dandy little law. Yeah, and with a boom, he said boom, not bang. Okay, that came earlier. Later on, a guy named J. J. Thompson said at a science conference, Hey, I found something smaller than the atom. And everyone said, silly man, adams are invisible. You can't it even means invisible, you liar, And he said, no, I promise it's there's something smaller. It's got a negative charge, and I'm gonna call it a corpuscle. No he didn't. Yeah, it's Latin for small bodies. And then I think, I don't know who later said let's change it to electron. Yeah, it sounds way cooler. But the discovery of the electron was basically the birth of what we know as electricity today. The understanding of the electron is what it's all about. And would you say, like so before that time, I guess he didn't understand the electron, but he understood electricity. A guy named Michael Faraday was working on the case. Yeah, basically everybody's like Ben Franklin electricity hand in hand. Really, it's Michael Faraday, who's British um who really came to lay the foundation for electrifying the world. He just he created the first dynamo, which is a generator UM which we'll talk about he um first electric motor. Yeah, he just he got electricity and he explained it to other people very well. Can you even fathom how smart these people were to be that in the dark and figuring all this sub tomic stuff out back then? Hats off, top, Hats off to these guys, last chance garage at off and back on. Like I I have trouble understanding it now when it's explained through like Kids for Science website. You know, I'm not inventing this figuring this stuff out with the first time exactly. And it's a pretty dangerous field to try to figure out blind to you know. Yeah, I mean more than one scientist got a shock from a laden jar. Oh yeah, and you can make those? You do you make those in science class? Yeah? You can make well, it's it's we should say a laden jar is a very primitive capacitor. Use a metal rod in a jar and nail that's sunk into like some water, and it can store a charge. And I think Ben Franklin's kite experiment attached the kite to or a rod or something to a laden jar to store the charge too, if that happened, right, But again, he did make the proposal, it's whether or not he carried it out. Is it all right? I guess Now we can get the atoms finally. At Ms are very tiny and they make up molecules, and molecules make up everything you see. Yeah, atoms are the building block of matter, um and and atom. Remember we're always talking about nature loves homeostasis, does it? Um, you've got a balance that nature always seeks tries to achieve it. Same with atoms or atoms are no exception. I should say within an atom, you have nucleus which is made up of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles, neutrons are neutral. And then orbiting that nucleus making the cool atom symbol are electrons and they're negatively charged. And when you have an equal number of protons two electrons, you have a neutral atom. There's no potential energy there. It's just in balance. And uh, a lot of stuf off is like that. A lot of stuff isn't balanced, some stuff is not well. Some stuff falls out of balance easier than other stuff. Well. Yeah, the electrons sometimes they're super tightly bound to the atom and they don't want to leave the house and they want to stick around. Sometimes they're they're crazy teenagers and the slightest energy and movement makes them jump off from the atom and just say I want to go attach myself to something else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, And it depends on the material. And those types of material that have either tightly connected or loosely connected atoms either um end up conducting electricity very well or don't conduct electricity very well, so they act as either electrical conductors or electrical insulators. Yeah. Like if you pick up a stick off the ground, it's electrons like stay close to home, so it's not gonna conduct electricity. If you pick up a metal rod, as electrons are crazy loose and they like to go off and do those things that teenage electrons do, and therefore it does collect conduct electricity right very well under normal circumstances. When you pick up that rod, or you pick up that stick. The electrons are staying put no matter what. But we figured out along the way, thanks to the work of all of the people, from the Greeks to Faraday, to Ben Franklin to your guy with the core puscle idea. Um J J. Was his name, j J J J. Corp puscle. I think it was Thompson. So thanks to the work of all of these people, we figured out how to knock electrons loose. And it's ingenious and simple, but it's also very complex, and it involves the relationship between magnetism and electricity, and we'll talk about that right after this message. So Chuck, Yes, we're talking about knocking electronsluice, which is ultimately the basis of producing electricity. Yeah, like when you were a kid in elementary school, you probably did a little balloon trick where you make static electricity and make the balloon stick to your sweater. All you're doing, you're rubbing that balloon on your sweater, and electrons are jumping from that balloon onto your sweater. And now there are two different charges going on. Because you're overcharged, the balloon is now under charged, and because opposite charges attract it sticks to your sweater, right, And that's static electricity, and static you know, you have static and dynamic, and dynamic indicates motion. Static indicates staying still um and they use that to describe this type of electricity because the electrons don't flow, they just sit there and wait for a connection. Like when you touch something that's charged, like a door knob after you've shuffled with your feet in socks over carpet. When you touch that door knob, you're forming that connection, and all of a sudden, the balance is achieved once more, and the electrons flow like you're literally a conductor of electricity in that moment. Right, So with current electricity, those electrons move, they move along a conductive material, say like copper y or something like that. That's a hot one. Right. So let's talk about how you produce an electrical current, right, Okay, but let's talk about generators and turbines and all that awesome stuff. It sounds like you need to generate that electricity what they generate toor right, I think that's what generators are called. That why they're called that. Yeah, it's funny just how basic some of these things are. Like you say, a compute our right, But but you just you've heard it so many times you take it for granted it loses its meeting. It's like looking at a word too frequently. Yeah, I think I think a lot of these words are like that, like a generator, or a core pustle, or a what's it called when he stopped on the electricity, which we'll get to trans former? It transforms something. But you say them so much, you're like, what's the transformer? Do you know? Anyway? I've been reading too much science for dummy something. Alright, So generators, Um, well, I guess it all comes down to magnetism. Yes, in the case of generators. And if you want to listen to two shows Lightning and Magnetism before this one, it might help you understand electricity a little bit more, right, So just go listen to those. Do that right now two hours. So, Um, what what I think fair Day figured out was that because of this relationship between um, a magnet and electricity, you can take a magnet and you can move electrons in a say, conductive material. You can knock the electrons loose basically using a magnet. Yeah, it's like what happens when you attract a paper clip to a magnet. It's just the transfer of electrons jumping around. And you create a flow by flipping the polarity. And you can do this by rotating metal right, say, like a coiled copper within the two poles of a large magnet. And when you do this, you're reversing polarity all of a sudden, and you are knocking the electrons loose in those coils. Um. And the way that you spin the coils very quickly is by hooking the coils to say a shaft. We kind of did this backwards. Let's start at the beginning you want to, Okay, let's go to Niagara Falls. Okay, back in eighteen George Westinghouse, who is Nicola Tesla's boss, Which, by the way, if you want to listen to another really good podcast, um, go listen to that one, Nicola Tesla one. Remember it was all about the A C. D C War between Tesla and Edison episode animals. Yeah, it's pretty awful, jerk um. But in eight George Westinghouse set up a hydroelectric power plant along the Niagara Falls. And what he did was he had a means of taking the movement of water, which is kinetic energy. The water at the top of the falls has potential energy, and then once it falls over, that potential turns to kinetic energy. Well, Westinghouse set up a turbine to catch this movement of water, right, which is actual energy, and have that movement spin a turbine, a propeller, a fan. Yeah, it's the same concept as an old gristmill, except it's not creating energy. It's just moving the stones that grind the wheat or corn, right the gristmill is in this case it's it's capturing that energy by or it's transferring it, we should say, by converting that kinetic energy from the water into mechanical energy spinning the the turbine. The turbine is connected to that shaft I was talking about where we say, and they changed course. And at the end of that shaft, which is now spinning thanks to the turbine, thanks to the movement of the water, is some coiled copper and that coiled copper is spinning within those two magnets. That's the key, right, And because of that the electrons are being knocked loose. You have a power line leading from the coiled copper out and all of a sudden, you have an electric current. Yeah. And um, if you've ever been to the Hoover Dam or something, you don't have to have a waterfall or a river to make this thing work, if you That's why they build dams. You stop up the water and then at the base of the dam you have the means to release that water and then it becomes that flowing water. Right. And then also for thermal power plants, they use nuclear power to create a nuclear reaction to produce heat, or they burn coal to produce heat, and then they use that heat the heat water, and then they use that water to create steam, and then that steam turns a turbine. And these are all just different methods, whether it's solar or steam or new nuclear. Almost said it, which is weird because I definitely don't say it that way. Well, you you're very excited. I think I said enough as a joke, right that it slips in. But anyway, all those are just means to turn that turbine, right, And all it is is you're using that stored energy or that kinetic energy like over here to create electricity so that you can transfer it into work down the line. That's right. It's so cool. Yeah, And this article. We used a few different articles for this one, like we said, including some science for kids websites, which by the way, I highly recommend if you don't get something. Yeah, it's a great place to go visit or these kids websites because they break it down like super simply because kids are dumb. But in our article, it uh, it describes a generator UM as if it was a water and a pump, which made a lot of sense to me. UM. The generator is the pump, but instead of pushing water through a pipe, it's pushing electrons down a line power line, and that whole like using water as an analogy UM for electricity fits very well. Yeah, but you need something to push it. It's not it's not a self pusher, so you need that force, and that force is voltage. Yeah, it's electromotive force. It's the same with water, like UM, you have water pressure that forces the water down the line, right, And with electricity you have a force that moves electricity and its voltage, like you said, measured in volts, and the electrical current UM is measured in amps, and the amps represent the total number of electrons flowing through any one point of a circuit in any every second, and there's a lot of them. And if you have voltage and you add that to current, which is amps, you get power, which is what's right, And I think it's multiplied by it. Oh really, yeah it is. Okay, I wasn't even thinking of it as a math formula, but it is. It is a math formula. And the reason why it's a math formula is because they're related. Like you can flip flop them, you can adjust them. Um. And that's the whole basis of industrial power transmission, that which will get to later. Yeah, And I know it sounds a little confusing with the volts, amps and watts, but they are all different. Like if you said, you know that guy was shocked and he had a hundred and twenty volts uh coursing through his body, that's not true at all, um, because the vault is the force and he's got he's got amps coursing through his body. But you'd be a huge geek to point it out to someone. Someone said that, And a good rule of them is the higher the vaults, the more dangerous the shock, which is why in America, UM most outlets and homes are two are a hundred and twenty volt where if you touch it, you're gonna feel it, but it's probably not going to kill you. In the United States is one twenty, But it's different in other countries, right, which is why like European appliance can be plugged into an American appliance because you got to get those adapters. Yeah. So, UM, you were talking about current, which is the number of electron flowing through a circuit. You have UM the volts, which is the force or pressure that's pushing them down the line, and then you have UM those two multiplied by one another to create watts, which is power. You also there's one there's another um factor to electrical currents UM, and that is resistance. Oh yeah, we didn't talk about that, so we acted like it was all either an insulator or conductor. But you can be a resistor. Well, I mean everything, everything has a certain level of resistance. Yeah, but if you're an official resistor, that means current moves, it just doesn't move like as fast as it might in metal, or not at all in wood. Yeah, or glass is another good resistor insulator UM, and so so so is rubber. But even something is like conductive is copper wire has a certain amount of resistance. And again that water flowing analogy comes into place like if you pump like some water really really hard to try to get a lot of water through a very small pipe, it's still not going to come out very high, very fast because you're trying to force too much water through that that little pipe. So in the exact same way a thin wire where you're trying to push a lot of amps through and a lot of bolts through, Uh, it's going to resist. And when you when you have resistance in an electrical circuit, you have UM what you lose some of those electrons that are flowing in the form of heat, which is produced by electrons bumping up against other atoms that aren't sharing their their electrons UM. And that's the result of friction and resistance is measured in Ohm's h M. Should we talk about circuits, Yeah, we were there. I think so all this is well and good. That's uh. You know, you can supply power and we'll talk about this more in detail to two homes from a power plant, UM. But you can also have a little battery supplying that electrical energy to a iPhone, let's say. And in that case, you need something called a circuit, which is basically just a closed loop that allows the electrons to travel. And in most electronics it's like like you said, like copper wire maybe, and it travels from you know, there's a switch that turns it on and off um, which is why a circuit is called a circuit breaker. Like if you break that circuit by turning and switch off, or if the wire like snaps or something, it's gonna no more electrons are gonna be flowing, right, because there's the and the reason they're not gonna be flowing any longer is because the positive pole and the negative poll from that circuit are no longer connected. Another way to look at voltage is that it is the difference between uh electrons on one side and electrons on another side of a circuit. And remember we talked about nature always wanting balance. Electrons flow from negative to positive rights, and as they flow, the reason they're flowing. The whole reason they're moving at all is because there are not as many electrons on the positive side as there are on the negative side, so they want to leave the negative side to go achieve balance on the positive side and ultimately make whatever circuit it's traveling neutral. You stick something in that circuit and as as electrons are moving from the negative side to the positive side. Because again electricity is just the flow of electrons, you can convert that movement into productive work. Yeah, mechanical energy, right, And anything you attach onto a circuit to exploit that flow of electrons for work is called the load. Yeah. It could be a lightbulb or you know whatever. Whatever mechanical energy you're trying to create is your load. And there's all sorts of things you can do by attaching a load to a circuit, like a light bulb. UM. A light bulb basically uses uh that electricity flow to um flow into a resistant filament very thin wire that purposely resists that flow of electricity, generating heat and then turn heating up to produce light. That's how a light bulb works. You can also recharge batteries, which go in and force electrons back into the negative position so that the batteries recharge and those electrons are ready to flow again once you connect the circuit. UM. There is also appliances that use resistors to produce heat, like a hair dryer or a toaster. There's all sorts of stuff you you can do to connect into the circuit, but it's all the same whether it's a battery or a toaster or a whole house, if you want to look at it that way, it's you're plugging a load onto an electrical circuit and exploiting the flow of electrons. Yeah, and I kind of misspoke a minute ago when I said it's creating the mechanical energy. You need a motor to actually do that. So if you have an electric drill, that's great that you have electrons flowing, but it's not going to turn anything unless you have that motor. And electric motor is basically just a cylinder, uh, stuffed with magnets around the edge. And if you've ever used an electric drill and you fire it up, when you look and seeing the vents, you can actually see sparks. It's pretty cool. It's very cool. It's like those little guns you used to get at the circus when you're yeah, god, I love those. Um. So it's packed with those magnets around the edge, and in the middle you've got your core, which is, you know, like an iron wire and uh, it's wrapped around you know, the coppers wrapped around the edges. So electricity flows to that core, creates magnetism, and then that pushes against the outer cylinder and makes that motor spin around. And then that's where you get your mechanical energy, right, and uh, an electric motor is probably the best example of how you're converting um energy from one form to another and then reconverting it because an electric motor is basically a generator in reverse. Yeah, And so you use that mechanical energy the spinning of the turbine down the line, and convert it in your electric drill back into mechanical energy to spin spin the drill. And in between is that flow of electrons that's causing the whole thing, or that's carrying that energy from point A to point b core puscles. There's one other there's one other thing. Um if you look at a plug that you're plugging an appliance into, because again you're just attaching a load to that flow of electrons and diverting it through your appliance and then it goes back on its merry way. Right. If you look at a plug, sometimes you'll see three prongs and the third prong, the one on the bottom seems different from the other ones. It's round, and that is actually a grounding wire. Very important, very very important, because as awesome as we've gotten with producing and directing electricity, we can't control the amount of electrons that flow through an outlet to down to a single electron, and so there's such a thing as leakage of electrons, which is crazy. And there's also um electrical build up that can happen where if you're not using all of the um amps in through an appliance, the residual amps can build up and they charge the appliance and again, as with static electricity, charges just sitting there waiting to be neutralized, sometimes through you, which can make it very dangerous. To prevent this, they have they connect the appliance through either that third prong in a plug or through an actual grounding wire to a copper wire that's driven into the ground. And that's where the word comes from ground. You're actually transferring that residual um electric electric energy to the ground, which is basically an infinite reservoir for charge of dispersal to earth. Yeah, So like when you look at a power line and you see that bare wire coming down from the parallel line and driven into the ground by a steak that is the ground, and it goes down like six or ten feet. Or if you look at every house, you're gonna see near the meter, the electrical meter, you're gonna see a probably a copper rod driven into the ground, and that's your house is ground. Exactly the same thing with a lightning rod. It's a ground for your entire house, so that the lightning doesn't go through your how as it goes through the lightning rod. And the point of all of those is that the earth is it can take it. Go ahead and give it as many electrical shocks as you want. It's gonna be fine, so we think. And it's a very good it's very good at just dispersing those charges. So that's what grounding comes from. Very important stuff. Yeah, and uh, we mentioned transformers earlier. Um power plants create massive amounts of electricity and you can't just shoot that down a power line and straight into a house because it will blow up everything in your in your home immediately. But they do need that kind of juice in order to transfer like hundreds of miles away from the power plant. You know, if you don't live close, it's still got to get to you. So the way they do that as new transformers, they transmit the power with a lot of voltage, so more force, less amperage, less resistance, less resistance, which means you lose less. And then once it you know, they stop it down along the way and by the time it gets your home, it's transformed down to here in the United States and twenty volts more elsewhere. Nights nice and safe, right, And then you just plug your appliance into it and all of a sudden that electrical energy transmits to your coaster. Strudal being warmed, your hot pocket with tainted meats. That yeah, remember that whole horsemade thing with Ikea the last couple of years. It wasn't just Ikea, but they were definitely called out, maybe most strongly for I think the hot pockets too. They called it unsound meat, which is just a word that sounds weird in front of meat. Unsound is not you don't want to go near it, unsound, unclean, It's biblical, all right. So now I think we even though we've covered it in the Tesla podcast, we do need to go over a C D C a little bit like go listen to that podcast. That's a great one. Best Australian band of all time. They were good. Yeah, yeah, are good, David? Are they still around? Yeah? Man, David Bowie played a pretty mean Tesla. No, I'm not telling my Teslam on my A C d C okay. Uh was all right? And they're not around. That's how I was really confused. I was more confused about that than I was by any aspect of electricity. I'm like, yeah, man, of course they're around anyone in the Australian Uh yeah, No, A C DC is great and they're still around. Huh yeah there. I think you're putting an album together right now. Given for them, I'll bet it sounds exactly like all the rest. It's still rocks blues based rock. Uh in valure velvet. Yes. So there was a battle being waged between Tesla and Edison, and Tesla was all about the A C current alternating current. Edison, as we know, said no, no, no, that's far too dangerous and I'll prove this to you by electrocuting animals and dogs and cats and even an elephant named topsy and Um. And he was alleged to have helped botch the first electrocution by electric chair by a state Oh yeah, um. I don't remember the details of that, but it's definitely in our our episode on Exploded the guy. Yeah, he was a real jerk, remember, um. And I think we remember I remember talking about there should be a movie too about that that battle. Yeah. I can't believe there's not. It sounds super nerdy, but it would actually be interesting to go over. Well these things degreed. So batteries these days use direct current power DC power, and that means the positive and negative terminals are always positive and negative, and it always electricity always flows in the same direction from negative depositives. It does not alternate. Yeah, just think about it this way. Uh, negative and electrons negative. So in any terminal, that's where all the negative charges vibes, and then positive is where the electrons want to be because they're seeking to balance it out and create neutral so that there's no pole good vibes, yeah, or the very least so so vibes, but not negative no. Um. And then you have alternating current or a C, which means the current reverses sixty times per second here in the US fifty times per second. In Europe, So it's just reversing back and forth, alternating that current. And uh, I guess, so who went out in the end Tesla um on a large scale. Well, yeah, I mean that's does Edison has his batteries. I guess he could throw it up, which are pretty important too. But yeah, I think we kind of came out in the same way on that episode. They both kind of won. Yeah, but Tesla was the cooler dude. Although Tesla died penniless in New York in the nineteen forties and Edison died of rich fat guy, he died of consumption and gout. No has been Franklin. I guess we can finish with um. If you get your power bill and you're amazed and you wonder how they calculate this stuff, it's pretty easy. Like we said here in the US, we deliver electricity into your home at a hundred and twenty volts, So you gotta remember that one too. It's important. Our article uses a space heater as an example, which I think is pretty good. You plug in that space heater. Let's say it's the only thing going in your house, which is not realistic, but go with me. You plug in the space heater and it comes out to ten amps. So you multiply that ten times undred and twenty because that's your voltage, and you have got twelve hundred watts of heat or one point to kill a watts. Yes, because that's how the power company is going to measure it, because they deal in big chunks. And if you leave that heater on for an hour, you just used one point to kill a watt hours, which is how you're build. Yeah, and if they charge you a dime per kilo hot hour, it's gonna cost you twelve cents an hour to run that space heater. Right, Pretty simple and neat. And that's why when you go to buy an appliance you should look at that little tag that says how many kill a wat hours you're gonna be burning? That's right, The lower the better. So electricity, Huh, you got anything else? No, don't play around with it, No, don't. Uh. Yes. I always wear rubber sold shoes because rubber is an insulator. It is why because it hangs on to its electrons, the atoms that make up rubber. It's just that simple. Uh. If you want to know more about electricity, you can type that word in the search part how stuff works dot Com. You can also go on all sorts of kids science sites and find out more about it too. And since I said search bar, it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this rare birthday shout out. Hey, guys, my name is Pearl, and I just want to tell you how much a fan I am of your show. I was introduced to the podcast by my best friend Molly. We've been best friends for twelve years, and many of our conversations begin by commenting on the podcast. For example, we could not stop laughing at your nineteen twenties voice. Towards the end the Underground Tunnels episode, we laughed over and over that I think she's talking about this one see Electricity, Tesla Edison killing animals. All right, that was for you, Molly and Pearl. Whenever we're in the car together, we find a podcast of yours to listen to so we can enjoy it together. I was wondering if you could help her out. Molly's twenty six birthday is April ninth, and I think it would be totally awesome birthday gift if you would send her a shout out during listener mail I would be forever in your debt. Thanks for doing the podcast. I'm a middle school teacher who always listens during my prep periods and so happy birthday, Molly, Happy twenty six. That should be close. Yeah, happy birthday to April Night. That was very nice of us, and thank you Pearl Webb in Chicago. And your friendship means a lot to us. Yeah, you know, your friendship with one another. Yeah, and then conversely through us all together in their car. Yeah. Well, if you want to get some sort of shout out sometimes Chuck uh Danes too, he's very nice. Um.
