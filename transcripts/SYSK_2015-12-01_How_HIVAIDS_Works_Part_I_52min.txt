Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know friend House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W Chuck Bryant, and uh, this is stuff you should know the podcast. That's right, treating sir. Two part podcast. Yeah, today release day, not the day we're recording. We're not that good. But today's December one, it is World Aids Day. And we were going to record this a while ago, and then I noticed it was World Aids Day coming up. I was like, well, why don't we wait and record it later and release it then? And then there was so much stuff right that it became clear it was a two parter. And I still don't think we're gonna even well, we'll scratch the surface. That's selling it short. But you can have an entire podcast series about HIV and AIDS, for sure. There's so much information there, really is. It's like daunting, it is, but it's all luckily because it's such a huge, massive topic. Yeah, um, an important topic. There's a lot of information out there, so usually we do pretty well with those that'll be daunted, is what I'm trying to say. Well, I'm just nervous, you know, I don't want to mess this one up. We will mess something up here there, I guarantee it. But yeah, how about this, then we pledge. We often read corrections, but we super pledge to correct anything on this because we're bound to mess something up. It's just a lot of a lot of stuff. You want to start from the beginning. Dump be nervous. That's fine. Everybody tell Chuck, it'll be fine. It'll be fine, Chuck. So it's a collective sound of our audience, like high pitched audience voice. Um so chuck. When you think of HIV AIDS UM, you typically tend to like go back to the late seventies early eighties when like the real panic first started. UM. But it later research and that's about the time it arrived in the United States. But later research found that UM HIV, the first case of it came in ninety nine actually, and that they think that um, it goes back even earlier than that. But this is the first documented case. They had blood work of this guy who died mysteriously in conshasa and congo. Right, um and uh, he had the first documented case of HIV. That's right, HIV one. Uh. There are two hivs, HIV one, and HIV two. The one that has been responsible for the global pandemic is HIV one. And there's been a lot of debate over the years about where it actually came from. Uh. Most people agreed that it was primates in Africa, right, that it started as s I V. Yes, Uh, simeon, I mean no deficiency virus. HIV. We should say is human immunodeficiency virus. Yes, and AIDS is acquired immune deficiency syndrome. They're not separate things. It's actually been very much confused in the media. We're gonna set the record straight. Yeah, and uh at the end, boy, how about this for a tease. At the end of the second episode, there's a big musical number no three days from now. There is an argument that we should not even call it AIDS any longer. So how's that first set up? People are gonna be waiting where they could just google it fast forward. Well, but they can't fast forward in time, my friend. No, but find the time these come out, they'll have been done and they can fast forward. Yes, that's true. So what scientists believe, this is the most current agreed upon theory, is that a type of chimpanzee and West Africa is the source of HIV one uh, which was transmitted to humans. They don't know for sure how because probably are probably be bushed me, undercooked, pushed me exactly, you know, wanting to eat chimpanzee and there's blood, and all of a sudden it spreads to humans, and you tube, chimpanzees fight back, they do, That's what I've heard. Yeah. But yeah, if you ingest blood that was infected with s i V and then the SIV virus um evolved into HIV and humans, that's the likeliest version of what happened somewhere in West Africa, probably the thirties or forties. Yeah, and they I saw one article that said that they think that it could have originally started in primates even in the nineteen twenties, which is just crazy to think about, like the Roaring twenties, somewhere in the depths of Africa s i V was brewing, you know, because it seems like such a modern thing for sure. Uh. And then uh, in the late seventies and early eighties is when um, these normally healthy people in Los Angeles and New York started getting sick. Didn't make any sense. Uh. They first started using the term um AIDS right, and before that they had a really clumsy name for it, um O for HIV. Yeah. Are you ready? Yea, So just the abbreviation is clumsy ht l V three slash l a V. That's just the abbreviation. The full name of what was originally the term for um was it is it aids V for HIV human T cell lymphotropic virus type three slash lymphidano pathy associated virus. Yeah. And I think they all looked around the room whoever proposed that, and said, guys, if we want to ever get this in the news, let's just sweeten that and shorten it to HIV. You the person who proposed it, you have to go buy everyone quiz Nos for lunch. Uh. And actually we should say, chuck that this this definitely just kind of we're giving the farrest overview of this. But um there's a really really interesting movie based on what I understand is an equally interesting book called and the band played On. My brother worked on that movie. That was a great, great movie. I watched it again in the last few months and it's just as good as ever. Yeah, that's where he got to work with Ellen Aldnei, Tomlin and like some real legends. So yeah, there's a lot of people in it. Phil Collins does a great job. Yeah, he plays a bath house owner who's reluctant to close down. Interesting. Um, but it's it basically chronicles the early investigation into what the heck was going on. What was suddenly killing gay men in San Francisco and Los Angeles and New York. And it seemed like it was just targeting gay men so much so that early on, like the the non clinical term for this was gay cancer is what people called it. And all of a sudden, doctors were reporting that otherwise healthy men were suddenly getting really really rare cancers, rare types of ammonia, stuff that people who have like zero immune systems die from. All of a sudden, they were just turning up with this stuff, and um, it was very curious and very scary, especially in the gay community. And then um, it wasn't until what was eighty three three where they identified the virus and there was a there were competing teams, this French team who most likely did discover the HIV virus on their own, and Alan Alda, the American team who may or may not have ripped off their findings and unfairly taken credit for it. But and I've never seen that movie. Fascinating. It's fascinating, it's moving, it's got it all. It's really good. It's good. It's like um uh, epidemiological detective stories threaded throughout a lot of cultural history. It's really really worth watching. Well in uh. In episode two, we're also going to get to that book in the so called patient zero um, which will be coming up on Thursday. Another tease. Alright, so um, and we should point out to the reason these men were dying of cancers and pneumonia and things like that is because and most people know this by now. A lot of this we think is just common knowledge, but you never know. You're you don't die of AIDS. You die of complications from AIDS, infections, other sicknesses and diseases because you can't mount any kind of immune response. Okay, I think that was a good move. Yeah, well, smooth move, excellence. You never know, Like some of this stuff, I'm like, dude, really have to say this stuff, but you do well. The weird thing is you do, especially in is compared to say, like because Um, there's become this idea that AIDS has been as being largely conquered, it doesn't have to be worried about as much and not true. I think the education on HIV and AIDS is not nearly as widespread as it once was. Like when we were like teenagers, you know, like everybody knew everything about AIDS basically at least had a working knowledge of what AIDS was, how you got it, how widespread it was. And UM, it seems like today it's that that kind of public information. Is it nearly is widespread? Yeah, I think that's one of the issues now, is that, Um, a large segment of the public is like, yeah, they have the AIDS cocktail. Look at Magic Johnson. It's all great, sure, And um it is great when we're gonna talk about why he's still with us, but it's it's still a very big problem. Um. Here's a here's a stat for you. Uh. And these are the most recent stats I could find. Seventy eight million HIV infected people worldwide to date, thirty nine million people dead. Um. Compared to World War Two, which killed forty million people. That helps put it into perspective a little bit. Uh. And sub Saharan South Africa, which is where AIDS is an HIV or most threatening. Um, this is a scary status, dude. One and twenty people have HIV what in sub Saharan South Africa and the account for seventy of all cases worldwide of HIV man a lie, I know. It's it's a very dire situation over there, to say the least. Uh, Well, that's that's that's especially chilling because if you look at the statistics in the United States, like it's it's slowing and it's it's definitely if you look at the statistics, it seems like it's being figured out. Well, yeah, it depends on what demographic though it's rising in some demos, right, Yeah, for sure. If you take the United States as a whole, the picture seems okay. But yeah, if you start to break it down into specific subgroups, then some are definitely doing better than others. As far as new infections, death from infections, that kind of stuff come absolutely. Uh So, HIV is a scary disease and it was super scary before we knew much about it because, um, it's still technically incurable. Although we're going to get to that. There are some rare cases where it's what do they call it, functionally cured? Yes, Um, it does seem like there's at least one person who is widely considered to be fully cured, and he is a proof of concept that you can cure AIDS, and that's coming in part two. What are we going to do in part one? We're just yeah, like we're just talking. Basically, this is all one big setup for part two. Apparently, No, it's not. So. One reason AIDS and so deadly is uh, it's sort of a conundrum because AIDS you can't catch it through the air. It's not airborne. You can't catch it from a kitchen counter. You can only catch it through very specific ways intimate contact, intimate context. You would think, hey, it's not gonna be that widespread because intimate contact is something you can avoid and so it should be a pretty slow spreading disease, right, and not all intimate contact includes like whips and chains and stuff like that. Intimate contact is basically any situation where um, you know sure, Uh. Intimate contact is basically any situation where blood is transferred or semen is transferred. Um, So it doesn't necessarily just mean intercourse of any sort. It can also mean sharing needles, and it definitely does mean sharing needles too. That's a very high risk UM subgroup for sure. But the reason, and here's the key, that AIDS has spread an HIV um so widely and quickly is because it can You can have HIV for more than ten years without knowing it. And if you are a promiscuous individual. I did a little math. Let's say you have let's say you're considered highly promiscuous. What what what do you rate that as hundred partners a year, which apparently also so. I want to say this to UM, but AIDS being associated with gay people, gay man especially UM is it hit at precisely the worst possible time in the history of homosexuality in the world because it came right after, right after Stonewall, when men were just starting to be like, it's all about gay pride and we are love and life and having more sex than we've ever had ever as a community, and having a hundred or a couple hundred sexual partners in the late seventies among gay men was pretty standard. Yeah, I don't know it definitely. I don't think it made you an outlier, you know, continue so and a caveat all this with I'm assuming, Well, let me just get into it. Let's say a hundred partners in a year. Let's say of those partners are promiscuous. Man, this is so, then they have a mathematic. Then they have a hundred partners. So that's people. And and this is not people who are infected. This is assuming. Let's say that there's a smaller percentage that don't use condoms. And even if you don't use a condom, it's not like every time you have sex you're going to transmit aids um. But this is a possibility, is what I'm saying. Let's say that group are promiscuous. You end up from that one single person people who could possibly potentially be exposed if nobody wore condoms at all. And of course that number goes way down because people are smarter now and use condoms. But in the late seventies, I mean that number could be accurate, you know, oh yeah easily. So I mean, what are you gonna wear a condom back then? For nobody's getting pregnant, you know, yeah, I mean there was no reason to. Uh, so you can see how can spread so quickly, and that is also the reason why it stays latent, or the reason the fact that it stays latent for so long, that's the single reason why you need to get tested. Yeah, regularly, gay, straight, black, brown, candy striped. It doesn't matter, get tested because you may have it and not know it. And HIV eighth is an outlier as far as diseases go, in that there's no there's no vaccine against it, um, there is no way to easily treat it. It spreads quickly, and because it has what's called late onset symptoms, like you said, people go ten years after being infected before they realize they're sick, especially if they're not getting tested in the meantime. And so it just keeps spreading and spreading and spreading among people who think they're healthy but who actually have the virus. Yeah, and if you're promiscuous, it's not like you can name the partners you've had over the last decade to tell them maybe you want to get tested, you know. And then even more than that, and again, well, so with the gay community, it's such an at risk UM subgroup. We'll explain why in a second, but one of the reasons why it spreads quickly in the gay community because it's a relatively small community. So that means that the pool you have to draw from for sexual partners, statistically speaking, you're at higher risk. Yeah, because it's smaller, because it is a smaller community. But even beyond that, biologically speaking, they're at higher risk as well. Gay men are. Yeah, well we should just go ahead talk about that. The main reason is it's easier to get HIV from anal sex and that is men and women because um, the well, there's a few reasons for that. One, the lining of the rectum is very fragile, it tears very easily. UM, and intercourse lots of blood vessels, lots of blood vessels. Um. The cells that line the rectum are more susceptible to HIV than cells of the vagina. Right and then uh semen and rectal mucosa, which is the lining of the rectum, carry more HIV than vaginal fluid. So boom, right there, you're I think eighteen percent eighteen eighteen times more risky with anal intercourse than just regular vaginal inter course. Right, and saying that right, you are, yes, and um, gay men and straight women are equal risk of AIDS through um through unprotected sex anally, because it doesn't it doesn't matter that you're a man or not. No, a man's rectum is the same as a woman's right exactly as far as I know. I'm pretty sure you're right about that. Yeah, I mean it says in here, uh the risk. Yeah, that's exactly right. Another reason is a role versatility is what they call it. Whether or not you're a top or a bottom, you can get it either way by giving anal sex or receiving anal sex. So you're kind of in a lose lose situation precisely. Uh. So that and I never knew that until I've studied this, that switching, like why why do gay men get a HIV more than uh, straight people if it's passed through intercourse? And now it all makes sense, all right? Going back to why AIDS is so scary and HIV, I feel like we're interchanging those and we shouldn't be. No, let's let's lay this out right here right now, you're ready, because I didn't realize this fully until we started researching this episode. So HIV is a it's called the progressive disease in that it goes through stages. So technically UM and HIV infection has zero stage zero to stage three UH and all of this is based on the number of T helper cells you have in a milli leader of blood. Normal healthy person has about a million T helper cells called CD plus four cells in one milli leader of their blood. As you um, as the the HIV infection progresses, it diminishes the number of these helper cells. And as it goes down you go to certain stages, so like stage three HIV is um I think five hundred thousand per milli leader or blood or less. And then once you reach two hundred thousand uh c D plus four cells in your blood UH, you have AIDS. So AIDS is not a separate disease. It's not a it's not a new condition that that arises out of HIV. It's all it's just part of a classification system. Yeah, it's basically ND stage HIV. It's stage four HIV, and it's really bizarre that they have a whole different name for it if you think about it. But a this is just basically the end category of HIV. And it used to be that was a death sentence. Once you had AIDS, you were basically dead. And in the eighties and nineties, especially before I think the AIDS cocktail, which we'll talk about came out, it was, um, you basically were diagnosed and you were dead in twelve to eighteen months. That was that. Now it can keep going you, I mean, people just live for decades now with AIDS. But once you have AIDS, once you have that designation, UM, you have that for the rest of your life, unless you're cured, which has only happened a handful of times. Yeah, and there's a guy named Todd Heywood that wrote this great article uh saying it's time to retire the medical category of AIDS, and he makes a lot of good reasons why we should just call it HIV disease like you would say heart disease. Right, So we're not gonna say HIV disease in this show. We're not that big as friends. Well, I just wanna go with traditional terms because some people learn. But I think there is a good case to be made for that is what I'm saying. I mean, this is also another UM. Another mark in that guy's in favor of that argument is that AIDS was named in and we've learned so much about this disease since then, and one of the things we've learned is this is a progressive disease that goes through stages. AIDS is just the end stage of it. Why have a different name for it? And there's no, it's not the same in any two people. Uh, And HIV disease is just more all encompassing. I think, yeah, so we're not going to use it, are we. That's gonna be tough. What to not say HIV disease? Oh, AIDS, I thought you were saying yeah. Uh. And the final reason, boy, this took like twenty minutes to get back to us. Wait what are we talking about? The final reason that HIV is uh super scary is because of its very unique way it manifests itself, which is um it invades and destroys the immune system. The very system that is supposed to protect you from disease is ruined. It's yeah, it's HIV is a virus, so it behaves like a virus. But other viruses attacks, say like you're fat cell that you could care less about, So who cares? AIDS or HIV attacks your immune system directly. The cells, a specific type of cell of your immune system and that's what eventually leads to your death or used to definitely lead to your death. You know, I'm back in my day, all right. I think we should take a break and we will talk a little bit about how it is and is not transmitted right after this, all right, Josh, it's uh, George Orwell is in charge. I'm in elementary school, and AIDS is a scary thing, and you can get it from toilet seats and mosquitoes and kissing and shaking hands. Shaking hands, Yeah, being too near to somebody. It was very scary as far as times go to be a kid. None of that stuff is true. Think about it, man. We were raised during that horrible little ven diagram where the Cold War and the AID scare overlapped. Like we just basically didn't want to leave our houses. We missed out on the days where free secs and and drugs was like, didn't hurt anybody, and just sprinkle in a little stranger danger in there too, why not? Yeah, a little satanic panics sure. And the eighties what a crazy time now that you know we've got a little distance from it. Parachute pants is that all about culture? Club was actually great? That's the only good thing about the eighties. UM the ways that you can get HIV sexual contact, sharing needles interview in his needles, breastfeeding, mother to baby, UM infected mother to fetus during pregnancy, at birth, and blood transfusions, which used to happen a lot and doesn't happen that much anymore. No, and there was It's another thing for me in the band played on, was this big to do about whether or not UM Blood Donation Center say like the Red Cross should have to test blood for this new disease. They were like, do you know how much this is gonna cost. It's gonna completely dent the blood supply. People are gonna die because we have to do this. But then as it became very obvious that you this stuff spread really easily through blood transfusions, they definitely started to check it. They came up with a I think a fairly cheap test for it in UM. Yeah, the FDA approved something in to test it. But I mean without these tests suck. You have a nine thousand, two hundred and fifty chants out of ten thousand of of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion. That's yeah, man, Yeah, that those are pretty high chances because think about it, and for unprotected anal sex, if you are receiving, you have a hundred and thirty eight out of ten thousand chance. Okay, this is nine thousand, two hundred and fifty out of ten thousand chants from a blood transfusion. I tried to find those stats. Actually I couldn't find that one. Oh I got some more for you, buddy, if you want them. Well, I was trying to find when I was doing my my stupid mathematical equation earlier, I was trying to find out the possibility or percentage rate of having unprotected anal sex, Like what are your chances of getting if you're if you're giving, you have an eleven out of ten thousand chance, so one point one out of every thousand encounters. So even if my yeah, that's sixty two, number goes way way down, thankfully, but I think it's still you know this is this is based on and I should say this is based on the distribution of HIV infected people across the United States as of like I think two thousand ten, so, um, I mean, it's all statistics, man, It depends on where you are, who you're hanging out with UM. I mean, if you're like sharing needles with with like UM addicts in the street, your risk is probably going to be a little higher than the national average across the United States, you know what I mean. So it definitely is contextual. It's almost to the point where it's like these these stats are meaningless, really, but they do put a I think stats help people put like a face to things. For sure. The blood transfusion one is a tad eye open for real um. And then finally we need to mention And the only reason we mentioned this is because technically it is possible. There has been one case of HIV infection through open mouth kissing. Yes, but I hesitate to even say that because people like Josh and Chokes said, you get through kissing, So you're there has to be bloody gums of an HIV infected person present. I think both people have to have bleeding gums and one of the people has to have HIV and they just make out and the the HIV is transferred that way. That clearly doesn't happen much. Apparently it happened at least once, which is pretty crazy. But yes, you're you're very it's extraordinarily unlikely that you're going to contract HIV through open mouth kissing. It does not transmit um. Well, here's the good news. This sounds like it's all bad news. The good news is it is not airborne, does not transfer through the surface contact. It's very fragile outside the body, super fragile, which is awesome. Like once saliva or blood dries up, there's practically zero chance of transmission. Um and yeah, it just it doesn't live very long outside the body, which it sounds bad, but it could be a lot worse. Oh yeah, you know, super hard through um breathing. Yeah, through the air, it would be bad. Uh. It is not transmitted through saliva, tears, or sweat. Uh. And saliva and tears have trace amounts of HIV. They have not detected HIV and sweat at all, which is good news for me because I'm a sweaty guys. Yeah, it's good news for us. I guess you're right, uh, insects. I guess we need to talk about the whole mosquito thing, because I think I talked about this in the virus episode. Um was it virus? There was something? Maybe I remember it might have been just the mosquitoes. One, Oh yeah, maybe so. I remember thinking when I was a kid like and this before I had read anything about it. I came up with it on my own. It's like, wow, mosquitoes, those are like little needles. I bet they could transmit AIDS or HIV, and um, it's not true. So here's why. There's very very good scientific reasons why you can't catch HIV from a mosquito. When a mosquito injects its probosis into your skin, um, it uses its own saliva to lubricate this, this whole thing right um. And and when it draws blood out, it can conceivably draw the HIV virus out of an HIV infected person through their blood. Right. But there's a couple of things that that um happened after that. One, the mosquito goes and digests its blood meal to the so it doesn't just immediately go to another person and pick up some more blood usually um to the virus does not replicate within the mosquito. Uh. And Three, that virus isn't present in the mosquito saliva. So even if it went and drank the blood of an HIV infected person got HIV in it and then went and and and injected you and got some of your blood and then went back and digestis blood meal. You still would not catch HIV from that. There would be no transfer of HIV from that person's blood into your body. Yeah. And they've even investigated in like parts of Africa where aids in HIV are rampant and where mosquitoes are rampant and transmit all kinds of diseases, and they've still said nope, nope, nope, not happening, thank god. Uh. And then of course toilet seats, swimming in a pool with someone eating at the same restaurant sharing a fork. Even social kissing closed mouth kissing. Did you know there was a name for that closed mouth kissing? Yeah? I call it no fun social kissing? What like the French you do? Like yeah? Or I call that wedding ceremony kissing. You don't often see people when they say you may kiss the bride just like go full to its gross. I think I saw one guy do that once at a wedding. I was like, oh, man, man, come on, do like a nice respectful kiss on the lips. You mean I went to a friend's wedding recently and um, they had a nice kiss Tony and Wenney. Congratulations. By the way, guys, what was nice about it? It was not social kissing, but it was not like you gross it was. It was a good wedding kiss, a good romantic, but tasteful kiss, perfectly perfectly put. Well, that's nice. I hate that. I miss that. Um do you maybe I can get my hands on video of it or they? Uh yeah, Virus Talk with Josh and Chuck by the way, October, Yeah, but I really think it was the Mosquito's episode that you talked about it. No, no no, no, I mean we're about to talk about virus is because HIV is a virus, agreed, And as you learned and Virus Talk, um, viruses require a host cell because viruses are basically they're not their own thing, like they they just are carrying information basically to invade another cell and poop it out in there, right exactly. I mean, like they are the definition of um. I guess what Dawkins would have called the selfish gene. It just the whole purpose, if there is such thing as a purpose to the universe, the whole purpose of a virus is to create more viruses. That's it. And when you think about the effect that a virus like HIV has on human beings and has had on the entire population of humanity over the last few decades, to think that these viruses aren't even thinking that, they're not that all that, all of that is just a byproduct of its singular purpose, Yeah, of replicating itself. It's it's kind of astounding. It's just so, yeah, it is because it's just like the virus couldn't care less, because the virus couldn't care literally, it doesn't have feelings. It's just it's bizarre to think of it like that. Yeah, it's it truly is uh. So viruses, including HIV, they don't have cell walls or nucleus. Um. It's just those genetic instructions and it's got a little protective shell. Um. A virus HIV particle called a very of irene. I think both of those are acceptable all uh it is spherical uh and one ten thousand of a millimeter in diameter, and it has little buds sticking out of the top of it where it's basically it docks with the host cell. Yeah. So um, like you said, it's just some instructions to replicate itself. It's RNA strands wrapped in like a little um protective shell made of proteins and lipids, I think, and um, it enters the body and it goes straight for your lymph nodes. I believe, yeah, because that's where the T helper cells like to hang out. And of course because it wants to recaboc on your body, it goes straight there. And let's talk a little bit real quick about T helper cells. So basically you have T cells and they are like these they're like jaws from James Bond, Okay, Lurch from the Adams family, UM, and Jason Vorhees all rolled into one. As far as like white blood cells in your immune system, they are mindless, bloodthirsty, just killers. Lurch wasn't a bad guy, no, but he's scary, intimidating, and you do a pretty good lurch by the way. Um, I thought it was a great lurch. I appreciate it. So it's just these things, these things are just kind of hanging out. These T T cells are just hanging out waiting to be told what to do. So, okay, so there's one more character that they're like master blaster, but they need the master guy a little shrimp. And the little shrimp comes in the form of the the c D four plus T cells that the T helper cells. They go to the T cells and say, hey, get ready, get all wrapped up and go get those guys, right. So HIV goes right to the c D four plus T cells, the T helper cells, and that's its preferred cell to attack. Those are the ones that it hijacks. And it goes up and it docks with the CD four plus T cells and it it basically takes over, It hijacks it in turns those cells into HIV byrian factories. That is correct, sir. And more specifically, there are seven it's a seven part um process and how HIV invades the T cells. And yeah, because I don't know if we said that the replication is a really big part of HIV and why it's so devastating. Yeah, we did. We mention that we'll talk about a little more. Okay, let's let's just get to the nitty gritty though. Yeah, and we should point out to we're gonna talk about the drug cocktail later. And then each stage there's another there's a corresponding drug in the drug cocktail that helps disrupt this process. Yeah, it's like a very smart, multi pronged approach because the HIV virus is like what the hey, yeah, exactly going on here. I can't get anything done and it just leaves all right. So part one binding as when the HIV actually attaches to the immune cell, the T helper cell and they actually fused together. Yeah, there's special proteins. There's proteins on the helper cell that allow these things to dock with it. That's right. It's like a receptor's site almost. It's like a couple of rednecks and boats when they tie their boats together out in the lake from fourth of July. Right. I was thinking more like a space capsule in the I S S. But I guess that's a lower tech version of it, right next tying their boats. One man's space capsule is another man's party boat. Uh. Some some redneck boater who was listening to this and didn't realize he'd be implicated. It was like, hey, I'm not gay. He just said that to his his iPhone number two. Reverse transcription, Uh, reverse transcript days. It's a viral enzyme. It copies. We said that HIV was RNA initially correct. I don't know if we said that it's a retrovirus. So the the genetic instructions that are inside the virus is RNA, not DNA, right. But it goes through the reverse transcription process where the virus is RNA becomes DNA, right, And it just when it docks with the helper sell it does this little bit of work on its own. It says it's got this little enzyme. It runs it's RNA through it, and there's a DNA strand that it just built, right, correct, number three integration. Now you have your DNA and it is carried into the cells nucleus by something called viral integras binds what that sells DNA, and now you are no longer a retro virus. You writ provirus right. But then strangely, the cells DNA, the helper cells DNA takes this new instruction, these new blueprints, and spits out RNA again m rna correct. Right. It's it's called messenger RNA and it is instructions on how to build new HIV virans. It all sounds very sinister, it does, because if you think about it on A. On a cellular level, it is like, um, it's like I'm trying to kill this thing, right, but it's very insidious, and that it's it comes up with. It translates its own little instruction manual into the language of the cell, inserts it into the cells like main section the brain of it, and that makes the brain spit out new instructions that are taken to the rest of the cell. So it almost like it it gets the stamp of approval from the cell to go for the other parts of the cell to start building these new parts for the virus. Yeah, we're totally humanizing it by making it sound like it's nefarious, but it does seem that way. You know, it's very interesting. So that last step was called transcription. Then you have translation. You've got that m r n A at this point is carried back out of the cell. This is like a work order, Yeah, exactly, carry back out of the cell and then basically follows a natural progression where these long chains of proteins and enzymes are strung together by the own cells, own functions, and own components. Yeah, it just starts doing its normal thing, right, but it's not doing its normal stuff any longer. What it's doing is using its energy and time to build new HIV viruns rather than go prime T cells exactly. Uh. Part six assembly the RNA and viral enzymes they get together at the edge of the cell, and another enzyme called proteas basically cuts. I don't really understand this part, So imagine what's more like making one cell at a time, having somebody just spit out a whole bunch of the same parts, and then assembling them later. One of the steps of assembly is cutting them into individual bits from these long chains of polypeptides, and then finally, butting is when it actually splits off. It pinches out from the cell membrane becomes its own thing, and one of the key components there is it doesn't have to destroy the host cell in the process. No, it doesn't. UM. There's a lot of viruses out there that just keep building and building and building until they literally rupture the cell, and that's how they spread through the body. These like say, hey, thanks for a little bit of that lipid action, I'm now a new HIV virus and UM. But you can keep going on and build some more virans. I don't have to destroy you to spread. It's really a nasty, nasty disease. It really is how it works. So eventually the the helper cell does figure out that there's something terribly wrong and it it self destructs. But this makes the whole thing even even worse. So the CD the c D four plus T helper cell is not out there doing what it's supposed to be doing, priming T cells to attack the HIV instead of spending its time making more HIV. And then when it finally is like, this has messed up. Something's really wrong. I need to self destruct. It actually signals other c D four plus he helped ourselves to come surround it, and then it basically blows up, taking them with it. Yeah, it's like a mass suicide. It's yeah, it's like it's like a massacre down there on the cellular level. Yeah. So this is one of the things that makes HIV so insidious. All Right, I think we need to take another break because people's minds are exploding at this point and hopefully expanding, so we'll be right back after this. Um chuck. One of the things we also have to mention about HIV and UM one of the other aspects that makes it so difficult to cure or to even treat. Um. In addition to these cells like being hijacked, some of these irons that are being produced are just going off and accumulating in other cells, but they're not hijacking it, right, So as far as the cells concerned, there's nothing weird going on. There's nothing worth blowing yourself up over. It's just um, there's just some extra little virus hanging out on my surface. But who cares, It's fine. And these start to spread over that decade from infection to the onset of symptoms, they start to spread and accumulate throughout the body and the growing area and your bone marrow and your lymph nodes, like all over your bodys Yes, they form HIV reservoirs, right, And since these things can just hide out and they're not active and then they can become active whenever, it makes HIV a chronic, lifelong disease, and it makes it really really difficult to eradicate because the body mounts its own defense against the HIV infection. Initially, it's those reservoirs that become more and more widespread and increasing number to where they finally get to a point where your viral load is what it's called. There's just so many HIV viryans infecting so much of your body that when they do start to finally become active, it just totally overloads your c D four count and your number just goes down, and all of a sudden you have the stage three year four HIV, which is again is AIDS and um we uh yeah, thanks for pointing that out. Um, I think that one of the also more dangerous parts is those reservoirs are invisible in that right, like immunologically speaking, Yeah, and you know, it's just like there's a there's a virus on the on the protein outside and that's it. And we're gonna talk about the AIDS cocktail and stuff. But even though it is effective, I think they said it's it's um, it's so slow moving that it will require sixty to eighty years of the cocktail therapy to completely eradicate the virus. In other words, you can't completely eradicate the virus. I mean technically good. It depends it to be very old when you were very young. If you acquired it at age ten and you lived to age ninety, then technically you could probably completely rad KHIV. That's not the way that this goes though, you know. Yeah, well no, but there have been plenty of kids who get it through other ways, you know. Yeah, I mean like you can be infected as a fetus, um and again through breastfeeding. I think are two of the ways you said, right, yeah, and you know with I think Ryan White got it through a blood transfusion, didn't heah is, Well we'll talk about that too, man. There's so much future goodness coming. All right, Well, we're gonna close this episode out with some stats. UM. I went to uh, and this is for the United States. We've already given some worldwide stats, but geez, where to start. There's so many UM. Estimated incidents of HIV has remained stable in recent years, about fifty thousand new HIV infections per year in the United States. But like we said, some groups UM are worse off than others. Uh if you go by groups UM. And this is where categorizing sexuality gets so tricky, because you can say homosexual men, bisexual men, or this term that was invented in the mid nineties m s M men who have sex with men, which is meant to be a neutral term. Yeah, that's not casting any judgment or anything that right. It also takes into account dudes are into like download stuff who don't self identify as gay, right, Um, like I'm not gay bisexual, I just have sex with men exactly every Wednesday, you know, in the park. Yeah, and those those people would be counted in this correct Uh. And there's we might as well say, there's there's the very people who created that term in the science community. Um, some of them are now lobbying to have that term removed or used more sparingly, I think is another interpretation. Yeah, And the thought is and it makes a lot of sense, is uh. And there's also women sleeping with women us w Uh, it says, and I'm gonna read this directly, so don't goof it up, said ms M and w SW often imply a lack of lesbian or gay identity and absence of community networks and relationships in which same gender peerings mean more than merely sexual behavior. Uh. Plus it's ex sense. They are also saying that it's overly broad too, that you're really not taking into account specifically who you're talking about, you know, like if you're lumping in Wednesday download guys with um, you know, men who have been openly homosexual since age sixteen who are now sixty. Those are two totally different communities and in most ways, absolutely and to lump them in together, especially if you're if it's an epidemiological paper, for example, that's that's doing a disservice to the person you're writing the paper for. So they're there, they propose to just be more specific, like you don't have to get do away with MSM. But say you know Wednesday downlow ms um right, you know, when you're talking about a specific population and in your study site, the the type of subgroups that you study that participated in the study, like you had twenty Wednesday download ms M, you had uh thirty old gay guys. Surely there's other abbreviations that could come out of this, but they're saying, just be more scientific about this show. We yeah, and I think it started out with a well meaning, well intended thing, but um there, you know, this whole thing is evolved. Everyone's learning how the best deal with terminologies, you know, and we've in ten years there'll be more specific terminology. You know, what are you about to say he had a good joke like give everybody a break. We're all learning as we go. Yeah, we are. We're in this together. So but risk group wise. Uh. And of course it says MSM here right after we said all that. Uh. They represent about four percent of the male population is all in the United States in two thousand ten, they accounted for seventy eight of new HIV infections and of all people living with HIV UH in the United States. So and you know, we got to the reasons why that you know is happening earlier. Uh. And then the UM, let me see here, injection drug users represent eight percent of new infections in two thousand ten. Women accounted for twenty of estimated new infections in two thousand ten. And UM, what's scary there is there's been a rise UH in HIV infection and women increase from two thousand eight to two thousand ten. You know that's going in the wrong direction. I didn't see it in my research anywhere, but I didn't specifically look for it. UM, so take it with a grain of salt. But I remember hearing not too many years ago that UM HIV was on the rise among the elderly population really thanks to viagra. That there's been a far greater increase in sexual activity and retirement communities or nursing homes even sure because of viagra, and they're there, but they're just not taking precautions because they're like, I'm you know, I'm eighty. Yeah, that's fine, but apparently HIV is totally makes on the rise among that population. We need to do one on viagra. Actually looked at the article the other day to suggest it and it was hard. Oh was it? Yes, it was. It was dense and difficult, So yeah, bad, bad guy. UH. African Americans and minorities in general. UM Africa. African Americans represent twelve percent of the population but accounted fort of new infections in two thousands ten and I wish we had more recent stats, but we don't. Apparently that's the most most instantly available, which is surprising. And the same with Hispanic Latino UH a disproportionate affected by HIV compared to their population. So then I was like, well, why is this happening? UM. As far as African Americans and are concerned, there's a lot of debate on what's going on there. UM, but they have found more infections, a shorter survival period, an increased number of deaths, and the most leading theories are poverty, that they may be more likely to be uninsured and go to the doctor to begin with. UM, injection drug use. Uh, the increases increases the spread of HIV. And I guess what they're saying is there's less safe injection drug use in the African American community or less responsible like getting new you know, and stuff like that. Uh, there's like a heroin epidemic going on right now. I don't think just with the black community. As a matter of fact, it's even more popular among like white kids than Black kids right now. But I wonder how much of an effect that's having on the spread of HIV among everybody. Yeah, good point. Uh. And then the last couple of lack of information, Um, you may not you may be HIV positive and you don't even know it. And we I know, we talked before about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments and how they're that has led to a general distrust UM and some corners of the African American community against the medicine and doctors overall. And then finally a stigma. There's a stigma in the black community. UM that still is a gay, white disease. And that's why when Easy got AIDS it was such a big deal. It was the illuminati who injected him with it. Was that one of the theories. You're kidding? Uh yeah, I mean that was why he was a really big deal, because he put a face to a certain segment of the black population where they're like, wait a minute, you know it's easy can get it. Anybody can get it. Yeah, it's true. Uh so those are the reasons they think it's spreading more in the in the minority communities. Um, and are we done with part one? I think so? So. Do you remember um when they would do like a very serious two part different strokes at the end. Normally they would clap at the end, but at the end of part one, it would just like go quiet, Yeah, I got no listener mail for this. I think we should do that. Okay, So how do we set this up? I think we just stopped talking for more on this and thousands of other topics. Is it how stuff works? Dot Com
