Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of five Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w. Action, Jackson Bryant, right, sure, and then there's Jerry over there, the flash that makes this stuff. You shure, that's right. If there's one thing people say to me is how much I'm like Carl Weathers and how speedy Jerry is. Why why do I want to say that Carl Weathers had one arm in Action? Jackson? I don't think that was the case. Has he ever had one arm in any of his Oh? I think his arm gets pulled off in Predator? Okay, then I'm complaining the two. It sounds about right. I saw Predator, but just once, like you know, when it came out. I saw it within the last twelve months. Yeah, I think it's even better now has a grown up. Oh yeah, yeah, I can really feel the tension like you're in the jungle there with everybody. It's amazing. Have you been singing the Buffalo Soldier song like constantly in her head? Despite my best efforts, I can't stop. Well, I looked up the lyrics because I was just you know, I know some of them, Uh, but I wanted to kind of see where exactly he was probably talking about the soldiers, and there were some kind of on the nose references. Jerry mentioned San Juan mentioned San Juan. What else you know? Fighting for America, fighting on arrival, fighting for survival. Always I always got it wrong though. I thought he said dreadlock rock star. No, he says dreadlock Rosta. I know. I learned that today, Dreadlock rock star. I've been seeing well. I thought he was talking about himself. That's hilarious. I was singing it wrong. I mean he was singing about himself. No, he's singing about the Buffalo soldiers. They weren't Rosta's. I guess some of them could have been. Maybe we'll find out. Anyway. I've been singing for forty years, Dreadlock rock star. That's pretty good, like a dumb dumb Oh, that's all right. It's pretty close, man, And it still makes sense. The ones that don't make sense are the hilarious ones that just seems like a very like, I don't know, white college kid thing to sing dread like rock star, dreadlock. Yeah, when you first started listening to Bob Marley. Okay, you're ready, I'm ready. So we're talking Buffalo Soldiers. And then it is not just a Bob Marley song. It's if anything, that Bob Marley song is kind of like a his story history lesson, which is kind of interesting. Um, but the Buffalo Soldiers was the name of some all black regiments and then eventually all black soldiers in the United States fighting in the United States military. That's right from right after the Civil War all the way up until I think nineteen fifty one, when the last all black regiment was disbanded and the military was impracticed desegregated. Yeah, but when did you say that happen? I think nineteen fifty one. Um, But they did not take on that natal post Civil Civil War, right, And at first it wasn't a name that they took on themselves. It was a name that was given to them. And there's a lot of dispute over where it came from, who's the first to use it, that kind of stuff. But it's a really interesting history and it's not just an interesting like military history. There's a lot of like terrible tragic irony involved. There's, um, there's this kind of overarching theme where you can make a case that the Buffalo Soldiers are the ones who actually paved the way for desegregation throughout the entire United States. You can trace a direct line from their service to desegregation. It's pretty pretty amazing stuff. And yet there's still this kind of um cloud that hangs over them historically because of one of the things that they participated in, which was the genocide of Native Americans at the behest of the white US government, right because they were trying to earn a place in white America and gained some status and prestige, and white America was like, we want you to do something for us first, and we'll still probably not grant you that respect. Yeah, which is kind of par for the course from what I understand as far as military service and being black in America goes UM. In the Battle of New Orleans, the Black Phalanx, this black regiment ended up pretty cool name. Yeah, it really is. Um. They ended up basically winning the battle UM against the British at the Battle of New Orleans, which actually came ironically after the end of the War of eighteen twelve, but it was still a decisive battle UM and they had been Mustard, a lot of them from local plantations by Andrew Jackson, and Jackson had promised them their freedom if they came and fought in one. And they came and fought in one and Jackson said, yes, are you have to go back to your plantations? I was lying, yeah, and that's not a surprise. Yeah, but um, imagine that And that was not the first time that that had happened to him. That was pretty much par for the course. While they were enslaved. They would be promised freedom for fighting and then no, after the fact, that's just not that's not gonna happen. Yeah. And you know, like we said, the Buffalo soldiers post Civil War were and we'll we'll get to um like their formal designation and their regiments and stuff like that. But there had been uh individuals enlisted in all the way back to the Revolutionary War. There were you know, black individuals that would go and fight, but they just weren't grouped in their own regiments. The first one was the Black Regiment in Rhode Island. I think. Yeah, in the Revolutionary War, didn't we talk about them in a short stuff about um the Black Revolutionary war fighters? And they moved up to Nova Scotia. We definitely did. So the Grabster put this a lot of this together for us, which was a big help. And it's important to look at what was going on after the Civil War and this unique set of circumstances that were created that kind of led to these regiments being formed, which was about twelve thousand maybe a little bit more black veteran soldiers from the Civil War all of a sudden needed jobs and they were soldiers at this point, so they were like, you know, I'll keep doing this. This could be my career. Like give us a job in reconstruction in the South, they needed federal troops. Federal troops, well, yes, it was probably not a good idea to send black troops for to oversee reconstruction, so to occupy the South, can you imagine it would not have been So they sent white troops of course, but that created a vacuum elsewhere where they could use and utilize these black troops. Um, there were four million slaves that were now free and uh ed hazard a guess that you know, let's say a million one and a half million of these were adult males that were ready to go and serve and fight. If need be. And then we were going west, and we knew that there were Native Americans out there that we're not going to go easily. There was Mexico looming on the horizon as potential conflict. And because they were sending white soldiers to the south, Uh, they needed people to go out west and kind of you know, keep the peace in a way and take care of business in another way, or to remove Native Americans forcibly from their ancestral lands. That's right. So um on July sixty six, Congress did something really surprising. They said, we've got all these kind of expansionist ideas. We've got the South that we need to occupy. We need a bigger army. We're going to raise a huge peace time army. And not only that, we're going to form some all black regiments. Were going to let black people um enlist for the first time ever as peace time soldiers. Yeah, and partially because they just needed people, and partially because they thought these black veterans that fought in the Civil War for the Union they should be rewarded with jobs. Exactly. So, for the first time, the federal government didn't reneg on the offer of something better. After having served and fought as a soldier. So there's a big deal and just having you know, allowing soldiers, black soldiers to enlist during peace time, but the fact that they could enlistment that they could become officers as well, which meant West Point was open to black UM soldiers for the first time, which was a huge deal UM in eighteen So in eighteen sixty six is when they expanded the army. Just a few years later they wanted to shrink the army a little bit, so they consolidated a bunch of regiments down to five and the original I think it was six uh for infantry and to cavalry were now shrunk down and combined into the ninth Cavalry, the tenth Cavalry. I'm saying both cavalry and cavalry, just covering all your bases, even though only one of them is correct in this cavalry, uh, the infantry in the infantry right. And the fact that they survived this downsizing of the army because Congress want we need a big army. It's too big, let's get rid of some some soldiers. The fact that all black regiments survived is really miraculous because in that downsizing decree a few years later. It wasn't um. It wasn't included, like and we still need to keep black regiments in intact um And William two comes to Sherman was no great friend to the black man by any stretch of the imagination. And he was in charge of downsizing these troops. And yet he knew enough that there were still congress people, congressmen in Congress who had created the black regiments in the first place. They would not be very happy if he just dissolved them, so he kept him in tech and actually just went from six to four. Yeah, and but it's interesting because it was peacetime. You know. During wartime, especially back then, it was really pretty easy to get people to sign up and volunteer and fight for whatever side they were on. But in peace time they found that they could get the cream of the crop of black soldiers because they didn't have as much opportunity, so they could really be picky and get these really like super capable fighters, whereas on the other side, uh, during peace time, it was harder to get white soldiers that were as capable because they had much more opportunities to do other things beyond like hey, I got nothing going on outside up for the army, right exactly. And in the army to um, there's a lot of mythologizing about, um, you know, how the black regiments were treated. It related to white regiments as well, and it seems like, um, some historians have shown if you trace the supply lines, the black bagment's got the same shoddy and then increasingly better supplies as the white regiments at the same time. And in the army you had just opportunities, um that just weren't afforded to you outside, like the opportunity to make money, you know, and have savings and a pension, um, things that you could you could kind of bank on the future with that. That was just not part of of the black experience of black men back then. You know. I think that's a very robust set up in more, Oh, we're still doing set up. No, let's beyond like That's why I said and more. But I think what I'm trying to say is it's a great time for a break. Okay, yeah, yeah, all right, we'll be right back and we'll talk a little bit about how this name came to be right after this. So there's a lot in here about how this name came to be, right, But I think we condense it um. We can condense it to just a couple of versions, one of which was that the name may have come from the Native Americans as sort of an honor, like they're brave and they fight, They're like fierce, like the buffalo and like Sasha fierce. I don't know what that is. That's like Beyonce's weird alias. Why do stars, when you get to this enormous, huge point, decided to create an alter ego? That's always not good? Chris Gaines, Yes, learn the lesson from Chris Gaines. Yeah, who else has done that? It doesn't matter, Chris, Some of them have worked. Zikky Starda certainly worked. Captain Fantastic worked fine. Chris Gaines, N it's all though, No, I agree, I didn't know that very short lived really and what was the persona was it? I guess she was fierce, so I don't know. I just heard her name a couple of times. Beyonce's fear though, right right, you don't need an alter ego, Beyonce. You're fierce enough. You don't want to go too much fiercer. You should be her manager should you know all the right moves. So that is that is one of the stories was that it was honor, a name of honor from the Native Americans. But this to me sounds like it might have been just something kind of cooked up in history books or it just kind of converted into that. Maybe the Smithsonian Museum of African American History says, yeah, that stands as popular lore. That's one um example. Another is basically there's two competing ones, and that is that the Native Americans did give this name to the black soldiers, but that they were referring to the woolyness of the black soldiers hair compared to white soldier's hair, and that if you look between the horns of a buffalo, that kind of like to pay almost that the buffalo is wearing bears of vague resemblance to it, and that that's where it initially came from. Yeah, and there's like direct evidence from letters and stuff of the time of this um whether or not it was true or not. It was it was at least down in print as being the reason, but we don't know for sure, uh, And we don't know for sure how they felt about the name other than it seems like as time went on, they kind of embraced the name as a designation UM. And in one case there was one troop that did use a bison on a patch on their uniform, but then bison were used on other patches on uniforms of white soldiers too. I think it was strictly Black regiments really, just later ones that weren't the ninth That that was my interpretation, okay, but but yeah, by the time I think nineteen eleven is when that first patch appears. But so by the time teen eleven rolls around, the Black regiments had UM had totally like taken on Buffalo soldiers a name of honor. Yeah, and and Ed points out, I think it's fair. It's easy now in to look back at UM two uh, two ethnic groups that were you know, kept under the thumb of the white man and say that, oh, you know, the Native Americans respected them as fierce fighters, and the Black soldiers respected the Native Americans. But that's probably retroactive revisionist history, because you know, there were plenty of cases where the Buffalo soldiers referred to them as you know, savages, and one case of one soldier you know, going as a costume party, dressed up and I guess what you would call red face, Oh yeah, and uh so, yeah, it seems like that's sort of cooked up these days, like they really had much respect for one another during their battles. But I don't know if that's a case. No, but you can understand how that would how people would want to do that, you know, because I mean, the sending African American soldiers out to remove Native Americans from their land with violence at the behest of white people. It's not a good story. No, it's a terrible story. Yeah, it takes a bad story makes it worse, and then at the same time, um, there's a real silver lining to it. There's that good story that like black soldiers served as heroes for the black community in America as a whole at a time when they really needed some black heroes, you know, and the Jim Crow South was really starting to to solidify. Um, So it's not like an all bad story, but it's definitely not an all good story either. So people want like a nice storybook ending for sure, which is surely where that came from. I think. So, so should we talk a little bit about, um what they did? Yeah, yeah, when they were um first assembled in I think that late to mid eighteen sixties. Um, they were almost immediately moved out to the frontier Kansas and Texas, New Mexico, UM, and pushing further and further west as their work was increasingly successful. Yeah, and usually under the command of white officers. UM. It was not looked at as some great assignment if you were a white officer, uh, to go west and command one of the Buffalo Soldier regiments. Yeah, it would have been like being stationed in Alaska or something like that. Alaska is great. Although some some white commanding officers did rise to the occasion, yeah, and had a lot of great things to say about the soldiers too. Some of them definitely did not rise to the occasion and actually went the other way, right, you know. Yeah, and you mentioned West Point. This was a huge deal because, like you said, now, these young men could go attend West Point and come out officers upon entry into the army. Uh. There were quite a few cases. One was a man named Henry Flipper. He was the first black graduate of West Point in eighteen seventy seven, came out as second lieutenant in the tenth Cavy Cavalry and was basically set up with a court martial. There was a case where there was some He was put in charge of a quartermaster safe to like guard it basically and take charge of it. Money becomes missing, he uh kind of freaks out and lies about it. It's kind of all evidence pointing to the fact that he didn't take the money, but he did lie about. How did he went? What did he lie about? Thinks I couldn't I think that the initial money was missing at all. Maybe I'm not really sure, but it looks like it was a set up. He was acquitted of the main charge even back then, and was found guilty of an added charge of conduct unbecoming of an officer right uh and was dismissed from the army, which even back then was an overblown sentence compared to the similar charges of white officers right into the army at the time. He could have gotten his discharge changed to honorable discharge, but the Army apparently didn't have any procedure to do that, so it was up to the commander in chief, Chester A. Arthur Uh to decide yea or nay, And he just for he just let it pass by. But he so um lieutenant. Was he a lieutenant second lieutenant second lieutenant Flipper went to his grave saying that he was innocent, and um he In the nineties, Bill Clinton finally pardoned him. He did, and Clinton that ghoul ordered him exhumed and reburied with full military honors. But they suspect that Clinton just wanted to see what the body looked like. Come on, he said, let's do this, right. Yeah, he probably did say that. So there were another couple of cases, John Hanks, Alexander and Charles Young. Uh, they were West Point grads early on. They went on to lead these regiments. And uh, that's not to say that at West Point it was smooth Salem. Of course. You know, they had a very hard time there and still persevered extraordinarily. Um points out that in the Tuskegee Airman Episode two, I think we talked about how the um, those guys who went through West Point had or the military academies had just an awful time of it too. I mean that happened. I mean it probably still happens to some degree. But I mean I read The Lords of Discipline. I did too, and saw the movie. I don't know if I saw the movie or not, and that was what year was that set that was? It's probably sixties, wasn't. I don't know what was the problem with that guy. He just was soft or something, wouldn't it he like was was um ah, he had feelings, you know, I don't remember. I haven't seen it in a long time. But um, that was the Citadel, not West Point, which is Navy, I think, right, Air Force Marines. The Citadel is National Guard. No cub Scouts, Yes, it was cub Scouts. Citadel was cub Scouts where the break. So uh, these regiments had about a thousand troops and officers. But um, they were constantly under supplied. And like you said earlier, it's there's no evidence that they were intentionally undersupplied. No, but it's a myth that they were. Yeah, but kind of everyone out west was because it takes a long time to get stuff out there, and a lot of those old Civil War weapons and equipment were pretty shoddy anyway. Yeah. Plus, I mean it's not really easy to come by water in the New Mexico desert or you're fighting the Cheyenne or the Apache, um like, so you have horses that need water too, because you're a cavalry unit. Um, and the horses were breaking down. It was a really bad time as they were moving further and further west. Because we tend to think of the United States military like in the terms of today, this just incredibly well oiled, logistical juggernaut. That was not the case after the Civil War. As a matter of fact, until I believe the Spanish American War, the United States military was looked upon internationally is kind of like a not not the best around, certainly not the best equipped the logistics. We didn't have that kind of stuff down. You didn't hear it from me, but right exactly. But um, and this was you know, the army that these guys were enlisted in, So they were dealing with an army that was not was finding its feet and then also on the frontier of the United States at a time when they're protecting the people building the railroads. So there's not even the railroads out there yet. One of their jobs was to protect railroad workers, mail carriers, people who were on trattle drives. Yeah, um, these were the jobs they were asked with. Uh. Well, they were also fighting, like we said, in what was known as the Indian Wars, uh, including some of the some of the big ones. I think we need to do a big old episode on the any wars. Yeah, let's do it. Wounded Knee, the White River War. Yeah, I've never heard of that one. I looked it up. The war is not a term for most of these. Should be massacre now, it should be straight up massacres. Yeah. Although here's the other thing too, This is really easy for guys like us to do, especially in retrospect, is um what's called like mythologizing the noble savage right where the where we kind of make it seem like the Indians were just the people who, you know, kind of meekly accepted their fate and we're just rolled over by the US government through this westward expansion. That's not the case. In almost every case, the further west we got, the fears of the fighting got, they pushed back. For sure. They engaged in massacres that included killing women and children and non combatants on both sides did so. It's not like the Native Americans were just innocent of of bloodshed. But it's important to remember that they were. They were defending their lands from invaders. They were the insurgents, and that so there's like a certain amount of um moral higher ground that they afforded just for being in that position, you know. But it's just that's the thing. That's why I've always been fascinated about histories, Like it's never just you know, black and white. Yeah, there's so much nuance that gets overlooked, especially if you were raised in like you know, public schools in America. Exactly, not a lot of nuance going up right, and white people swooped in and everything was great, exactly. So by the eight nineties, the Indian Wars ended, um, the reservations popped up, or they were just flat out massacred, like you said, or imprisoned. And this is when the Buffalo Soldiers ar died, uh taking part in some of the land disputes out west with white settlers. Yeah, the removal of the Sooners in Oklahoma, that's huge, huge, because all of a sudden, black regiments show up and they're like you, you might be white, but you need to get out of here because you didn't follow the rules. That's a huge change from a decade or so before, when like those people would have been enslaved in the South. It's it's a big deal. What else. You mentioned San Juan from the Bob Marley song. Yeah, that's that was when they entered the national stage for the first time. Yeah, fighting in Cuba in Puerto Rico. Yeah, it's very confusing. They fought at the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba and the Battle for San Juan in Puerto Rico. That's right under the tenth Regiment under the command of a guy named General John Pershing, who you might be familiar with, is known as Blackjack Pershing, the famous World War One general. Yeah, I had heard, I knew, I had heard of him. He was named black Jack because he was in command of the Black Red amainst the tenth Cavalry, And I mean I think in the First World War he was a little less um willing to stand up and like advocate for them, but by the time World War Two came around, he was okay. So I didn't hear about the World War Two part. But that was a pretty big betrayal in World War One because he led the tenth Cavalry up San Juan Hill in Cuba, um along with the rough Riders, along with White infantry. The This battle was one of the first ones right before the turn of the twentieth century. Um where there were if you were standing back, like looking at this battle, there's black guys, there's white guys. There's black guys on horses, there's Spanish people coming down here, like there's all these people. But the black um soldiers and the white soldiers were intermingling, fighting together, side by side, and they won. And Teddy Roosevelt said it was all me. I I won the Battle of Cuba San Juan in Cuba. But historians say, actually, no, these black regiments, specifically the tenth Cavalry, really won this battle in the Spanish American War down in Cuba, and it was huge. It put the Buffalo Soldiers on the map for really the first time ever in the American popular consciousness, and like um, black families around America, like you could go into their dining room and there'll be a print of like a painting of the Battle of San Juan with the Buffalo soldiers storming the hill like um. One historian put it that they were there that generation's Jackie Robinson and Joe Lewis, like they were the heroes, Like I was saying they were the heroes at a time when Jim Crow Laws were really coming into into force and have really really bleak time for Black America. All of a sudden, there's these buffalo soldiers that basically helped win the Spanish American War, fighting alongside white soldiers too and being equal in that respect. And that's why you'll see all those statues right next to Teddy Roosevelt exactly exactly. And you know what, I may have made up that part about General Pershing advocating wor wor World War two, now that I think about it, Oh well, that was I didn't get to the betrayal thing, chuck. So when World War One roll rolled around, he was in charge of I think basically everybody in Europe, and he turned his back on his black regiment and all black soldiers and basically said, no, you guys fighting your own regiments. So I don't want you fighting side by side. And but the French were like, hey, come fight with us, we'll we'll command you. And that happened. That reminded me. The French were also the first ones to recognize officially the Native American code talkers, even before the United States did. Remember that, and they also used black aviators in World War One two, So up with the French historically speaking, there's a teacher that gave us those fries and that bread. You mean, freedom fries, freedom bread. I feel like I'm talking a lot, am I I mean, no more than usual, Okay, read them. So in World War Two, the Buffalo Soldier units were used a lot um a lot of times. Though they were not on the front lines. They were stuck to administrative and support duties. Um. But they did join in combat here and there, uh and on both the theaters in the war. Um, mostly towards towards the end of World War two. Um. But it was you know, a lot of this, A lot of the good that you see coming out of what the Buffalo Soldiers did was foundation work and groundwork for desegregating the military, for showing that these guys are just the same as white soldiers. They're just as capable, they fight just as bravely. Um. And it really kind of laid that groundwork for the desegregation after the war. Yes, like a direct line for it. It's weird, but they basically a way to put it is that the white America said, okay, all right, if you will, we'll give you a shot. You go out and serve in battle, and let's see what you what you can do, and then maybe we'll see what we'll see from there. And just by being given that one opportunity two to show that they could do things that were presumed they couldn't, like act bravely and fight um and be a good soldier, that was like, you know, good at being a soldier. They proved that all of these myths about how black people couldn't do these things were wrong. And that kind of thing opens up some people's eyes too. Okay, well, what else do I think about black people that are wrong? And it's weird to think about because on a on a um, on a social level, that that's what it takes, that that people's minds can be changed like that. But historically, speaking in retrospect, like that's how it happens, you know, like one prejudice is tested and then all of a sudden, other prejudices start lowly, yeah, kind of kind of falling over like dominoes, totally, very very slowly. Though unfortunately, like dominoes, you can only picture falling fast. I know, do that in SloMo. It's almost a terrible analogy almost, so it's crazy to think, but um. Even though desegregation happened long before this, it takes a while for that to fully happen. And they were Buffalo soldier units in the Korean War, all black units in the Korean War. There was but it was I think that Truman signed this act disagregating the military. Yeah, and I think it was took three more years. Nineteen fifty one was when the final the final one was disbanded. Right. But that's why I was saying you could trace a direct line of disaggregation from the military, because that was the first chance that Black America had to show that it could be treated equally and that it could act equally. Um. And they showed that, and it led to disagregation in the military. And then three years after the actual in practice disegregation of military regiments, there was the Brown Versus Board of Education ruling, which not in practice but in theory disegregated schools. So it went army schools and then eventually socially it just kept going. Yeah, but it was because of the Buffalo soldiers and in their service directly, undisputedly. Oh yeah, I mean that's crazy to think. As late as the Korean War, though some of those units were still fighting. Ye, it is because when I think of Match, it doesn't feel modern, but it doesn't feel like Buffalo Soldier territory. Right, Yeah, the Buffalo Soldiers you think of like nineteenth century American West, nine fifties Korea. No, you don't think of Hawkeye and his jen Still. I guess there was one black character on Match with a very unfortunate name, but we won't talk about that. I'm not familiar. All right, Well, I think we should take a break and come back and talk about what is to me one of the cooler aspects of this whole story, the Bob Marley song. No, we'll be right, all right, We're back, and we're going to talk about what I think is one of the coolest little parts here of this whole story, which I never knew. If you've ever been to Sequoia National Park or Yosemite National Park or some other national parks out west, and you're hiking a trail or driving down a road, you might have the Buffalo Soldiers to thank for that trail in those roads. Uh. They and it's one of their their highlight achievements to me is once we established the national parks Teddy Roosevelt again build statues of him. Right. Um, you had to enforce this stuff because this was the first time we were like, wait a minute, this is protected land. You can't just come in here and take the timber or hunt, you know, the animals. Like, there are rules now, you set up like you set aside grazing lands, set aside national parks. Libertarians they take issue with that kind of thing, and you need to have buffalo soldiers to fight them off. That's right. So from to nineteen thirteen, about twenty five years or so, these some of these black regiments were essentially the first park rangers. They didn't have that name at the time. Um, but they kept the poachers at bay and stopped the illegal grazing and the timber thieves. Uh they fault wildfires. Yeah. I didn't get a chance to really look into this, but I wonder what nineteen thirteen wildfire fighting was. Like, I'll bet it was real dicey bucket brigade stuff. Probably like firefighting is dicey wildfire fighting, but a hundred years ago, man, I hopet it was. I can't imagine. God, but like I said, with the trails and stuff, a lot of some of the more significant trails and roads. Some of the buildings, yeah, some of the older cabins, they were built and constructed by Buffalo soldiers, which is just super cool. Yeah. So if you find a building in Yosemite or Sequoia National Parks, that's yes, then it was probably built by Buffalo soldiers or hiking a trail. Yeah, this is all just super cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. They also rode bicycles around the place too, which is kind of neat. Yeah. Um, so, Chuck. The last Buffalo soldier, and I mean, like original Buffalo soldier, Mark Matthews. He died on September six, two thousand five. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. He was a hundred and eleven years old, and he actually fought under General Pershing in the tenth Cavalry on the hunt for Chovia. Oh yeah, yeah, I think I don't know if we mentioned that. How many medals of honor were there? Twenty three? I saw three. The National Museum of African American History says eighteen. I'm gonna go with them all right, somewhere between eighteen and twenty three, let's saying that. Yeah, So you know, the I guess the moral of the story is that they did provide this um direct line to desegregation, not only through the army, but, like you're saying, all through America. But sadly, a lot of them did exit the military. Um. Some of them did have a little uh higher status and a leg to stand on. Many of them didn't. Uh they were There was a study of lynchings in the US that found that black military veterans were targeted uh and lynched more the non veteran black people, with the idea that it was a real threat in uh, the racist white South for a black man to leave the army with some rank and some status and feeling good guns, feeling good about himself. Don't forgetting the Tulsa Maskre episode. It was the World War One bets who are like, uh, no, we're gonna go defend this boy from being winched with guns. They showed up with guns. I think, um, there, I remember in the Black Panther episode two. Um, they traced a direct line of this um the sense of like you need to defend yourself and protect yourself with firearms. They traced that directly to World War One veterans. Yeah, yeah, so there is a terrible logic to that, I guess. Yeah, for sure. There was also a terrible um senator and governor of Mississippi named James Vardaman who was just straight up white supremacist. Like, no matter how you slice it, you could have just said senator from Mississippi in seventeen Uh, he's He spoke to the U Senate and he really kind of crystallizes how they felt about black veterans. In nineteen seven on the Senate floor, he said, once you impress the Negro with the fact that he is defending the flag and inflate his untortured soul with military airs, his political rights must be respected. Um. And he wasn't saying like and that's great, Yeah, so let's respect that. Yeah, this was a warning basically, and he was over over looked. He didn't listen to him ultimately, because they did continue having black soldiers as soldiers and eventually desegregated, which led to de segregation in America, which is pretty great. That's right. I would love to hear from some current African American military personnel because I want to know what the current sort of temperature is as an active service person. Oh what the racism is like in the military. Yeah, sure, I'm sure you know that there will be different versions of that story depending on who you're in contact with and what your particular like platoon is like. Yeah. I wonder though, because the military is like some kind of weird similar acre of American society, and I wonder if it's more racist or less racist. I think there's a chance to go either way. I mean, my guess is less you know my uh, like I said, my brother in law before and is a marine and it's pretty high up, you could say. And every time I've been on these marine bases a lot, and it all seems like they're all sort of you know, got that thinking that group think going on, like we're just marines, like none of us are a color, we're green. Well I've seen full metal jacket, right, and there are a lot of racist stuff in there. I'm sure. Okay, Yeah, I could go either way. It could go either way. I would like to hear um that as well. I'd also like to hear from any Native American listeners to know what what they were taught about Buffalo soldiers to what was pushed down within the different tribes because they contacted all sorts of different tribes from the Lakota Sioux up in the north down to the Apaches in New Mexico and Mexico. Um, yeah, teach us everyone. Yeah, well we'll read them on listener mail. Uh. If you want to know more about Buffalo soldiers, there's a lot of really great stuff to read. Uh. And you can't really go wrong with a guy named Frank Schubert who is a scholar of them of Buffalo Soldiers, and he's got a lot of articles on the web and I believe some books too. Um. And since I said Frank Schubert, it's time for listener mail. Oh no, it's not. Oh, that's right. You know what it's time for hit him, Chuck. It is time for administrative details. So we haven't done this in a little while. If you're new to the show, administrative details is where we take a couple of minutes. We're gonna do this on this episode in the next you got that straight to read out some thank yous. Tell him Chuck for some of the kindnesses that people throw our way, that's right, whether they be uh, physical totems like T shirts and buttons and to confectioneries like cookies and pastries and Jesus that what I did not do on this one, and I feel bad because you probably did is write down all the names of all the postcards and letters I wrote down the ones that I I. Yeah, I think I've got basically everybody, And we should say we almost always miss somebody or a few. So if we don't say your name and you have not been thanked on a previous administrative detail, please get in touch with us so we can correct that. That's right. And if you have a letter or a postcard that is on my desk, I'll include those in the next batch because now I feel bad. Bam, All right, let's go through these.
