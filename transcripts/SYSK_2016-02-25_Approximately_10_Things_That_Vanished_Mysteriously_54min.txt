Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry over there. So this is stuff you should know the podcast. Wait, him and a Jerry's not there all of a sudden, it says she's vanished without a trace. No, she's right there. There's just a miso dust lingering in her where she once sat. Jerry, do you either want a So it seems like she's eating me so soup a lot, but she probably just did that once and I extrapolated that over years. She's eating Indian food right now. I know, our tiny little studio smells like we need a spice kitchen. You know what that is. It's a kitchen full of spice. Now it's a second kitchen for cooking really stinky food. I didn't know that. Yeah, huh, I need it. I want a spice kitchen so I can cook my rich game meets that Emily can't stand the smell. What's your favorite game meat? I'm just getting on like game meats. What do you like the stinky? Oh? I mean, dude, if I cook bacon or country ham or steak in the Josh Clark cast iron fan steak. It stinks at the house for two days. You know, She's just like, oh my god, like that animal in here. You need to get like good air purifier, air filter works works. Wonders. Well, we don't have a stove hood yet, you know. Yeah, which is that's probably the biggest rub. Yeah, And I think like, depending on the stove hood, I think someone are just kind of like, but there's ones out there that are really good. Yeah. I bet those are the expensive ones. Yeah, but I'll bet you can find a good one that's at a lower price point. Maybe, or maybe I could just hire a guy they got a window right behind the stove to just sit, a little short guy to sit in the window with some fireplace bellows. They'd be good. Or one of those people who like fan things with palm franz. Yeah, maybe that's cheaper. I don't know. But for the life of your stove, probably not weirdest start ever. So, Chuck, you remember when David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear. I remember it happening. I didn't watch it. You didn't watch it. No, I've never been a big fan of his his magic work. Even as a kid. Nah, not into it. Well, I guess you would have been about fifteen at the time. I could see you like being like, this is dumb. Yeah, so you were eleven. It was the coolest thing ever. Yeah. I was like, there's no way he's going to be able to do this. Oh my gosh, he did it? What I like? What is that? Even? I feel like, if I remember correctly, he put up basically a curtain around the Statue of Liberty and painted and the Statue of Liberty wasn't there. I'm sure it's all smoking mirrors. Well, of course it's you mean it wasn't real magic, but I don't think so. I'm pretty sure it wasn't dark arts, don't think so. I don't think Satan was involved. It was too patriotic for that, you know what I mean. Um, But anyway, my point is to this super lay intro is that David Copperfield brought the Statue of Liberty back. It didn't disappear forever. It just disappeared temporarily. It's amazing, But there are some things, mostly people and some socks that do just disappear forever that have disappeared forever, and who's like mystery mysterious disappearances are still unsolved to this day. It's pretty good. Do you lose a lot of socks? Uh? No, No, Umi does our laundry. She keeps tabs on the socks. Well, they make little tabs that you clip on keep your socks together when And I've also seen there's this one company that tried to sell socks and as three socks, so you always had a backup superfluous sock. But it didn't. I don't know if that took off like it should have. Coulda who knows the person who invented it. They know, believe me, they wake up every day and they're like, three sacks was a great idea. So let's talk about some of these things that have disappeared without a trace. Yeah, this is one of our famous top tens. It'll be what six eight, something like that, Solomon Northrop number one. Have you seen twelve years of late yet? Man? Still No. It's sitting on my DVR staring me in the face and watch daring me to be sad and watch it. You just gotta get it over with it. There's a certain amount of Catharsis to it. It's not just gonna bring you down to the depths of depression and leave you there necessarily. Yeah, I've been ticking off the really sad ones at a rate of about two per year. Like I just watched Beast of the Southern Wild like a few months ago. I haven't seen that one. That's a good one. Is it good? Yes? Very tough movie, is it? But yeah, long story short, I need to watch Twelve Years of Slave. Okay, I'm shamed. I didn't mean the same. I'm just saying it's like the third time I've been shamed. It's a kid. It's a good movie. So Solomon Northrop was the uh. He was the man who wrote the memoir on which the movie was based, because it's a true story about his life and he was born free uh an African American in eighteen forty one. Went well, it says here was lured from his home in New York to Washington, d C. And then kidnapped forced into slavery in Louisiana. Yeah, he was lured by being basically hired as a musician, and while when he went to d C, he was kidnapped and solding the slavery, and man, it just gets worse from there. Whe they're like, you should come down and play the nine thirty Club. Basically yeah, He's like, great, let's see it. And they're like, oh, there is no nine club. There's just horrific slavery on a plantation in Louisiana. Um. So he actually, uh spoiler alert for those of you, like Chuck who haven't haven't seen the movie, he um is basically rescued from slavery. He figures out a way to basically pass a message along in the people who know and can confirm that he was a born of Freeman, Um come and get him, which is pretty great. Uh. The and at the very end of the movie in it it says basically like the circumstances and date and whereabouts of Solomon Northrop's death are unknown. Okay, so they just finish it with a They do graphic, yes, but basically it's almost like an off handed thing. You don't think anything about it. But it turns out he he disappeared. It was mysterious. Yeah, he like people don't know where he went. He went back to the North and ended up working in the underground railroad. There's some um rumors that he became a spy for the Union during the Civil War. And it's so at some point he went you know, he wrote Twelve Years of Slave, Yeah, and he went on a book tour, um and abolitionist book tour, and he never came home from it. Yeah. In eighteen sixty three was about the last time that there were any records of his existence. And there are a bunch of different theories out there of what might have happened to him. Uh. One that while he was a spy he was captured and killed. One is that he was kidnapped again and sold into slavery. But um, I think I read that a lot of people just count out because he was kind of too old to be valuable at that point as a worker, yea. And or maybe he encount well, we know he encountered some financial difficulties, so maybe he just assumed a new identity and kind of skipped down. There's also one that's like the saddest but also probably the most realistic, that he died in a place where they didn't know who he was and they weren't inclined to to properly bury him, so he just led a regular life and died unknown, Yeah, or like he got run over by a horse or something on the book tour and no one knew who he was. He just thought he was like some African American, you know, or maybe even a slave and they just buried him in on mark Grave, Pauper's grave. Yeah, very sad. All right, Well that is uh, that's the first one. Um. I think Jimmy Hoffa is a great way to follow that up. Who Jimmy Hoffa? M hmm, famous teamster uh, teamster boss. I was reading a little bit about his huge beef with Bobby Kennedy. They hated each other. They didn't like each other, I mean hated each other. Like apparently Jimmy Hoffa shoved Bobby Kennedy at a restaurant once because he felt yeah, because he felt like he had snubbed him. Wow. Yeah, Jimmy Hoffa didn't like that kind of thing. Bobby Kennedy sent he wrote a book called The Enemy Within and it was about like the Mob and um, I'm not sure if Halfa was named in it or not, but it was basically like all of his friends. Bobby Kennedy wrote a book about it, and he sent a book a copy of it to Jimmy Hoffa, and he wrote a little inscription that said, to Jimmy, I wanted to make sure you've got a copy of this from me so you wouldn't have to use pension funds to buy one zing zing indeed, and he said have him killed. And he finally Bobby Kennedy finally got his mitts on Jimmy Hoffa and sent him to prison for a little while. But Halfa was a huge contributor to Nixon's campaigns against the Kennedy and so when Nixon became president, he'd pardoned Halfa. That's right, in nineteen seventy one, he was pardoned. And then on July thirtieth, n sventy five, just four years later, he went for a meeting at the uh macas Red Fox restaurant. It's a great name in Bloomfield, Michigan's great outside of Detroit, suburban Detroit. And he was never seen again, never seen again, disappeared, no bones, nobody, no nothing. And there's been tons of theories and suppositions and rumors about what became of him. Right, yeah, Supposedly he was there to meet um a couple of mafia bosses Anthony uh Gia Cologne and Anthony pro Bazan though which was no Tony Jack and Tony pro most were their nicknames. And um, they denied later that they had a meeting scheduled and they were they ended up actually having an alb because I read that and I was like, well, duh, he goes to meet with two mafia guys and disappears. But supposedly they had an alibi and they yeah, exactly, and they were not there. Um, so they were at church, yeah, with their mothers. There was a truck, like a you know, a semi truck pulling into the parking lot and almost hit got hit by this car pulling out of Mercury and he said he looked in and he saw Haffa in the back seat with another guy with what looked like a rifle like under uh, like a blanket in between them. Oh yeah, I mean the mafia killed Jimmy Hoffa. Yeah, there's virtually no dispute over that. It's just what happened to his body exactly. So some people said that he was buried under the old Giants Stadium in New Jersey, that the meadow Lands or is the new one at the meadow lands. The old well, the new one may be there too, but the old one was definitely there. Didn't happen? Did they ever dig it? Dig out the field? And look? No, I think the MythBusters actually went there with some equipment that could detect whether or not. Is there anything those guys couldn't do? I don't know, get along off the air. Yeah. Uh, we can also verify that um, a couple of weeks before he disappeared, hundreds of millions of dollars we're missing from the pension. And um again, you know no secret that the mafia probably had him done in right, So where's the body? Right? So? Um? And I think two thousand and fourteen, a guy named Tony Zarelli, another Tony, he wrote a book. Is that what his? I'm just kidding his his His book was called Half a Found and in it he detailed how half of his body was buried under some concrete slabs in a barn in upstate Michigan. I thought you gonna say it was a pop up book, and at the end he just pops up in right, here's half of um. You got me with that one. And apparently the FBI read this book and they went and dug up the field and didn't find anything. Yeah, they've looked. Um, they're quite a few locations in suburban Detroit that they've done some digging over the years, all yielding nothing. And there are other rumors he was fed to alligators in Florida. Quite possible. It would be a good way to get rid of a body and run through a wood chipper was another one. Yeah, I'll fargo. Yeah, I think they will never find him. I think. I also read that one um, supposedly reputable mafia source said, yeah, we killed him and we buried him in a shallow grave nearby, and we were supposed to move it, but we never did. So he's just, you know, not too far from the restaurant. Um. They're like, we never thought about that place. But I don't you know, I don't think they'll ever get anything. To be one of those enduring mysteries that is lazy who are too lazy to move a body to a better right, just leave him in the shallow grave? All right? Should we take a break, Yeah, why not? All right, we'll come back and talk about more disappearing X. I love this, Uh, one of these chuck, we should at least give a shout out to is the three guys who escaped Alcatraz. Oh yeah, and if you guys are interested in that, go listen to our entire episode on Alcatraz, where I believe we talked about this in depth. I hope. So I'm pretty sure we did, because if not, people are gonna be like, or just go watch the great Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. Yeah, because it's pretty darn accurate to the real story. Um, so we're gonna breeze by that one. I mean, we can talk about it if you want them, endlessly fascinated by. When we were in San Francisco for our most recent tour for Sketch Fest, Actually, did you go? No? I was. I ran down to the bay and looked out across it. I was like, I couldn't swim that, no problem. I wanted to go, but you gotta get reservations far in advantage. Sure, I've never been to Alcatraz. I want to go. Yeah. I was like, let me call and get tickets and they were like, we've been sold out for weeks. I'd also like to go take a tour of Eastern State pen the Tentry one of those old like crazy asylums. Yeah, I would love to do that. It'd be pretty cool, all right, Well, yeah, let's talk about it, why not. Yeah. Nineteen sixty two, Frank Morris and the Anglan brothers, Johnny and Clarence. They were bank robbers. Frank Morris is sort of a lifelong crook. Yeah, very very super intelligent guy who had escaped from several prisons. Uh. And finally they said, you know what, We're gonna put you in Alcatraz because it's inescapable. It's like the Titanic of prisons. You saw what happen with that. So they devised a brilliant plan over the course of several months, along with a guy named Alan west Um who sadly was left behind um to Uh, he wouldn't wake up. No, he couldn't fit through, he couldn't get his little vent open. They what they did was they carved out in vent over the course of months with like these little homemade chisels. He ain't too much bread pudding in the meantime, maybe, I mean the guys tried. They were trying to kick out from the other side, and eventually like we gotta go do so Um. The plan was over the course of months to carve out this space to get out, work their way through the guts of the prison to the roof, slide down some drain pipes, and then swim away with homemade life vests made out of raincoats that they had collected and glued together. But didn't they run into like some construction or something like that that just totally through their their plan off, improvise and go around, and it just was exponentially harder than they thought it was going to be getting out, I believe it. But they made life rafts out of raincoats that they sewed together to inflate, well, glued them together. Yeah, that's awesome. It is awesome. And they also made um bodies, well heads at least, right, Yeah, paper mache heads to lay in their bunks that um, you know, they look like paper mache heads in the light, but when you're walking the rounds at night and it's just sort of tucked into a pillow under some blank ets with real human hair from the barbershop, it fulled the guards. Yeah. Really, don't they have those on display in Alcatraz still? Oh, I'm sure they do. And here's a neat little fact that I didn't know until my friend Stacy told me. The they didn't have cold water in Alcatraz because they didn't want you to be able to acclimate yourself to the frigid baywaters over time. So all the water was warm, luxurious, the bay waters about fifty degrees. It's like an omni it is And uh, they don't know, I mean the FBI, and everyone says now they died for sure. That says that about everybody. They can't catch you now they're dead. There's no way. Just don't bring it up again, right, just shut up. Uh, they don't think they could have survived the swim. Um. The original plan was to go to Angel Island, go to the opposite side of the island, and then swim to Marin. I guess open a coffee shop. I guess me dely right. When they crossed the county, they were imbued with wealth. I don't know if they made it or not. Apparently a couple of weeks later there was a freighter ship that saw a body floating. Uh, they didn't report it until October though. They went from July to October and then said, oh, by the way, we saw body floating. That looked like he was wearing prison denims. They finally got to that on their to do list. They're like, oh, yeah, report dead body. Well it's a fraighter ship. They didn't care, you know, their laws, their allegiances to the sea, not a man on land. And they also found a few pieces of other evidence. Um, they found a life vest with teeth marks near the valve and um, human teeth marks. Yeah, human teeth marks. Yeah, not Barracuda teeth marks. Isn't someone who was probably holding it in their teeth trying to blow it up while they were swimming. Where would they have gotten a life vest? Oh, I don't know. I think it was one of the homemade ones. Oh well, so, I mean that doesn't mean anything. They could have ditched. Well that's what I said. And the fact that the body was unidentifiable. Yeah, and they never uh, they never you know, resurfaced. The plan was to rob a store on Angel Island and get clothing, and there were never any robberies planting. You know. That's kind of about That's a little telling, although they could have been like, I'm too cold to rob anything, let's just go to Muran and hug Yeah. Uh so who knows. Pretty neat, pretty neat? Indeed, when was that cool? I think we'll never know, just like the rest of these unexplained mysterious disappearances. Should we move on to the candy heiress. Yeah, Helen Brock. Um, I can't remember where I saw something. I saw it. I guess the documentary on this case. It's amazing. It's an amazing true crime cold case. Helen Brock's mysterious disappearance. And this our own article gets a little bit wrong. Um, but let's talk about it, okay. So Helen Brock was the heiress to the Brock Candy fortune because her husband and Frank Brock um it, was a co founder of the company and when he died, he left his wife Helen. Um, I think, basically everything. And she was a very very wealthy woman, and she liked to do things like go to the Mayo Clinic to get her annual physical like Mr Burns, although she was nothing like Mr Burns from what I understand. She was a very um, lovable, conscience is cool person. Um. But she was very very wealthy, so why not go to the Mayo Clinic? Back in she went to the Mayo Clinic and got to work out, and the last reliable person to see her alive was a woman who was working at the Mayo Clinic gift shop where Mrs Brock stopped to get a gift for her niece. A Mayo Clinic snow globe exactly right, right, yeah, what else? Anything else? Spooned spoon to Mayo Clinic spoon. People click those, uh Mayo Clinic sock puppet. Big seller. So she said to the lady, I'm in a hurry. My house man is waiting. House man was one Jack Matlick, and she was never seen again. Um, Mattlick had dropped her off. Obviously it's for the outbound flight to Minneapolis. And then he said, no, man, she came back. I picked her up. And then she spent four days. I didn't call anyone, but she was here home at home, even though there's no evidence to corroborate this, right, And then he said he dropped her off again at the airport, had to go to Florida, right where she had a condo. Correct. And it was when she didn't show up in Florida as planned that people started noticing she was missing, and they called her house and Matlick answered and two different people gave varying stories about where she was. Did he say Matlock residents? Right? I mean I mean resident. So here's a couple of pinky details. Matt Matt like I think was the guy, although he disagreed. Uh he um. Well, the people on the original flight, like the flight crew said, Now, she was never on this plane to begin with. Oh, from the Mayo Clinic back to Chicago. Yeah, okay, so that stands out as super hinky. Well he wasn't there, then he was going to pick her up in Chicago. He wouldn't have been in Minneapolis. So if she wasn't on the flight from Minneapolis to Chicago, he wouldn't have had anything to do with that, seemingly, but he Why would he say that he picked her up if she didn't arrive. I'm not saying he didn't know what happened, but I don't think he was the one that killed her. Sorry, just go well, he he cashed. He was found out later to have cashed thirteen grand and checks with the Fords signature from It wasn't his handwriting and it wasn't hers, that's right, but he's clearly working with someone. Sure, that's where I'm going here. Uh. And her brother Charles Voor he's that and Matt like actually burned her diaries after she died, and there's super weird. Well, her brother's explanation was that she was into automatic writing, which is basically where you get a piece of paper and a pen. Super Victorian, right, and um, you say, oh, spirits speak through me. Oh excellent airbag. Let's see what you got, right, and you just start the spirits move your hand. And her brother said, uh, she would not have wanted people to see this stuff, so we just burned it. It's like the weg Wegia writing. Right, It's exactly like that, except with a pen. Interesting. So they were just embarrassed and didn't want that to get out, that's what he said. Well, I mean, it's not a crime to destroy your papers. A lot of people made the case that um uh, Mark Twain should have destroyed his papers rather than allowing them to be published posthumously. I thought you were gonna say Mark Twain got rid of got rid of her, But that's impossible. It is in nineteen seventy seven. It is impossible. You imagine Twain in the seventies. I think it would have been much the same. Yeah, yeah, whimsical musings, yea with a searsucker suit, sharp, sharp wit, you know, yeah, with the series, Yeah, he would have been Tom Wolfe. So there's another guy named Richard Bailey who was a vacuum salesman. Apparently he was sort of like dirty rotten scoundrels. He would swindle old ladies out of their dough. I think it's more like American gigolo. Uh. Well, no, I don't think he was jigglowing. I think he was. Oh he was. Oh, I thought it just had to do with horses. That was his. Like, invest in this thoroughbread, give me your dough, but also come and lie down with me this in the sock, in my jeans. You know that's a gigolo thing to say. Uh. So he was eventually pinched for fraud and racketeering, sentenced to prison. Um and people thought that he had a role in her disappearance. He said, no, I didn't. And a judge said, do you know what I think you did? And he said, who cares what you think? Judge? Well, the judge said, well, I'll tell you why you should care, because I'm giving you a thirty years sentence because I suspect that you had something to do with Mrs Brock's disappearance and likely death. So who do you think it was him? I do Although he wrote a book, um, that said he loved her, that he yes, he was a jigglo, just a jigglo, but he fell in love with her and his love was sincere and real. Um. And he said that he was going to give the proceeds from his book to her favorite charity, which is an animal welfare charity. And she had her own foundation that she endowed upon her death, and she was declared dead seven years later in nineteen eighty four, just because that's what they do when you don't turn up for seven years and people think you're dead, um. And her her endowment basically went toward almost exclusively animal welfare. Well, he had already stolen all of her money when he killed her, right, Well, that was the thing. So we sold her some bumb racehorses for three grand and they later sold for one dollar. That's how bad off these race horses were. He said, by Limp Joe, he's a great investment. And the one eyed Pete and they they think that he had her whacked because um, she was going to blow the whistle on him. Interesting, Yeah, that's the theory, right, and I mean he's in prison for it right now. He's not in prison for her murder, although the judge just said, like, yeah, I gave you a stiff sentence because I think you killed her, kind of like when O. J. Was sent in to prison for armed robbery, yeah, and kidnapping and yeah, all these other things. I think it's the exact same thing watching that show right now. Now, I'm waiting until it's done and then I'll start it. Terrible, well, terribly awesome. Oh okay, cool, Yeah, I like that. However, I think I'm bailing on it because after a few episodes that was the novelty of it being terribly awesome kind of war off and I'm like, I just don't know if I have time to watch something that's good, bad or bad. I think you don't like it's too short, you know, I like it, though, you never know. I'll try it for sure. It's bad casting. Cubic Gooding Jr. Is he not a good O J. Well, he's just he's too nice. He's just small, like he doesn't look like a football player. Even though he played one Jerry McGuire, Yeah, he did. He played a wide receiver though, what was he He's a running back, was he? Yeah? You gotta be a little stock here and that bigger and boy Malcolm Jamal Warner is a c and he's way over the top. Yeah, but it's worth it for just to watch Travolta. It's that's something else he plays. Robert Shapiro, right, Oh does he? I can't wait to see this now, man. Yeah, it's you should definitely check out of psych the first one at least. Well, since we're so psyched, we should take another break. What do you think let's do it? Okay, how about a quick one. George Washington's teeth Yeah, here today, gone tomorrow. Yeah. So they were in a storage room at the Smithsonian. They were on loan in uh from since nine from the University of Maryland dental school. Right. Yeah. Washington had terrible teeth, like me. That's his like that was his cross to bear in his life. By the time he was inaugurated, he only had one tooth remaining, so he very famously had full dentures in his mouth. Uh. And the providence of those dentures is up for debate. They're clearly not they're not wood or wooden teeth. That's an old wives sale. But there's things like ivory um gold, real human, real human teeth. And that's where like the debate comes up because some people are like, he these were forcibly taken from his slaves, and other people are like, they might be slave teeth, but he probably bought them. If you really look at his character over the course of his lifetime, he most likely wouldn't have had his teeth his slaves teeth forcibly extracted. He probably would have compensated for and if you look at contemporary ads at the time, that was a common practice to buy teeth from people who are willing to give him up. Although I'm quite sure that somewhere in the US dentures were made out of forcibly extracted slaves, which is like one of the most horrific things I've ever heard of. So in the end, Washington ended up having four. They're well, probably more than four, but there are four existing sets left on display, and one of which was at the Smithsonian until they disappeared um from storage room where only employees had access, so it double locked stories. Yeah, it very much. Is seems like an inside job almost invariably. But it gets a little more interesting because half of them showed back up. Yeah, the lower the lower half, I think, leave those the lower half. Yeah, like a year later, they just suddenly reappeared out of nowhere, and they think that, Um, rather than sell these on the market to somebody like Steven Spielberg or something, they they they melted them down for their gold, which is terrible. You know, that's I'd rather have some rich jerk have the full set and just know that they're out there still, then have them melted down for gold. Right. They're like, you can get that anywhere? Um, that would be very sad. Indeed. Uh. And to this day, they still don't know where those the top set. I'm sorry the Yeah, the top set remains missing. Yeah, it might be someone's wedding ring right now. Wouldn't that be weird? That would be really weird, you know. Yeah, Flight nineteen. Are we moving on? Yeah? I love this one. We covered this one a little bit in their Bermuda Triangle episode. Yeah, I remember not liking that episode for some reason. I don't know, I don't know. It was basically like, look at all this hokum. Yeah. Yeah, we spent the whole time explaining why that it's not a real thing. Okay, well maybe I did like it then, Oh yeah, yeah, because it's not a real thing. No, it's not. There's not some mistake. There has been a lot of weird disappearances in that area. That's indisputed, indisputable. Don't even try Flight nineteen in December nineteen forty five, there were five planes TBM Avengers, which are torpedo bombers. They took off from Fort Lauderdale on a training mission. Uh supposed to be a couple of hours. Don't go more than a hundred and fifty miles, guys, and uh, just come on back and we'll have some hot soup waiting on you, right, or maybe it's Fort Lauderdale, some good spato, yeah, or Cuban black bean suit maybe oh yeah. Yeah. But they never came back, No, they didn't. Um and back back in Fort Lauderdale. I think at the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood Airport, which is what it is now. Back then it was like Fort Lauderdale, right, Um, the they were waiting anxiously for him, and and they never came back, although they did get a radio transmission from the guy who was the trainer, Yeah, the flight leader. He said, both my compasses are out for some reason, and we are in big trouble. We have no idea where we are. And they went back and forth with the tower for a while trying to figure out where they were. Uh, and they changed courses a few times. Then that was the last anybody heard of him. Yeah. So they sent a plane after them, a Mariner aircraft with thirteen men aboard. So they already lost fourteen, I believe, from these other flights, five planes, and then they sent another plane, right, said, another plane. That one didn't come back. People need a triangle. Well, that one's no big mystery. They attributed that to an explosion, so they think it actually exploded, and well what man, it explode aliens, But it didn't seriously disappear, Okay. The other ones definitely did mysteriously disappear, and um they most people thought that they just went um further and further out into the Atlantic. That at one point they were over the Bahamas or Bermuda, which they mistook for the Florida Keys, which is not the same thing. And if you use that mistakenly, as your bearings, you're going to be in big trouble, and that they ended up just running out of feeling crashed in the Atlantic. But uh, in the last year or two, a couple of independent searchers who had this same theory independently came together and said, you know what, there was in nine a Broward County Sheriff's Department helicopter spotted the wreckage of one of these planes, the TBM Avenger, in the Everglades, next to Jimmy Hoffa's body, and um, they said, it was so far off from where they thought flight nineteen had been that it couldn't have been one of them. And then they went back and looked at the records and they were like, well, the only missing Avenger planes are from flight nineteen, so it has to be one of them, basically, And they found an aircraft carrier off of Daytona had tracked six unidentified planes that night turning into the Florida mainland, so they think rather than going out to see they turned inland and didn't realize they were inland because the weather was so bad. They were way off course right, and they at least one of them crashed in the Everglades. Yeah. Um. The only thing I knew about this previous to this research was the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Oh really they showed up in that, Yeah, I remember that was Um. I never saw the whole thing. Oh man, it still holds up. Yeah, like Spielberg knows what he's doing. Yeah. And the special effects even still look pretty decent considering you know what what we're how long ago it was, Um, they found the planes and the desert. Uh. And the idea was that the aliens had had gotten ahold of the guys because at the end of the movie, the big mothership lands and they lowered the thing and George Clinton comes out, not George Clinton, but all these people come out, and um, people again abducted over the years, and the cruise of the Flight nineteen came out still the same age as when they disappeared in their flight uniforms. And they were like, wow, that was weird. They're like, what a night And then they went, oh my god, it's Richard Dreyfus. I love Jaws. Yeah, I didn't say that. I watched a little bit of it. Was that any good? Did you watch it? And I didn't catch my attention. Yeah, I did watch Jaws again the other night for like the eightieth time. That's an all time. That'll be great a hundred years from now, and I can watch it every single time. I get right back into it. Amazing. Uh, Mary Celeste, I thought we had covered this, but we haven't. No, this doesn't isn't super mysterious to me. What do you think happened? Well, here's the backstory in case there's anyone on earth that doesn't know about the ghost ship. Uh. It was UM in eighteen seventy two, in December UM there was a British vessel about four hundred miles east of the Azores Islands, thousand miles west of Portugal, and they saw this ship, the Mary Celeste, and they went, oh, my god, look at that ship. We know that ship. Let's go over to it and say hello. But there was nobody on board, and they knew that it shouldn't be where it was and that there's something up because the crew that spotted it the um what is it the day? Would you pronounce the E and the I? Uh, I'd pronounced that the de Garrazia. Oh nice, okay, but it's a British vessel so that's probably wrong, so okay, but still they could have it named like that, you know. So the de Garrazia UM said, well, this Mary Celeste left eight days ahead of us, it should be like all the way to Jenoa basically by now, and it shouldn't be there. And when they looked, there was no one on board. But there wasn't any obvious reason for there to be no one on board. There was a ghost ship, which is awesome in and of itself. I mean, it is fairly mysterious UM because is well here here's some of the facts. There were seventeen hundred and one barrels of industrial alcohol on board UM. Only nine were empty because there was one theory that the crew got drunk and they an industrial alcohol industrial alcohol, and UM had a mutiny, right, But that doesn't hold up. It's not a likely story. Now they think the nine barrels UM they were made of a different kind of oak than all the others, and it was a leaky oak, so they say it probably just leaked out what else, food and water? They had plenty of it still on board, six months worth left on board UM. And I think a woman named Mary Thorogood created a documentary about this and really like investigated it, and um, these are mostly her findings and they're pretty recent. But um, one of the one of the big weird mysteries that the lifeboat was gone right, kind of weird. I think that's because they got on it and left. There was a pump disassembled and there's a little bit of water. But upon inspection, the Dea Gratia found like, no, those things totally seaworthy. She can make it all the way to Genoa and we'll even tow her. And they towed her to Portugal, I believe, right. Yeah, But here's the thing. Apparently the whole where the flooding was was so crowded that the captain, Benjamin Spooner Briggs, couldn't get down there. He said he didn't know how much water. So one of the theories is that he thought they had taken on way more water than they had and his family was on board, including a little two year old daughter, and he said, uh no, let's just get the heck out of here. I'm not taking any chances, which was a big chance that didn't pay off in and of itself. Yeah, but the abandoned ship is a lass resort like, you don't just say, oh, I think we might be in trouble, let's get on out of here on the one lifeboat for all of us, and yeah, in the middle of the Atlantic. That's not yeah, no, you're not going to do that. What do you think happened. I think that that's what happened. I think that he thought they had taken on way more water, he had his family aboard, I saw they had just been through a bad store arm and he saw the mainland with his own eyeballs and said, this is our chance. Let's not screw around here. I don't want to sink with mainland and insight. But the thing is that the mainland wasn't insight. The Azores are like in the middle of nowhere. They're like halfway between the Atlanta between Europe and um North America. Well that's where they found it eventually. But supposedly he saw the mainland oh yeah, And I think so. And that's why I think that he just said, all right, it's time to go. So there's long been a suspicion that the crew of the day Grazia were the ones who did away with the crew of the mart The last wouldn't it go ship when we found it. Right. So the reason they would have done this is because under maritime law, if you find a ship that's insured, the insurer has to pay you a salvage feeds insured amount, which they did. They did, but they only got one sixth of the insured amount, which suggests that the British Maritime Admiralty Court believed that they were crooked, that they'd done something to the Mary Celeste. We shall never know, no unsolved mystery. Yeah. In fact, I was gonna say we should do an episode on that and full but um, I think maybe we should just refer people this stuff he missed in history class, because they did a great episode on that. Yes, Mary Celeste. So we got one more chuck. Alrighty, this might be my favorite one of all. I had never heard of this, uh pro basketball player who disappeared without a trace. I had neither. His name is John Brisker, right, that's right. He's from Detroit, and he went to your University of Toledo. Actually go uh rockets, Rockets. And the thing is while he was at YOUTU, apparently he had had a racially harmonious upbringing in Detroit and got to Toledo and experienced racism firsthand and grew up fairly bitter from it. He was um uh he He had a reputation of having a short fuse after that point, which he didn't have before growing up. Yeah. He went on to play pro ball with the A B A the Pittsburgh Condors, and then eventually Um made his way to Seattle with the SuperSonics, and he was good too. With the Condors. Over three years, he averaged twenty six points a game the first year. It was the second and third years it was about thirty points a game for the year. That's a that's amazing even for the A B A. Um, I'm not knocking to A B A. They were great. Actually, was there an Atlanta team in the A B A. No, it was always NBA. Where did Atlanta get its team from from? Why do I want to say Milwaukee? That was the Braves, jeesu, I can't remember. And the Thrashers were the Flames right. Well, now we had the Flames and they just went away, and then we created the Thrashers and Flames went out. They went out. Now the tough The Thrashers went to Canada or something. Yeah, they went to a different city. Uh, don't have hockey in Atlanta. I think we've learned our lesson not There's a lot of transplants, but apparently not enough. So back to Brisker, he Um eventually played for the Sonics. After that he said, I'm gonna open a restaurant that failed, and then in night he said, you know what, I'm going to Africa and I'm gonna open an import export business. Yeah, but he he wasn't just going to Africa. He went to Africa under the invitation of the Ugandan dictator Idi A mean who loved basketball. Loved basketball, and I guess I'd heard of John Brisker, and John Brisker said, sure, man, let's uh, let's hang out kind of like Rodman with Um Kim Jong Un. Yeah, and uh he went and hung out with the d I mean definitely Um. And I guess about six weeks after he made it to Uganda, he placed a call to his girlfriend and the mother of one of his children, Um Melvis Diane Williamson, right, and he said, hey, baby, we are going to get back together. I'm gonna have you guys come over here soon. I'm just laying the foundation. It's all good. I'll see you guys, I'll call you in a little bit. And now is the last anybody ever heard from him? Yeah, and there, Um, there are many theories on this one. One is uh well, I mean figures in a couple of ways. One is that maybe he ran a foul of I mean and was killed by uh, he and his soldiers. The other is that he was killed by anti I mean revolutionaries because he was pals with I mean and he was there when the Immane regime was top old, like that's when he was there. Uh. And another one that I don't think it's true at all is that he eventually made his way to uh to Jonestown and was part of the Jonestown Jim Jones suicide people. That one actually has more legs than it appears at first. He had a great aunt who was there who tried to get him and other family members to come join her in Jonestown. All right, So we'll give that up. So it's like not just totally random. Yeah, you know, um, but that's probably probably didn't happen. I think they can't find any real evidence that happened. His brother Ralph said up until he was declared dead, and um, I think nine five, His brother Ralph held the idea that his brother had just assumed another identity to get away from debt because he had like twenty grand and taxes just from that restaurant alone. Um, that used to be a viable option in life. You could just like you, did we ever do a show on that? Yeah? Okay, that was a long time ago. That one might need a dusting off, But it's I think the answer now is no, you can't. Yeah, exactly is that it? Sir? I think that's it. Man, unsolved mysteries that may stay unsolved forever. We're Roberts Stack, thank you for joining us. Or wait, I'll be Dennis Freena, You be Robert Stack, got breast his soul, both their souls. Freena is dead now it stinks. He's one of my faves.
