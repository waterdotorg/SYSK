Josh: Welcome to stuff you should know front House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w. Chuck Bryant. Jerry's over there too, So this is you should know. How you doing come fine? How are you doing good? You know this one? Um, we did a podcast in June twelve, Should we have a fat tax? Sure? I remember that was now that I look at the timeline of uh and I'm sure we'll cover this now about Mayor Bloomberg in New York in twelve. That was in May when he wanted to ban the sale of soft drinks over sixteen ounces in New York City. Uh. And we released in June twelve, So that had to have been the impetus, right, Uh, baby, it was probably something to do with it. But the difference with his two thousand and twelve push was that, um, he was just trying to ban it. There was no tax. It was correct. You can't have this tubs, you know, Yeah, like you're drinking yourself to an early death with the sodas. There's that very famous commercial that he had where like this this uh, very large man is drinking like a big gulp and Michael Bloomberg steps into the frame, smacks it out of the guy's hand, shoves him, turns to the camera and smiles, and he's missing a front tooth. What I'm just kidding. It's pretty believable, though. I was with you until the tooth part, and then it was like, what kind of monster would be missing in front tooth at h uh? Yeah, so, um Bloomberg did try to ban that, which, like you said, is different than a than a syntax. But um, yeah, by the way, we're not saying s Y and T a X. It's high end space T A X. That's right. And this article paints, uh, one of the broadest political brushes I've seen from our articles in a long time with this sentence. Syntaxes are often considered a favorite tool of liberals out to impose a nanny state on freethinking individuals. Conservatives often to post syntaxes on the grounds that they amount to greater government intervention in people's lives. Now, let's all read some iron ran It's it was just a pretty like it wasn't nuanced. No, it's pretty pretty unnuanced. Remember those big plastic bats that you would get with the whiffleball when you're like two, so you're learning to practice baseball. It's like being hit with one of those. Yeah, there's no mistaking it. It's just weird one of our articles because I think that's sort of the the old party line that people believe. It's just like all liberals just want to do is control your life. Well, I think the author very clearly sees it that way and slipped it in. I guess yeah, But he also slipped in, but not all liberals think this way because John Stewart thought it was ridiculous. Than that, it's kind of funny. I don't remember John Stewart doing that. Um do you do you remember him coming out against it? I don't remember, but that doesn't surprise me. He said it was draconian and would not have the proper outcome. And John Stewart's pretty smart guy. Well yeah, if he thinks that, then I do so he's probably one too, and we'll talk a lot about this. But syntax is uh to me. The proposed outcome isn't necessarily like what um ends up happening A and maybe not even what they're after in the long run. Jerry's still out on that you know, like you talked to some people and say, oh, no, they're effective. Other people say no, they're not effective, and some people say sometimes they're effective. I think the third group is probably right. Yeah, sometimes, so we should probably tell people which talking about with a syntax. Syntax is a type of text that is levied against a usually a good of some sort that society in general says, we don't really think you should have too much of that. As a matter of fact, we'd all be happier if you would not use that. So we're going to have our government, or go along with our government levying a text. Yes, the next size text, which is a sales tax on one specific type of good. Um. For example, with a syntax something like tobacco or liquor or gambling, something that society tends to think of as advice. Yeah, and so they're saying, there's a couple of things that are being said. With the syntax, it's saying, well, we want you to stop, so we're gonna hit you in your pocketbook. Yeah, that's a good argument. You can argue both ways. Um. And then secondly, and I think this one's a little more legitimate. Um, that is costing the rest of us money in the form of higher insurance rates, Like you're abusing your body, we're having to pay for community hospitals. That cost of society. Yeah, there's a cost of society. So if you want to do this to yourself, you're gonna have to pay more for it, so that we can use that money for things like health care systems to fund UM, to fund this, to offset the social cost that you are creating. Yeah, And a lot of times there is something specifically earmarked for a specific syntax, like we're gonna take the money in our state from this new cigarette tax and put it toward this healthcare measure. UM. And I think that they like to do that more because people might get behind it more if they're not, just like it'll just go in the government coffers And uh, I don't know how much faith there is the public at large that the government spends the money wisely. Well, that's that's I mean, that's a big part of it. Like if you are not taking the money from a syntax and directly using it to offset the social cost of whatever that vices or whatever, if there is one, UM, then you're scamming the general populace and you're using your shaming like a segment of your populace for that, for that to that end to scam everybody. Yeah, or which is not cool. Let's let's say you're not, um, want to drink soda much, but every once in a while you like to get out there and have a big, tall, giant, big gulp. Then you're paying that tax. And some people might say, well, that's not really fair because you're not contributing to any social epidemics. Right. Um, we're gonna get into all this, but we should point out that Bloomberg, um, he lost that war. He uh, the soda industry they you know, they're not just gonna say that sounds like a great idea, mayor. They fought hard. They mounted a campaign and ad campaign, they mounted a legal challenge, and the Court of Appeals eventually struck it down in June. So later that year he said, all right, New Yorkers, you don't like to be pushed around, Let's go to Berkeley, California. Yeah. Well, okay, So Bloomberg is a billionaire, right sure, And he's a billionaire who is exceedingly liberal. He's a very liberal billionaire. Um, and he his foundation in two thousand and ten and said we're going after soda. We've not just we the Bloomberg Group, but the World Health Organization said soda texas probably the most effective strategy of government can undertake for improving the diet of the general population. UM, there's mounting evidence that what are called ss D s sb's sugar sweetened beverages are they lead to increased weight gain and other um co morbid health outcomes like diabetes and are basically they're they're becoming the central focus of a lot of um negative publicity. A lot of people are saying these things are are around the nexus of a lot of really bad chronic health conditions. It's these sodas right, and so much so that there was this really great Guardian article that was written by Tina Rosenberg and she puts it, soda is on the verge of becoming the liquid cigarette. And in part because of Bloomberg and his his foundation, what would that make the East cigarette? East cigarette is the new cigar? Uh? Yeah, soda is one that it's easy to go after because UM, childhood obesity and kids that you about stories about kids like going through like a leader or a two leader of sugary sweet soda a day in these you know, just ridiculous amounts of sugar intake that any reasonable person would say, like, you can't drink that much sugar right well and expect to like not have like huge consequences. The UK has a sugar text on the books that's proposed to take effect next year, and I was reading a BBC article on it and they had like this little pole thing comparison thirty five grams of sugar and a can of Coca cola. Thirty grams is the maximum that the UK suggests it's children or people eleven years or older have a day. And so if you drink one cannon coke, you're automatically having more then you're supposed to have in one day as far as like a normal diets concerned and who just drinks one can of coke? You know, Well, so what we're do you really Well, I don't even drink and we've talked about this before. I rarely ever drink soda, that's true. You're drinking water right now, yeah, And it's just it's not an effort to not drink sugar water. It's just sort of the way I was raised. We didn't have a lot of sodas in the house, drank a lot of water. I still love water. It's good stuff, that's right, it is. And as a sweater too, that's what I need water. Yeah, so I can sweat more. It's just a system. It's called the closed loop. He's swallowing. Yeah. Uh so, I feel like about eight minutes ago, I said something about going to Berkeley. Um. So Bloomberg went to Berkeley later in fourteen after he was rebuffed in New York and said, New Yorkers don't like to be shoved around. Let's go out west where all these Berkeley hippies will surely be down with this kind of thing. And let's uh, instead of trying to ban it, let's try and get a syntax an exercise tax i pose and uh. He was very successful there. There was um. Obviously, the the uh soda industry they're tried to fight back as well, to the tune of about close to two million bucks uh in a campaign against it, But voters said, yes, we like the syntax uh, to the tune of how much is it a penny? An an ounce ye that could be substantial. Coke used to be what like a dollar. I don't even know now, it would be a dollar twenty, that's right, you know, I mean, yeah, that could be substantial, especially if you're talking two leader, three leader. It's getting into the area where you would start to see an impact from it. Yeah, that's the way to do it. Though, I gotta say, instead of just like you know, a flat tax across the board, they're literally saying, like, the more you drink of this stuff, the more you will pay. Right, It's a negative. It's a disincentive to buy that product, which again society or the government or somebody has deemed unhealthy. Right, And in that case, uh, in Berkeley at least, you know that what they need to do is look at this stuff long term. But in the short term, um, over five months after the tax, they saw that, um this is the American Journal of Public Health. They found that low income and minority residents of Berkeley drink less soda than before, but in San Francisco nearby consumption went up by four percent. That's a pretty significant study. Yeah, five months though, Like, well, that's the problem. Like, look at it long term, I think is what the because maybe initially people will stop and then they'll go back to it. Maybe right, But why did San Francisco's go up for people like leaving Berkeley to go get their soda thicks? Maybe, I mean, that's entirely possible. I don't know. I don't think you would. The money you would spend going back and forth to San Francisco is unless you just went and bought like a truckload of cases of soda. Yeah. If that's the case, then you got you know, there are other issues in your life. Consider like even just the people who live near the border close enough. Yeah, where on the way home they're stopping or during their day they're stopping in San Francisco, just on the border getting a coke. That would raise consumption in San Francisco. Uh, Coke and the other companies might say, hey, um, we need to divert all the stock that was gonna go to Berkeley over to San Francisco and maybe spend a little more on advertising there. I could raise consumption. I guess so. But you make a very valid point. I'm not disagreeing with you. That jury is very much still out on whether soda taxes actually do work in the long term, And then even more is we'll see whether they have the impact and effects that are supposedly desired. Yeah, well, let's take a little breather and we will go uh huddle, not puddle, huddle, huddle, pittle from all all the water we've been thinking. Uh, people say that about their dogs, like he pittled. I think that's just a cute way of saying he beat it right, takes a stay out of it a bit a little. But also I think the peddle. I think a pile is just a little squirt. Yes, but it's usually also a company with like a I'm nervous or I'm scared or something, so I'm peddling. Well that's a weird segue. So we'll go uh pittle and talk about a little history of this when we get back. All Right, we both got excited the book Pittle piddle a little bit. Jerry mopped it up, piddled it a little. Yeah, she was so um scornful though. Yeah, that's all right. Uh, alright, so history WI, this is nothing new, And this is a stat that I didn't know for about fifty years in the late eighteen hundreds to early nineteen hundreds, until n of our revenue in the United States came from taxing booze and beer, smokes wine. I feel like we talked about then in the customs episode tariffs episode. Did we do a tariff episode? We talked about tariffs in customs. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that it's a large share of your taxes though, coming from syntax, right. And as a matter of fact, the first tax on a domestic product levied by the United States was on It was a syntax. It was a tax on whiskey or on distilled liquor, the famous whiskey tax that led to the even famous for whiskey rebellion, which led even famous her to the Whiskey Hangover Whiskey Rebellion hangover. Uh So, in nineteen thirteen, that all change when the United States said, you know what we should do. We should people are making money now, we should tax their income because the more they make, the more successful they are, the more that we can get until they get to a point where they can get away from paying taxes. Sure they're so rich, and people, wait, how does that work? They went, Oh, you wait, they said, forget the supply side, We'll go to the demand side to tax. And from that moment on, the United States never collected a scent in Texas from another company. Again the end so um. But the point is syntaxas are most major source of government revenue up until right, which is a little ironic, I guess considering our history as a country. Yeah, it is. But what's weird is it's it's the syntax actually goes back really far. There's a lot of governments and throughout history that have collected syntaxes um, for all sorts of different reasons. Um. And then they also used to take the form of something called sumptuary laws. Yes, so sumptuary laws were basically rather than taxing. It was kind of like what Bloomberg was trying to do by just outlowing outlowing so it all together, but rather than necessarily being a moral thing, usually sumptuary laws were meant to keep class distinctions intact. Yeah, like you know, the word sumptuous expensive looking. It was a way to restrain extravagance. Um. And like you said, uh, And they use Elizabeth the First in this article, which was a good example because she was big on those. And you know, it's kind of like I don't want how am I going to tell the difference between my subjects if they're dressing all fancy now and thinking they're all that. Yeah, I don't want to accidentally talk to a commoner pretty much. Uh, And I looked into these a little bit. Apparently they were not very ready enforced. Um. If they were, it was usually because of a specific complaint that someone would bring against, like their neighbor or something. They're wearing fancy shoes. Yeah, pretty much. It wasn't like super police. But they made a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Hey, that's just good old fashioned ingenuity. Um. When you open it, it it moves. But apparently that when these young men would enter London, they would sometimes their swords would be measured, and if their swords were too long, they would break them because that was a sign of extravagance. If you had some big, flashy sword. It's not a euphemism, right, you're talking about a sword. I don't think, so weird and gross. So even in this country, the sumptuary laws um almost made an appearance. I think in the puritan Um codes there may have been some sumptory laws, but in the Ated States itself, George Mason during the Constitutional Convention said, hey, let's get some sumptuary laws. They've been done for centuries already, they work. Let's just keep it going. But Mason's aim wasn't to um keep class distinctions. He wanted to basically say, hey, here's how you guys conduct yourselves the way we say where the US government. Don't flashy because don't be flashy, don't be um, don't waste your money, don't drink too much. So so rather than saying like we're going to tax your whiskey, you who produced whiskey, We'll just go and say you, you know, you, member of the public, you can only have like a pine of whiskey a day, and anything beyond that you will throw you in jail for That would be a sumptuary law. But the the other guys in the Constitutional Convention said no, no, no, no. I think one of them very famously said, um, the law of necessity is the greatest sumptuary law. Meaning if you tax people, they're not going to be able to afford it anyway. Plus you, the government, get the money, So why be a jerk and just outlaw it. Just throw a big old tax on it, and everybody wins except for the poor loser he's having to cough up this much more stuff to to kill himself. Yeah, forget laws up with taxes which had been you know, like we talked about a long history and in the seventeen sixty four we uh, we're subject to a sugar tax, which kind of had a twofold purpose. One was, Hey, anything that we can do to make the king richer great, uh and be you know, we know what you're doing with that sugar. You're making rum and you're getting too drunk, and we don't like that either. So instead of a sumptuary law there, let me just tax your sugar. And do you remember we talked about swilling the planters with bumbo? Yeah, like that was just election day. People used to drink in the United States. Yeah, not like now, No, not like now. I know I was being facetious, but that is true. People like everyone was drunk back then. Yeah, there was written no reason not to be. No, it was a hard life for everybody. You weren't driving around, no, you were you were in like weird pants. Yeah, there's a lot to You had a lot of reason to drink. Yeah, you could just get on your horse, and your horse knows where to go, skipper, skipper knows where to go it was a weird neighbor hors. So do these syntaxis actually work? Is the question? Well, yeah, that is the big question. So um, oh we don't know, you. I mean, it can work for sure. We actually with with this is I thought this was a very Um this article confused me here there because it seemed to be making its own argument rather than reporting the arguments, which I found like hard to follow. And then secondly it just kind of wove all over the place right as far as that argument went. But I think what I'm getting is with the soda tax, that specific kind of syntax, which is the syntax doujure of the century right now. Um, and I've just said the syntax of the day of the century, which is a little weird. Um, the jury is very much still out like a few countries of tax soda, but they also tax like mineral water and diet soda. So there's no way to study whether that actually works. As far as like health outcomes and things. Yeah, I mean there's a few different ways to say whether or not it works, because there's threefold It's like, can we improve health outcome, can we raise money? Yes, in that case it always works. Right, and UM and C or three started with three p o um man, this is falling off the rail. Uh and see does it help the public at large? UM. In the case of Mexico, they a couple of years ago imposed to soda tax um because Bloomberg spending ten million dollars. That surprised me, but that was a good place to do it because apparently, UM, Mexico was nuts for sugar sweetened beverages. Yeah, and sort of junkie food and sugary beverages. I think it has a reputation for sure as being a problem. And I think in two thousand and six there was like a nationwide health report basically like a study of Mexico and they were finding like it was on its way to becoming like the fattest country in the world. And UM they were like, well this, this is definitely opening our eyes. And that kind of planted the seed for Bloomberg's a group to come in and a few years later and spend ten million on a campaign against soda. I've seen I mean, have you been to Mexico. I've seen it, you know, in person, Like it was a notice. It was noticeable to me the amount of people drinking soda just right out there in front of people. They weren't even trying to hide it. I'm kidding of course. Um so is when I guess Bloomberg was successful there, they had to pay so per leader tax and an eight percent tax on junk food and apparently both of those consumption of both went down a lot because of that tax. Um. But like I said, so wait, there's one there's one thing that consumption can decrease as a result. Right, What they don't know is the long term health outcome, because that's just one thing that can lead to poor health in your future, is a sugary drink. Well, so that to me smacks of like soda industry like obfuscation, well in a way, but it's true. It is true. But apparently in Mexico, the battle that's being fought by the soda industry is, um, hey man, don't don't don't text us. That's that you got it all wrong. Text the cheeseburger people, get them. Uh, and the cheeseburger people like what we're standing over here being quiet the pork rind people right. Um No, they were saying, teach kids to like get out and exercise more it's calorie and calorie out right, So who cares if our drinks have high calorie Tell these little kids to get off their duffs and get out there and start playing the hopscots or something. The thing is is, um diet is more responsible for obesity than exercises. You can exercise with your heart's content, and if you don't change your diet, you're never gonna lose any weight. It's diet that that leads to a change in obesity. And again, obesity is kind of the central focus of this whole cluster of co more big chronic illnesses that include things like UM insulin resistance and type two diabetes UM. And if you can change the diet, then you can conceivably cut down on these chronic illnesses. And again the World Health Organization said, so to text is the best way to change the diet. So that's just being fought in Mexico right now, and and it's actually it's having an effect at least on a reduction and consumptions. Now, what you're saying is we have to wait and see whether that reduction and consumption has a reduction in things like obesity and has a positive impact on health outcomes, and if that's the case, then Mexico will probably change, will lead the way for the rest of the world because everybody's gonna start following suit after that. Well, here's the thing, though, let's look at uh. Let's look at alcohol. For instance, we've long text cigarettes and alcohol in this country to great effect or great revenues at least. Uh. In two thousand nine, Illinois, the state of Illinois said all the beer is gonna be one cent more per bottle, and each serving of liquor is going to be five cents more, Which I don't know what that means. Uh, like ounce and a half. I think an ounce and a half is a serving a liquor. So is that just for a drink? You're getting a bar showy, they're not slapping that on a bottle that you buy. I don't know'd be a lot of dough. I don't know. Maybe I don't know. I don't know that either. Well, let's think about it's a fifth. The fifth is like, um, instead be like a dollar twenty extra for a fifth because it's a leaders about thirty two ounces, So three quarters of thirty two would be twenty four right, I'm pretty sure it is all right, sons, and maybe it wasn't that much then. Um. But what they found out was that deaths and this is where the hanky reporting comes in, UM, deaths associated with drunken driving stop by and the general population in thirty seven, it for young people and also went down for uh, people who drink a lot supposedly Yeah, heavy drinkers. Yeah, a population that that Everyone was like, that's the what you can tax it till the cows come home and they're still gonna drink. So that was drunk driving accidents. And UM, if you're someone like mathematics professor Rebecca Golden, UM, you will look at that and say that doesn't prove anything. That's correlation at best, and you can't prove that that caused the drop in drunken driving accidents. Well, she actually said also that there was a larger trend of um, drinking less. You know that it had to do with the Great Recession of two eight. People had less money to spend on drinking, so we're getting drunk less, so we're dying in drunk driving accidents less. She said it didn't have anything to do with this tax, But if you want to support the tax, you can cherry pick a study like this and say, well, look people, because this is the third part of that equation, the public at large benefit, which is fewer drunk driving accidents, um, less domestic abuse in the case of smoking, less second hand smoke issues. Um. That's when people are like, wait a minute, I'm the one smoking, doesn't affect anyone else, Well, yeah, second hand smoke, or I'm the one drinking. Plus let me destroy my own body. Everybody likes a pretty smile, not meth mouth. That's the number one problem with meth. But the problem with that, I don't know if it's the study or the tax or what, but that Illinois tax on alcohol leading to fewer drunk driving deaths. That doesn't mean that it couldn't work. I think I said somewhere that like is about the minimum that you want to slap a syntax on before it starts to have, um, the outcomes that you're looking for. That's just nothing. Half a cent on a beer. No one's even gonna notice that, you know, five cents on a shot. No is going to notice that it just couldn't possibly have the kind of outcomes that that study concluded it had. Right, But that's not to say that it couldn't if the text were raised, right. And the thing is is there's a there's a sweet spot. There's a window where too low of attacks isn't gonna do anything, but too high of attack can have really negative outcomes too, And we'll talk about those right after this break, all right. So you tease the fact that there is a point in time when you're raising these taxes to try and get more and more people to say, all right, enough is enough. I'm not paying five dollars and eighty five cents and taxes taxes on a pack of smokes. Yeah, and that's I think how much they pay in New York these days, New York State if you buy a pack of smokes. I'm not sure how updated that is, but it's got to be around there, yeah, Because I mean cigarettes are like twelve bucks there. Yeah, they're like twelve dollars a pack. Wow, I know that's insane. I remember friends saying like, I'll never like, I'll quit smoking once they hit five dollars a pack? Did he? Because some people say that and they don't know other people do. Yeah, And like even if it's a two percent of smokers who say that actually do two percent reduction in smoking across the country. That's the size of the United States. That's significant. No agreed, But like I was saying them, there's that breaking point. And Canada saw it for real backfire wise in the early nineties, they were um increasing the taxes on cigarettes. It finally got to a point where it spawned a black market, and all of a sudden, people, I think it from the black market was one percent of sales, and just five years later it jumped up to And not only are they is it defeating itself, but they're not. They're not raising They're getting less money on taxes than they would have if they would have kept it more reasonable. Right, Like I think Arkansas ran into the exact same problem they had. Um they up the tax on cigarettes in two thou nine. They doubled their tax. Suddenly it was a dollar fifteen a pack, which was enough that they were expecting something like um eighties six million dollars in revenue from tobacco. And they had an earmarked for a specific health UH initiative, which is good but also bad when you're like, hey, we're gonna project this much money for this thing. Yeah. Not only did they um not make the eighties six million dollars that they were expecting to. They actually collected ten million less than they had the year before. Yeah, ta trombone, right right. And the reason why is because they jack the attacks up too much and they made it um in the interest of the smokers to go elsewhere, like just across state lines to buy their cigarettes, and a black market developed. So there is a window where syntax can work. But you can't go too low, and you can't go too high or else it's gonna not have the intended effects. Yeah, here's a few stats, um in the United States, apparently a couple of years ago, Uh, Rhode Island, Nevada, West Virginia, New Hampshire, and Delaware. We're led the nation in syntaxas um tobacco at seventeen billion for the country. I'll cohol six billion casinos five and a half billion Russinos, which I had never heard of. Made sense though, Russian sina Russian casina racinos, I guess it would be called because uh, you know, horse races are doll races with a casino right were you're you're betting on them, right, Yeah, but it also has a casino attached Oh is that what it is? I guess, like, we know you like to bet on the ponies, but why not throw some black check over here? Have you ever tried electronic binga uh? And then video gaming paramutual betting seven hundred million? So, uh, the United States brings in a lot of dough from these taxes. And one of the big arguments, um, that you're gonna hear politically is that or I guess not even politically is that, Uh it's a regressive tax, meaning attacks that uh infects a proportionately unfair segment of the poor population, right, which makes total sense because uh, syntax is an excise tax, and an excise taxes a sales tax, and sales taxes almost two to a single one affect the poor more than they affect the wealthy. Just because this matters more. Yeah, it's a er share of their income exactly, you know. Right, Well, we also should point out to there are texas like luxury taxes on it's sort of a syntax for the rich, a luxury tex Yeah, because you're like you text yachts at a higher rate or something like that. Sure, yeah, this is a different type of excise tax with the syntax you're especially with say like tobacco. Uh, studies show that poor people tend to smoke more cigarettes than the wealthy. So when you have an excise tax a syntax on tobacco, yeah, you're definitely instituting a regressive tax because it's being shouldered by the poor disproportionately in that they have less income, but also because they smoke more. So some people say tada, syntaxes are regressive. Other people would say, well, actually, let's take another look at this. You could say that that's a progressive tax because it's having exactly the kind of outcome you want to have by basically making it so that the people who smoked the most can afford it the least. So therefore people are going to stop smoking as much now though we have traped very clearly, and syntaxes are always in this realm anyway, but now we can't avoid it any longer. What you're talking about is the government deciding what what is good for you and what you should or shouldn't do, and they're doing it in a sneaky way, like we talked about in the PR episode when we release from Chicago. UM that kind of um paternal liberalism where the government's like, oh, you just listen to us, we'll we'll take care of you. We're not going to tell you what to do. We're just gonna make it so that you can't really afford to do what we don't want you to do any longer. Right, But as this article points out, it's sort of a kind of talking out both sides of their mouth because they bring in the US government brings in ninety billion dollars. I think that's the the US and states together. Okay, so federally in state wise billion dollars from syntaxes each year. That they use that money and UH kind of need it. Yeah I almost said need but it didn't depend on it about that sure, UM. And you know they they say like, we don't want you to do these things. We want you to smoke and drink less, but well just not completely though, because we still want to collect these taxes. Yeah. So that's why I like UM. I know the UK had a big, a big issue with UM some of their proposed UH syntaxes on alcohol. They had one that was a syntax and they also had a proposal I'm not sure where this went yet, but UM on minimum alcohol pricing and uh, they flat out said, um, or you know, most of the public flat out said, like, there's no way you can have that minimum pricing because that's clearly gonna affect poor people who drink drink cheap liquor and go to the store and get you know, Mr Boston Vodka and that Boston vodka and cheap anymore because there's a minimum pricing on it, and it's not gonna affect the fat cat who wants to go in there and get his uh, what's a nice vodka? Uh vodka? Hold on, grey Goose, it's not bad, Grey Goose. Sure, Belvedere, Exactly, they're not walking in their sweating some minimum price on vodka or probably the tax because they want their martini, right exactly, No, that's exactly right. So I read this article from it's called the Wages of Syntaxes from the Adam Smith Institute, Oh of all places, the capitalism, and they said, you know, they come out very obviously, very much on the side of saying syntaxes are ineffective, they don't produce the outcome you want, they're regressive, and um, anyone who's saying anything else is just fooling themselves. What they're doing is trying to collect revenue. Yeah, where are you following this? I'm very curious. I'm not gonna weigh in on it. Okay, I'm just staying neutral. I'm saying some people say this, some people say that, good for you. Jack Chuck just stays at home, Yeah, with his Tetos vodka. Actually I don't even drink vodka, but I do have Tito's in the house because you know, you want to offer it to your friends. It's American, that's right. Sure, Oh bloody marry I mean now and then oh yeah, although you got to drink that with Jenner tequila so much better than a vodka. Have you tried it? Yeah? And you prefer vodka? Is still huh absolutely really yep. I'm surprised to hear you say that. Yeah, Titos, uh Mr Boston not Mr make a blend of both two thirds Tito's, one third Mr Boston and then spit my friend. Well, I do have that famous bloody Mary recipe from years ago, the Caesar. But I've also been called out for not talking specifically about my red neck crabbed up. People are writing in saying you can't just say that they want the recipe. You can't say crack dip and not give us a recipe. So are you going to Well, I don't remember, Like I don't go I don't do recipes because I like to just cook by the seat of my pants. But I know it's got the k rab chopped up lemon juice, it's got mayonnaise, it's got Worcestershire little salt, pepper and paprika and that maybe it. I just don't remember the exact proportions. And you made you can monkey with it sure like like mayo, Yeah you do. You can go lighter on the mayo if you want, if you want to be a comie, um, Worcestershire. I don't remember putting a ton in there. Just yeah, a couple of couple of dashes or no tapoon. Well, I mean it depends on how much you're making. You know, if you make a big tub for a party, you're gonna want more than a couple of dashes, probably like you know, a quarter cup or something. Who um yeah right, yeah, uh, wake you up. And I think that's everything. Just as I say, monkey around with it, get creative, and then next week maybe I'll talk about my Bloody Caesar recipe. I think you should that. I didn't even know it's called the Bloody Caesar until recently. Again, I think it was the Bars episode. Yeah, because it became clamato and stead of tomato, that's the difference, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the clam makes all the differ. Do you like red beer or Jerry? What's at there? And called that? You had your michelada Michelada, love him? We call him red beer and yuma? Oh really? Yeah, that's funny because you was closer to Mexico than New York. You know, you think if anywhere they call him a Michelada. In fact, it's so close to Mexico you can walk there. Oh is it that g I didn't know humans on the border? Oh yeah, I mean it's it's right on the border of Arizona in California and uh in Mexico. It's like right in that bottom corner. Yeah. You know. The worst is um if you ever order a Michelloda somewhere and they don't they have the gall to not bring you the can of beer as well, Like you just made you a Michelada eight dollars please, and it's like there's a shot of beer, not even that because it's still kind of foamy, and they just try to pretend like they don't owe you that the rest of that beer, that that didn't get into the glass. At the same time, what kind of weirdness is this? It's not okay, So hold on, I'm of time. If you order a Michellodda and they don't bring you the can, you tell them to bring you the can, and then you throw that can back in their face. That's a little at the topic. Yeah, I guess you could, especially if you chug the rest all at once. Jerry did not care for her Michelloda that because it was um we saw the woman make it. It didn't have tomato juice. It was just made with like hot sauce. It's not supposed to have tomato juice, all right, So Jerry just weighed in. We took the tape off her mouth, right, and she said that in Guatemala they make the Michellodda with clamato. Well, that's what they did in Huma. That was a red beer, basically bloody mary with beer. So that is not that's different from Michellodda in my in my experience at the what's the Triple Crown horse race in Maryland. I don't know. So there's the Kentucky Derby, Yes, the Preakness. At the Preakness, they make something like Jerry was just describing where it's like, um, bloody Mary with beer. They didn't call it a michellotta what they call it. I don't remember what they called it. Kevin like it is good. I'll give you that. But my experience Mitchellott is lime juice, beer and hot sauce. Well that's what she got and you didn't like it, huh. Alright, so Josh says Jerry, she liked it. She said it was awful. The proportions were not correct, and she did we get charged for that. We did get charged for that, even though she didn't drink any of it. So I'm not going to name the restaurant in New York. You're not gonna shame him publicly, huh. I will say the lobster tacos were good. I'm sorry, the lobster roll was good. So that could be anywhere in New York. Was their crownut there as well? That'll be a slight hint, slight hint. Yeah, so you narrowed it down to three thousand places to the west village. Okay, alright, so that narrows it down. Okay. Uh so, Syn Texas, you got anything else? Uh? No, he said you didn't want to weigh in on it. I understand. I respect that. No, because you know, to be honest, not only do a not one a way in just because I'm trying not to do that. But um, you're turning over a new leaf. No. Just for things that I feel really passionately about, I will, but I don't feel super passionately about this. I'm being torn every which way by this. Well, that's what my deal is is. I don't I can't really speak to it because it's sometimes it seems like a regressive tax, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it seems like it might work, sometimes it seems like it might not. Right, So I think that's where I lie is ambivalent and confused. Yeah, I'm interested to see how this how this comes out, you know, with UM Berkeley, with Mexico, the Navajo Nation, UM instituted, they instituted a two percent junk food tax and then simultaneously repeal the five percent tax on fresh fruit and vegetables and their grocery stores. Yep. So there's a lot of like natural experiments going on right now that I'm very interested to see what the outcomes are. People are going to be audeing the heck out of those places. Well, there's a lot of natural experiments going on in my house to buddy. So if you if you want to know more about this kind of stuff, go and listen to our fat tax episode. We did want to high fruit toast corn syrup. There's a great article about syntax is that we used, called The Wages of Syntax as it was in the Atlantic by a guy named Band new Kirk. So go read that too. Brush up on the syntax tip. And since I said brush up, time for listener, Matt, I'm gonna call this Josh's choice. Every one boy, all right. Every once in a while Josh will send an email and saying, hey, I know this is your bag, that would you mind reading this one? And that is exactly what I wrote. Yeah, So this is uh from Ada, And I don't remember where Ada is from, but Ada is in high school, oh from Canada. So that immediately means that Ada is probably smarter than we are. She well, I mean the course she took in school is pretty impressive it is. I didn't run into those until well into college. All right, Hey guys, I'm seventeen year old from Canada, and somebody caught my attention to your Polar Bears episode when Josh is talking about hunting. Uh. He said that people will say, well, the food you're eating came from the store that was killed unethically as a counter argument, and Josh found it kind of fallacious, but didn't know how to describe it. Luckily, I'm taking the English class and we just finished finished a unit on fallacies, and I can confirm it is fallacious. So it would be qualified as a straw man argument because the counter argument isn't really arguing against your point that hunting is wrong, but it's arguing a slightly different and weaker point that food bought in grocery stores could be unethically killed, which takes your attention away from the point that you're arguing nice. It could also be an ad hominen to quoke sure that right? If my Latin not as rusty as I thought, to quoke q you o q u e u quake quoke quick quick, I didn't take Latin. I didn't need or you two y o U T O O not the band um. If you say that hunting is unethical killing, and then the person is saying, well, you participate in the unethical killing of animals by grocery shopping. Another example of this kind of argument be one person telling another that they shouldn't smoke, but the person says, well, you smoke. Just because the other person doesn't practice what they preach, it doesn't change the fact that it is wrong and good stuff. The reason that you might not have been able to identify this is because fallacies like this are used so much in media today and they're not accepted widely as fair arguments because they're really not. Hope this helped, Yes, yes it did. You were delighted keep calling out these fallacious arguments, and that is from Ada. Thank you Ada. That was de bravo. Although I have to say we did get some some good fallacious arguments on the other side. They had nothing to do with what I was saying necessarily, but they did explain hunting a little more, which I thought was pretty great, including one that you read. But we've gotten some other ones since then as well. There I'm just like, wow, I want to go hunting, like slap my own face. It was funny. I was at the park yesterday with my daughter and there were these really cool kids, his brother and sister that were probably ten and eight ish, and they were kind of hanging out. They had a dog that um that Ruby was playing with, and they were just being nice sounds talking to them, and then this other kid came up later and they were talking to these kids and they're talking about sports. This kid was saying he played baseball, the cool kid. I'm not saying your kid wasn't cool. And the other kids said, you know, I don't do any sports except for hunting and fishing. And this this other kid looked at him like he was from Mars. You could just see the difference in their two upbringing. And this kid was just like what. He's like, what do you hunt for? The kid was like deer, and he was like, you shoot deer? And he was still young enough in in that you know environment that his family is raising him in where he was just like, why would you shoot a deer? Right? Yeah, they're awesome. Yeah, And this gips like, yeah, man, that's pretty cool. It was an interesting interaction to watch as an adult. I would have liked to have seen that. Yeah, because I mean, and you have that conversation as an adult doesn't usually go that way. It'll go it's pretty interesting. Yeah, I've been listening in on kids convers just don't do it in a creepy way, you know, you know, they say everything you needed to know you learned in kindergarten. Yeah, I believe it. Uh Ada, Thank you again for that. That was a great email. Thank you too, Chuck for the additional anecdote. Sure beautiful.
