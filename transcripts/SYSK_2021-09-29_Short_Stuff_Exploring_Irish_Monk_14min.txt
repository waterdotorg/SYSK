Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh, there's Chuck. Dave's here in spirit. So that's a short stuff quorum. That's all you need. And this is short stuff. That's right, and we're here. We're here to dispel the rumor that Christopher Columbus discovered America. That's so old. That is pretty old. Are we really going to talk about that? No, No, we don't have to do that. That was definitely a two thousand eightish two thousand nine is kind of thing to say. But what are we going to dispel? Well, so I think one of the things we should at least say, because not everybody knows this is like the first Europeans definitively to reach North America. We're the Vikings. I know a lot of people know that, but not everybody knows that, Chuck. Not everybody knows that there's a Viking settlement that was discovered. I think they suspected for a long time because I think in the North Sagas they basically said, yeah, we made it to Newfoundland, um that the Vikings actually had made it to North America. And then finally in the sixties, I think they found a real deal bona fide, totally incontrovertible Viking settlement from about one thousand CE at a place called Lanceo Meadows, which I've always wanted to go to because I've always wanted to go to to Newfoundland for one, but to see like a Viking settlement in America would just that would be something else that would be great. We could go berserker, right, take a bunch of shrooms, get a battle axe. Yeah, and and then celebrate the fact that they were the very controvertibly, the very first Europeans to touch that soil. And that's I was gonna wrap up short stuff. You're right, there is a chance that the Vikings were even beat So the Vikings would have beat the age of exploration by about five hundred years. There's a theory, and it's got some legs conceivably that somebody else beat the Vikings by five years themselves, and that some sometime in about the sixth century showed up somewhere in North America. And who was that? Chuck the Oirish And I don't buy this, but I think it's a great story. You don't buy it, and now I think it is folklore. But we'll we'll talk about it anyway, because it is a fun story. But in the sixth century, as the story legend tail goes, St. Brendan was an Irish monk, very good sailor and seafair, uh very what saley saintly, saintly and saley. Yeah, supposedly undertook this this voyage, a joyous voyage of joyage, and with some fellow monks and went looking for paradise, the land of promise of the Saints, And after seven years came upon what he thought was this place, an island so vast that they did not reach the far shore after forty days of walking the head a river that was too wide to be crossed, a forested, wooded land with lush fruits, and he and the fellows filled their boats full of gems and returned home. So the Irish found it first, Yeah, And I mean, like, if you like he ain't talking about the Azores, you can definitely walk across them in forty days. There's not a lot of islands in between Ireland and North America, so it's really not clear. Uh you know what same Brendan was talking about where he went, and he wasn't like a dummy. He didn't accidentally stumble onto Europe like he sailed to Europe before. He was like a skilled navigator. So he is assumed as presumed to know have known enough that he knew what direction he was traveling in and that this really was like an all new place that that that his kind had never set foot in before. That's right. And in the ninth century, so several hundred years later, there was an this account, actual an account of this sir fist called Travels of St. Brendan Uh Navigatio sancti brendani magna carta master charge. If you take the bus, we all take the bus. Uh. It was a big hit. It was translated into a bunch of languages, and um, you know, it was the account of the journey. They are all sorts of crazy things in here, which, um, maybe we should save that for the second half because that's where it falls apart a bit with me. But should we talk a little bit about the vikings, uh, maybe lending some support to this idea? Sure? Yeah, Um, so the North have those sagas that I was talking about right where it's basically like we did this, this is neat, this is cool. Here's something else we did, and there's like a lot of um, there's a lot of uh like cre credulity to it, Like there's it's not just like um Norse mythology, that's almost like a separate thing, although it's definitely intertwined. Like they they think that these are actual historical documents in a lot of cases, or at least have a large kernel of historicity in them. And so in those sagas they talked about arriving in Greenland around a thousand see, around the same time they would have set up the place in Newfoundland, um, and finding Irish missions that were already there. It's a little odd. And and also we should say the Norse were familiar with the Irish already, so they would have known in Irish mission if they came upon an Irish mission. Yeah. Sure, So that that would suggest that the Irish beat them to Greenland at least, which is pretty pretty significant. Yeah. There was another saga where they talked about meeting some of the Native Americans who already had seen white men. They're like, we know guys like you, and we've encountered guys sort of like you. They were dressed in white and they came from Land across from their own or our own I guess if I'm in character. And then there was a third saga that talks about the Norse encountering a tribe of Native Americans who spoke a language that even sounded like Irish. Right, So a lot of little clues here. Yeah, these are recorded by the North and they definitely do suggest that there was possibly some Irish who made their way over to the New World before the Vikings even did. But like you said, there is a lot of um. There's a heaping helping of folklore along with all of this, and for people like you, Chuck, it breaks down everything. I like to hold out hope that this is possible and true. And let's talk about it a little more after these commercial breaks. All right, we're in a divided camp. How divided? Uh? This is when the petroglyph comes in. Barry Fell, who was a marine biologist at Havid University, found some petroglyphs, which are rock carved writings in West Virginia, and he said, you know what these are. This is ogam script. This is this is an Irish alphabet and it was used from the sixth to the eighth century. And I even think I know what it's saying. They're talking about the Christian Nativity write on a rock, sure, and that's Irish, clearly, Uh, it's not, you know, from Native Americans. And Fell said, here, everyone take a look at this stuff. And the academic world said, I don't know about that. I don't even know if this, I don't know about your methods is definitely not a fact, I said, aren't you a marine biologists? Exactly? And this could be ogam script, but it's really not proving anything. No, so the the it's still not definitively been shown. Who wrote that. It's called the Horse Creek petroglyphs near Clear Fork, West Virginia, UM And they don't know who wrote it. But I think the local um Archaeological Society came out and said it's pretty racist to assume that rather than the local indigenous people leaving these petroglyphs, that it was some mythical Irish um monk who made his way over here allegedly rather than the people we know we're here in this area at that time. UM. But regardless of whether that's the case or not, like no one has said, oh, well, it was these people and this is what it said, So there's still definitely room for speculation. But from what I understand, there's there's virtually no academic who who believes that this is in fact ogham script, and even if it is an ogam, that it doesn't necessarily talk about the Nativity, so we can kind of discard that as evidence, like there's there's not certainly not in controvertible evidence of Irish presence because of that those petroglyphs. Yeah, and where it follows apart for me, but not not. I've been thinking about it, maybe not completely. Is when you start to look at the account the Navagaccio, the Travels of St. Brendan, which was the account of his voyage, it is it is really out there and wacky. It talks about an island with an Ethiopian devil, an island with monks who celebrated Christmas who were just there. Uh, they fought a griffin at one point and killed a griffin, um, all kinds of fantastical stuff. They went to one island and set up camp and then it turned out, oh, my goodness, is not an island. We're actually on a giant whale. So let's hold communion so let's have communion. I don't know if that was where the communion was. It was a bunch of whale stuff, but they definitely held communion on a whale at some point. It might have been that chapter. But it's kind of crazy stuff. And I started looking into it. There were what it is is an Irish im ram, which were the seventh and eighth century uh seafaring adventure tales written by the Irish, and it fits in with that, and so I immediately dismissed. I was like, no, this is just an uh m rom and it's you know, it's just made up. But I thought, well, maybe not. Maybe it took the style of that because that was what was popular, and maybe it really did happen, but it just they gussies it up with these fantastical tales. They dressed it up. Yeah. And then Navogaccio was written about two to three hundred years after St. Brennan would have lived, right, so it certainly wasn't his own account of it. But the it's almost like, to me, it's almost like Hamilton's Like if you came along and saw Hamilton's the musical, You're like, this is ridiculous. They didn't rap right. Um, You're like, there's a larger point to and that there was a person named Alexander and Alexander Hamilton's he did do these things, you know, but it is dressed up to make it palatable or understandable to people at the time and then embellished. I'm sure, although I don't think Alexander Hamilton's would have given commune on the back of a whale. Um, but it's still in the same ballpark. And to me, just because somebody came along and dressed it up with with folklore, clearly folklore doesn't mean that there's It doesn't remove the possibility that there is a lot of kernels of truth still in there somewhere. Yeah, I kind of, I kind of got there during the last eight minutes. I'm glad about that. What is interesting is one of the things that they kind of used to say no, this probably couldn't have happened was the fact that the sailing technology at the time, the boating technology that he would have likely used is this little boat called a curoc and it a see you are are a c h and it's this you know, it's a it's a homemade boat. Basically made out of wood with an ox hide and like tar and stuff to put it together. And they're like, there's no way this guy could have made it that far in one of these crocs, and in UH, an author, an adventurer named Tim Severin, said, you know what, I'm going to see if this is possible, And he built one of those, supposedly in the style that they would have built them back then, and he retraced that route that Brendan is believed to have taken from Ireland to Iceland and Greenland and eventually Newfoundland, and he made it. Yeah, he showed it is entirely possible. And again this this same Brendan was supposed to be a very skilled navigator. So it's possible at least that that that happened if sing Brendan actually did exist. Like many stuff you should know, shorties the ends with a big shoulder shrug, a big shoulder shrug, puffy question mark with a heart for the dot. Amen. Uh. And by the way, you can read this article um that we found on how stuff works. I wrote it myself back in the day and with that short Stuff is out.
