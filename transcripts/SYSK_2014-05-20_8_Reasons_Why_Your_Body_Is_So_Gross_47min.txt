Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark Wood throws w Chuck Bryant. Do do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do do? And this is news flashes that the wire coming through. I'm watching the wire. By the way. Oh yeah, the TV show wasn't that either recommended that to me. I don't think so. I've only seen like one episode of it. Oh, which is the show that you said started it all? The Shield? Oh no, no, I'm sorry. I like the shield. Okay, so it's like the shield would be like you like the Stones or the Beatles, you like the wire or the shield? Way before this was OZ. I thought the Wire was before OZ. OZ was before the Wire. Yeah, by like a decade. I'm taking the wire. Yeah, I've heard nothing of good things. The one that I think it was like dead Wood. I saw an episode of I was like, I don't have room in my life for this right now? That was so great? Yeah, I'm sure, yeah, but yeah, I was just like, I can't commit to this. The wires a slow burn. It's like, um, that was before they were trying to like blow you out of the water every week with some like amazing final scenes. It's it's almost a documentary ask. Oh nice, Yeah, it's really good. Yeah, I guess I kind of picked up on that the episode I saw it was exciting. Well, now I gotta watch ODZ too, Yeah you do. I was all piste off. I thought I was gonna impress you and you'd be like, your homework is done. Yeah, no, you have a lot to do. Chuck all right. With OZ, they think there's at least like three or four seasons. Well, that's an odd start to this episode. It is because in this episode, oh, Jerry's here by the way. Uh. In this episode, um, we're talking about your body, yes, which I guess the human body was on display to some degree in different ways in OZ. But that's not what we're talking about really. In this we're talking about how like you sitting there, you probably feel pretty good right now. You may be showered, you just got a haircut recently, like haircut, your hair smells like pencil shavings. Uh. And uh, let's see what else did you know that? Like a haircut to you me smells like recently, um, sharpened pencil. I did not know that isn't that we every haircut weird like a haircut does, like cutting the grass, smell like almonds. And then she has a well she's okay, she's fine. She yeah, she just smells pencil shavings with haircuts. But um, you're you're feeling pretty good. Back to my little intro um, and by you, I'm talking to everybody out there. Well, you don't realize is this You're disgusting. You're disgusting bag of nastiness. Basically if you really want to get down on a granular cellular uh even just an internal level, Yeah, you're you're gross. Thank you. Yeah, I'm gross too. I'm not sitting in judgment like I I have all of these things as well. Most likely, Um well yeah, I mean it's not like I like perspective. I just it's it's when you say you, it's like uh J McNerney novel. You know, it's like put you in like the first person of the action. So all of a sudden, you're the one who has a coke problem and it's like four in the morning on a Tuesday in Manhattan and you have to go to work in two hours. You know, it has more impact when you're saying that. Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna nod and act like I know what that reference was. It's a bright Lights, Big City reference. Okay, surely you've read that. I never read that. You haven't read that. That was awesome. Yeah, it was good. It was good. It was in that swid movie, the whole Yeah, it's in that whole Bread eastern ellis vain sure like, uh yeah, party in too much less than zero kind of thing. Yeah, I read um well, I read American Psycho and lesson Zero. Okay, yeah, yeah, this is one of his contemporaries is still around. J mc McNerney or Jane mkearney something like that. They both like their drugs and loud music and yeah, dancing and Michael J. Fox is in the movie Bright Lightspeag City. Anyway, it's a good book, but it's all in like that first person. Where is that? Second person? Yeah? Second person familiar? Anybody your gross? Let's get to why chucky. So we're gonna talk about some of the gross things going on inside the body. And I think this article had ten but since we've covered bacteria and poop so thoroughly. Plus it's a long standing stuff. You should have tradition to never do all ten of any ten list. And and it's we should also say is arbitrary that all lists on how stuff works in and ten I think, yeah, it's a nice round number. Um. Alright, so I guess we'll start with eyelash mites, um, which I didn't know about until now, did you? No? I didn't either. Mites are little arthur pods there in the same family as ticks, and um. They, if you are generally an older person, are living on your eyelashes. Yeah, and not just your eyelashes. There's actually two types of what are called dermodex mites or demo decks. I'm sorry. Demo is uh, it's basically Latin for lard, and dex is a boring insect, So it's a fat, boring insect that demodex might And you have two kinds, ones that live in your hair follicles and the one that live in your pores basically from what I understand. Yeah, dogs, there's another kind for dogs too. Well. There's like tens of thousands of of types of demodex mites, but there's only two that live on humans, and they live on our faces. Yeah, and like I said, more likely if you're older, just because as you age you produce more oils like see them. Kids don't produce a lot of see them, So you're probably not gonna have a child with eyelash mites. If you do, then so services is probably gonna come after, although they won't be able to tell because these seems are very tiny, like you. They apparently move around at night. There's a really good, um, very exhaustive article on demodex might by science writer Ed Young. Are you familiar with him, Uh, the Youngster? Yeah? Yeah, dude, speaking of stirs, you know Ed the Grabster Ed Grabanowski, who writes some of the best articles that have formed the basis for some of the best episodes of stuff You should know. He finally came out and claimed his birthright on Twitter. I saw that he said I am the Grabster, I'm I'm I'm coming out and saying hi, And I did. And I had never seen his face before. I had once because he commented on some other oh yeah, or like a Dungeons and Dragons forum or something like that. It came across the comment and it was pretty much the same picture. Yeah, it's definitely kind of weird because I mean, if anyone the Grabster is almost like the fourth stuff you should know team member, you know, like we probably covered more of his articles than anyone else I would guess, so, so welcome Ed anyway, Yeah, into the world. Ed Young had a good one on demo decks mites on Discover magazine's blog. Um, it's basically everything you could ever want to know about them, and I think that's even the title of it too. Well. They, like you said, they move around at night because they don't like light. Um at a very slow pace eight to sixteen millimeters per hour, and you can't see them, but they're microscopic there below the threshold of human sight. Yeah. And while it might sound gross for your grandparents to have mites in their eyelashes, Um, there's really no trouble with them. They're not going to cause you any pain or suffering generally. Yeah, they think it's possible that one of the two varieties are responsible for rosatia UM and right, if you're um particularly sensitive skin wise, you may find them irritable. But for the most part, you probably have, especially if you're over age sixty, you probably do have demodex mites living in your face and just don't even know it, and they're crawling across it at night while you sleep. Um. And I found another little interesting mite fact today that was just in the news. Um, there's a southern California Mike called the Para Tarso Thomas Macro Palace played by Brendan Fraser. Now I think it's Shyola booth. Um. Brendan Fraser. Man, remember he was in Man. Yeah, a good one with Polly Shore and Shawan Austin had like the early nineties Triumvirate. Sean wasn't that Yeah, I believe he was the street man. Um. So this might has just been recorded as the fastest land animal beating out the cheetah. Wow, this might move three two body lengths per second. So obviously it's tiny, but that's super fast because the cheetah only moves sixteen body links the second. Yeah, so it's the new fastest animal. Well. Remember I think it was the cockroach episode where we figured out like that's the true measure of speed when you're comparing different sized things, because remember the cockroachs can move like fifty I think body links a second, which is way faster than that, is fast. Well, my hat has been taken off for this. Might it's the demo DECKX might. No, it's not. I to know that was. That would be a lot of eyelash to cover. Okay, well let's say we move on, all right, We'll go from the eyelash over a little bit to the ear, where you may or may not know. You have something called serum gross inside seremon. I like it either way. I think any anything with the word s e r sounds sort of oily. It's c e r oh is it c e r U m e n h. Yeah, which I guess you can make it with a hard seat like Cruman. No, I don't think so. If you're a German you could. But so you tell my ear wax though and Layman's terms ear wax. Everyone's got it and we don't like it. Americans spend about sixty million North Americans, so I guess that includes our hat and our pants spend more than sixty million dollars a year h on ear cleaning products. And what's crazy is a lot of those ear cleaning products, UH, including cotton swabs attached to sticks, generic generic um those actually supposedly are detrimental to or counterproductive to cleaning ear wax out because your ear wax is produced in the outer third of your ear. When you use a cotton tip or anything cotton swab, yeah, or anything even your finger, and you push it into your ear canal, yeah, you're not removing your X. You're pushing it further in and it's not meant to be in there, and it doesn't go in there unless you jam it in there. So when you're using some sort of swab or anything to clean out your ear X, you're you're doing the opposite. You're creating what can become a hardened build up, and then you really have problems. Yeah, like real problem the ear is pretty much self cleaning. Um. Real block edge only occurs and about six percent of people. Um. But you might know that you have an impactation if you have decreased hearing, your dizziness or pain, or if it sounds like you got your fingers in your ears or ringing or itching or drainage. That means you've either had it and happened naturally and you're one of the six percent, or you've stuffed it in there with a cotton swab and not done yourself any favors that in elvo grease mixed together. Not good. Can we talk about your handling too, sure you know the deal with your handling, right. What what they claim is that you have this cone of paper, Um, what is it? Like a waxy paper? You light it on fire and stick in ear ear and it's supposed to create a vacuum supposedly that sucks out this uh wax. That's not true. It is a big, big falsehood sold to you by the makers of ear candles. And they can actually be dangerous and they do not create a vacuum and they do not pull wax out of your ears. So if you're an ear candler, you're doing the wrong thing because doctors say it's can be dangerous. Um. And it's actually illegal. They have them in the US, but it's illegal to sell them making any claims. Oh I thought you're gonna say, they're just straight up illegal. No. But you can't like if you notice ear kindling packages, can't say anything about like has like increases your hearing or is medically sound. Um. And if you've seen the candles rolled open and all that disgusting stuff that didn't come from your ear, that's that's a product of the burning of the paper, Is that right, Yeah, so it's just a bunch of bunk. So apparently if you do have uh what if you believe you have a hardened build up of ear wax in your ear canal, the first thing to try is just a couple of drops of mineral oil. Yeah, because basically all that ear wax build up is is it's dried ear wax. Like you said, ear wax is part of a self cleaning process. Anytime you chew or move your jaw, you're actually moving the ear wax further and further out beside your ear and then you can just kind of, you know, rub it out, or if you're a gross person, you just leave it and let it get caught up in your ear hair for some reason. But if you have a build up, you just just a little bit of mineral oil will kind of re constitute it a little bit and so it drains out. Yeah, I guess it'll work itself back out again. Yeah. Yeah. Um I used the cotton swabs occasionally, but um, I try to be responsible and like be aware of not jamming things down in there and trying just like swab along the outer outer thing. I do not use swabs in my ears are perfect perfectly clean, Yeah they are. Um, I do use the end of a football though. That seems to work. I have great memories about um my mother treating me with warm oil for ear aches when I was a kid. For some reason, it's just a very comforting feeling. I remember that warm oil like filling up my ear and it closing. Yeah. Yeah, and it worked. Yeah, I think it helped the ear ache. And it's just it's just one of those soothing, like mom things from when I was a kid. I didn't have I mean, I have had ear aches before, but I didn't have them chronically. You mean, did I guess too? And yeah, that just seems so awful to have, like chronic ear aches. Yeah, I had bloody noses and ear aches. Weird, did you fall down a lot or no? And I haven't had a bloody nose and like since I was a kid, But yeah, I remember kids who had bloody noses a little like like chronically. I wouldn't say mine was chronic. I wasn't. Like it just seems like you know, now when you look around, if there's somebody with clean X like sticking out of their nose, you're like, oh my god, are you okay? But when you're a kid, it's like commonplace, Like half of your class has clean X chicking out of their nose at any time. It's just I wonder what that is. We'll have to do how bloody knows is work? Yeah, or we could do a fallow up to this Why kids are so disgusting? Yeah, kids are especially gross even though they lacked dermodex. Your demodex. Miight? Um, all right, you ready for another one? Yeah, this one's so gross. Uh. Lipoma or fatty deposits is something that you have in your body. Um, well, once you go ahead, explain about fatty cells, period and why these might want to leave that scene. Actually, we don't even know what causes this still, No, I mean, like you accumulate fat in your body through your metabolic processes, Like different different macro nutrients are convert in the liver I think too fat, right, So the fats are generally stored in like certain areas like around your gut, like in your lower back, in your buttocks, and your breasts. Like there's just places where fat normally goes. That doesn't mean like that's where it has to go and technically, fat build up can happen anywhere, and when it happens in a place that just seems kind of weird. We've dubbed those like pomas or fatty deposits, which are technically a benign form of a soft tissue tumor. And it's just a bunch of fat cells that have like come up on your face or your neck or something where you're just like, man, this is not a good day. Yeah, your neck, shoulders, arms, upper back, upper thoughts, in your butt or where you're most likely to get them. And uh, it's between the skin and the muscle. And it's just like a little sort of soft, doughy lump that you can move around with your finger. Yeah, and it touches squishes around. Because most of the time it's not painful. And if it is painful, um, it's recommended that you go have a doctor check it out pretty quick. Yeah. Um, it's probably not any cause of alarm. If you have one um period, like you said, if it starts to hurt though, or if it ruptures and oozes anything, then yeah, that's when you should go to the doctor. The problem is they don't tend to really go away. They don't once they once they arrive, they either won't grow much beyond that or they'll grow very slowly. But the problem is they don't reverse course, and just pushing them isn't going to push him back down and spread them out. So you generally have two options when you have a lipoma that you don't want, and that's liposuction, which may or may not be effective, and then surgical removal, which is apparently like an impatient local and aesthetic procedure that you can just go and have it done. If you have a high pain threshold and a lot of gaulls, you can technically do it yourself. But you don't want to do that. And let me just reiterate, you don't want to do that. That was a total joke. Do not remove your life poema as yourself. No, although my um I go to the dermatologist occasionally get little skin tags removed. Is there any kind of local anesthetic for that? Yeah, they do, just a quick little uh uh injection. But I don't even think they need to. And my doctor, the point I was making was my g P said, you know you can do that yourself. I said, really, yeah, if you want to just get some super sharp you know plyers or scisters or something not plyers, but you know snippers and get some bolt cutters. Yeah. Oh man, um, yeah, I was kind of surprised to hear him say that. Yeah, just do it yourself, because doctors love money. I know, you know, they want your money. Well, he's not my dermatologist. My dermatologist probably be like, no, no, was he like your plumber or something? No, my gph. They love money, their doctors. How about mucus. Mucus sounds great. Uh, let's cover it right up for this message. Okay, mucus. Uh, let's talk about it. Boogers and mucus and snot Let's are you a snotty person? You're not very snotty. I'm not snotty because I'm not. I don't have allergies, and I think that's people with allergies are definitely snottier. Oh yeah, for sure, Emily sadly is very snotty. Yeah, Well, snot is a snot production. Mucus production is a is part of the immune response to things like irritants a k A buffalo wing sauce. Yeah, um, and people who drink milk. It can be activated by that sometimes. Yeah, milk can make people kind of snotty. Um, But mucus production is not strictly the result of an infection or an invasion or an irritation. Uh. It's a very natural, beautiful biological process that's ongoing every day. Yeah. I mean, we need mucus in our body. It acts as a lubricant and a liner of things like your stomach um. And we'll get to stomach acid later. But if it wasn't for mucus, then you would be in big trouble in your stomach. Um. Your body makes about a quarter to a half a gallon a quarter to a half a gallon of mucus a day. Again, yeah, your body makes a quarter to a half gallon of mucus to day. I think you swallow like a leader of that or something. Yeah, I think so. I can't remember. I remember reading that earlier though, And we should say, for our friends who are listening outside of the US and Liberia, that's one to two leaders a day of mucus that your body produces. Yeah, yeah, which I have to say. And I feel like a chump for not looking it up and not thinking about it until now, Like, why where does it go? Do you pee it out? No? I mean if you're swallowing, it doesn't go into your stomach, okay, but then you you expel the stuff that's in your stomach one way or another. It was probably part of your poop. I'm sure it's part of it. But I mean, like, I mean, where did your mucus go? Yeah? Oh, man, I wish I would have thought of this before, because that's a great question. Well, and the angel question if you're sick, is it make you healthier or not as healthy to swallow your mucus? I don't know, do you know? Yeah? I think I looked it up and I think it's not supposed to make any difference. So um, I've found that you know how mucus turns green, and it's a sure sign of an infection. Not necessarily true, right, No, it does mean that you probably do have an infection going on, or at the very least your body thinks it does, do um, But it doesn't. It's not. It doesn't indicate the presence of bacteria in your mucus. That's not what turns it green. There's a type of white blood cells that um have a greenish tint, and when it's fighting off an infection. When they accumulate in your mucus, they turn it kind of greenish color, yellow green. So it's actually a type of white blood cell that's making your mucus green. But it probably means that you have some sort of infection there. Yeah, And if you're sick and you're hacking up that yellowy greeny brown stuff, then it's disheartening at least just concerning. That's the time to apply mind over matter and be like, nope, I'm not getting sick. I don't care if my mucus is yellow. That's your whole thing. It works knock on wood, um so dry mucus. It is called the boogers, and uh, those are in your nose. And you're gonna tell them about the video? Oh yeah, if you want to see. Almost posted it to the Facebook page and it's just like now, yeah, yeah, there's a video on YouTube. It's something about dr removes Um Booker from Hell from man's nose and are seconds of your not recommending you watch it that you'll never forget. I can say this, I was not prepared for how large what came out of that man's nose at all. I thought, well, I'm sure, this will be interesting. I didn't know anything could get that large and either one stay in there or be be braw it out. It's it's rough. It's like it's a cathartic nauseating experience to watch this thing. It is And I didn't listen to the video, so I don't know if it was. Was it a booger? Do you know? Did he say? I mean, yeah, I believe so. Yeah. I didn't listen to it. They just are like, He's like, wow, now you can see why it was so uncomfortable. Yeah, I'm sure, but boogers are nothing but dry mucus and um, they're actually I tried to look up why children eat their boogers? Yeah, muco flagi, Yeah, that's right, or if you're really into it, rhino tellvimania. So it's a mania. Well, I guess it can be. And I think they found people with obsessive compulsive people pick their nose more, which sort of makes sense. But why do kids eat their boogers? I couldn't come up with a definitive answer other than they think it's like our natural instinct because it may make you healthier, and that eating your boogers could be like a injection of of immunity for your immune system because of the bacteria and stuff. I don't think little kids are smart enough to think this. Well, no, that's what I'm saying. They're not smart enough, but they just it's their instinct to do so. And it is all people's instinct if you believe. If you believe some people to eat your own boogers, who says that. The people that say that's why kids do it, It's because it's our natural instinct as humans to do so because it helps keep us healthy. Yeah. Hey, it's really new research. I'm not like, I'm not making this stuff. I gotta check that out. Yeah, and I'm not endorsing it. I'm just saying, you know, like I'm I'm a tissues are the way to get it out. Supposedly picking it, uh can like cause more problems because bacteria on your fingers, and doctor says I wouldn't get so many nose pleads if I kept my finger. I'm a fan of the snot rocket though, which I'm trying to teach Emily to do, but she's not very good at it. Oh yeah, so gross, dude, do you really like doing that? Not? In like if I have a choice. If I'm like out for a run in the wintertime, I don't let snot just run all over my face. I blow it out real quick. I would just rather wipe it on my shirt. That's not gross. I don't know it's gross, but at least it's like gross. No, that's gross. Man, you just turn my stomach not rocket. Um, I'm gonna bring back the hanky, are you? Yeah? That seems so uncivilized. It was so gross to me as a child. I remember seeing the old men in church that would just blow just copious amounts of snot and to that thing, fold it up and put it back in their pocket. And you're like, you're not gonna eat that, don't you know what? Help? And then my nose will bleed and then just walk off. Alright, So that's enough on booger's in mucus. Huh again, my stomach is not okay right now? All right, So we should talk about gas because and that was fascinated with the notion that everyone farts. As a child, I used to think about the least likely person in the world to fart and just laugh and laugh, like, who would you come up with something? Yeah, Godda, your the Queen of England, stuff like that. But now it's more like Cape Blanchet or people that I consider to be like refined um. But everyone farts and everyone burps. Yes, it's a part of health, you know. And supposedly if you um hold your try to hold your flatulence, and there's an urban legend that it's very bad for you. It just makes it better later. Well, the gas comes out one way or another. Um and your belch and your flatulence are not the same thing. It's not like the same piece of gas or volume of gas coming out one way or the other piece of gas piece. Uh. Yeah, it's not coming from the same pocket. No, there's um of belt comes from your stomach and flatulence comes from your intestines, but they do come from the same thing. And that's um incompletely broken down food, right, So like if your food is totally broken down, I guess technically you wouldn't produce any gas. But our bodies are are digestive systems aren't efficient. So as a byproduct of this breakdown UM, the gas is produced by these bacteria that break down our food for us. And I guess there's some chunks that they have problem with and it's like, forget it, I'm just gonna create some gas. I'm done here with this London broil, right, And so it comes out one way or another. Yeah, at the rate of between fourteen and twenty three times a day, um, for both burping and farting together, which um might seem like a lot, but over the course of twenty four hours, because it does happen when you sleep. I think we've all experienced that, not me. Are you sure that I'm sure that I have? Um, I know that I have. And of course I'm not shaming You're like everyone else. You're like the Queen of England or Chet. But I'm like those two mixed together. Uh so you're Judy Ditch. Yeah she parts. Do you see phil Amina? No? No yet? My god, that's a good movie. Yeah, that's on the list. That's a good movie. I think that one in Twelve Years of Slave were the only two, like a big Do you haven't seen Twelve Years of Slave either? No? Not yet? Man alive? Well, I need to see that, oz you basically you have to go home after this. Well I'm trying to. You have to get up for a movie like Twelve Years of slave. You know, it's not like anytime mood movie. No, and you just kind of have to like walk into it, like walking into a thresher or something like that. Yeah. And when I say get up for it, I don't mean get psyched. I mean like getting the right fail first. So it is a very brutal experience watching that movie. Yeah, and that's into it. Avoid those when I can, but you should see it. I mean it's still just like an amazing movie. Yeah. So what is actually in burbs and farts besides oxygen? Yeah, there would be oxygen. Um, there's a methane CEO two, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur and yes, and all of this is uh, well, like I said, part of it is from a breakdown of food. I think I might have said all of it, it's not entirely true. A lot of your gas build up in your body. Uh. It can be simply from swallowed air. Um, it can be from a change in pressure, like um, how you tend not me, but everybody else tends to shoot ducks on airplanes more. Oh, really interesting as a result of the just the change in pressure, even in a pressurized cabin. It's not dead on with whatever atmosphere you used to where you live, so you can, um get a little gassy on the plane, but it's the worst place to ever be gassy. It is. Luckily though, with airplane flatulence. A lot of times it doesn't have any attendant smell to it because it's not true methane or sulfur based air. Yes, it's just that you're the amount of gas volume that your body can hold right then has decreased, so you're having to evacuate some of the air and you're like, hey, it didn't smell. Yeah, well no, you're just kind of looking around furtively and looking to see if anybody's like ah and like turns to the side away from you in their seat, and if they don't, then you're find Yeah, I wouldn't risk it. It also helps to ask for a blanket for uh. And yeah, you can make yourself burp too. I guess that makes sense about the swallowing air. Like that's a big discovery as a young boy when when you can master that technique. Um, and because there's methane and your farts they are flammable and I would not recommend you do this, but uh, I think if you're a college age boy. You've probably tried to it's not a lawyer. Yeah, um, yeah, I mean it's it can be great fun and but it's also dangerous. Have you done that, Chuck, Not in the past, like twenty years, but yeah, And I think some of the times it's just approve to other people that like, no, that's an urban legend, scientific fact. Watch exactly well it is. Yeah, I'm sure YouTube is loaded with videos of that. Yeah, you see, you know't you have to do it yourself if you're interested, you can look it up. Um, and I I recommend that we move on to the next thing. But first, Chuck, before we get into it, how about a message bright huh yes, all right, So um, we have a few more here. Um. Vomiting. Yeah, the word vomit has always been in my top five, like most hated words. Oh yeah, I mean it's seems to really kind of capture what the process, the feeling, the end product vomit. Yeah. Yeah, it's gross, it is, but I mean it's a it's a natural fact of life. It's in you now. Potentially whatever your stomach contents are could turn into vomit. So it's not because you're expelling like bile, gastric juices, saliva, food, you know, liquids, whatever, um, and all of those things were once just a happy part of your stomach contents, and now they're not, so therefore they have by definition become vomit. Right and um, your stomach, the average stomach holds about three quarters of a gallon of whatever you've ingested, food and beverage. Um, And it is possible. It's super rare. But if you've ever said, you know, I feel like I'm gonna burst. You can't eat and drink so much that your stomach will rupture. But it's um, it's really rare because what happens is your body's gag reflex takes over and you vomit if you get too full. Um. Like if you've watched the eating we did a show on eating competitions, Yeah, we did, like eighty years ago. Yeah. It was a good one though. Uh. And you know sometimes those guys just spontaneously puke. Yeah there. Um. Remember they're called gurgitators, yeah, which is the opposite of regurgitating. But if they regurgitate, they have to swallow it back down or else that doesn't get counting. God, if I remember correctly, so gross um, But luckily you have that gag reflex. But there have been a couple of documented cases. There was one in Japan in two thousand three where a man was found dead in a public restroom and they found his stomach had ruptured in two places. Put that movie seven. Oh yeah, it is true. He was force fed. Now, if you don't vomit, there is another like plan CEE that your body has where the lining your stomach starts to just kind of leak contents out into the rest of your body, which is really bad, but it's not at least a full on rupture. Um. What you are designed to do if you believe in intelligent design, I guess or what you're what you will do. But I just walked into a minefield right then, didn't I? Uh, is to to vomit up your stomach contents as a result of your chemoreceptor trigger zone being stimulated. And there's a bunch of ways that that that can be stimulated. UM. This little part of your brain it's also called the area post dreama, So that's what triggers the vomiting mechanism. That's the vomiting center of your brain, and it is its function, Yes, it's function is it receives signals from different from your vagus nerve, which is attached to your gag reflex from your nervous system. So when you're when you're in chemotherapy, this thing kind of triggers your vomit reflex from your stomach, your gut um. There's like four or five different places in your body. Your inner ear is one that can send um chemical messages to your chemo receptor trigger zone to say, hey, we need to vomit here because this guy is either going to like this guy just ate poop and as we know, you're not supposed to do that, so we need to get it out of them. There's something wrong with this guy. Uh, so let's just go around him and get that poop out by making him vomit. So what happens is the ct Z, the chemo receptor trigger zone, is stimulated one way or another. So you start to salivate a little more, you're breathing, Yeah, you start to get real queasy, like pull the car over. You start heaving or wretching. Right, that's gonna take place before you actually vomit. It's almost like your diaphragmes like getting ready like jack lolane or something, well, sort of a violent action, you know. Yes. Uh, the pyloric sphincter, which guards the lower end of the stomach, um, it becomes relaxed and the pressure in the abdomen rises, so the pressure in your chest or thorax is lowered, which is basically what happens is the pressure below increases, well, the pressure above decreases, so it's like, so what's what was once below can come back up right, and the sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading you to start sweating, and all of a sudden you just vomit. It's like a contraction. Wow, it's not pleasant. No, it's not. And while the end results, like if you have a stomach flue or if you're just nauseous, um, well, uh could call some relief. I don't know many people that, um, you know look forward to the experience. No, you know, no, that's like that is not something you ever want to do, no matter even if you know like it's going to bring you relief, you still don't want to throw up, you know, and you'll put it off and put it off because it's just the worst thing in the world. But what what has always fascinated me. Is the idea that something nausea, which is kind of like the body's warning, like you want me to make you throw up, well, and stop looking at this, stop eating poop, you know, stop thinking about eating poop? Is that? Like, are we have an emotion called disgust that is primed to trigger nausea and then possibly vomiting if it's bad enough or threatening enough, so that like we have an instinct to not eat boogers or to not eat poop, or to stay away from vomit or decaying meat or something. You have this emotion that primes us to to to stay away from things that will make us vomit. I just find that fascinating. It is or in the movies, I should add this to the movie tropes. Uh, if you're just too emotionally distressed about something that will trigger in movies, I'll make you vomit. You know, like if you see the wrong thing and all of a sudden you just have to run over and vomit behind a tree. Right right, there's that cop that were top vomits you know on the body. Yep, it's a movie trope. Yeah, that is a that was a really good um list. You came up with overused movie tropes, I think. So. I did a gallery on the Stuff you Should Know website and it was fan source, Like I asked people on Facebook and uh man, people just went nuts for it because they're just so overused. Um, check it out on Stuff you should Maybe I'll do a part two because there was a bunch of more and I'll add the vomiting cop. Yeah, that's a good one. You can't handle the murder scene. Um, all right there, here's when we missed in our halitosis episode. And we heard from people that have tonsil stones um or chronic tonsil stones. Another word for it is, uh, what is it? Ton tons lolis so pronounce like so lo liths tons lolas lis like it ends in l s. Yeah. It's a terrible, terrible word, it is. But we heard from people who suffer from this um and it can be a cause of halitosis and those Uh, if you've ever like you know, if you don't have a chronic version, you might have just cough one up occasionally a little like white, whitish, yellow, chunky thing that is one of the worst smells that you can ever imagine in the world. All of this that that funky smell you get whenever you flosh your teeth, but combined into a ball, it looks a bit like cauliflower, like super concentrated. Yeah. Well, we remember in the Hila Tosis episode we said that the back of your tongue is like this trap for dead cells. The bacteria that eats those dead cells and then whatever other gunk. Well, these tonsil pockets where the tonsil stones form are like make your tongue look like a pristine wonderland. Like they just accept this, these deposits that build up and up and up and then Yeah, those things stink. I wonder if the guy that was sitting next to me in the movie theater had those, now that I think about it, because it's possible, Yeah, I feel sorry for people that suffer from it. Um, well, it's pretty fixable, supposedly. Yeah, you can do this at home. It's not like a lipoma. So how do you fix it at home? Well, you can do tonsil irrigation basically from what I understand, like a little squirt bottle, you know the ones with the ninety degree straws that football players use like that, and you just squirt your tonsils and it can clean them out. Um. I believe brushing your tongue can help because it's the helps prevent the accumulation. Yeah, scraping your tongue too, write uh and then what else was there? Chuck? I think non alcohol based mouthwashes can help, yes, and um or if you have a chronic case of it and um, you could get your tonsils removed right, which I would like to do if I had a chronic case of tonsil stones, sure, because it's not just the bad breath that comes along with it, like you can get ear aches, sore throats, in flame tonsils like it's not it's not like your body's just like whatever, tonsil stones? Who cares you? It hurts it? Yeah, And this is another one, all these gross things for some reason like childhood as a wheady discover a lot of them. And I remember distinctly my brother the first time he uh cough one up and smashed it and made me smell it. Oh my god, yeah, because that caught them up before. But I've never smashed it and smelled it. Oh man, Like you've seen these things like yeah, he's like smell this, Oh man, what what happened? To you, did you vomit? No? I didn't, but yeah, it made me realize, Wow, that's what those are, and that's what they smell like. That's really grows man. This whole episode. I'm just kind of like, I'm over it. And we talked about some funky stuff before too, but this is the first time where I've had like kind of an ongoing stomach ache. Yeah, so I guess we'll finish it up with something that's super gross. No, that's a stomach acid. Yeah, which is hydrochloric acid, which is the same kind of hydrochloric acid that you can use to dissolve metal. Yeah, got a gun you want to get the serial number off of hydrochloric acid that is in your stomach. And uh, like I kind of spoiled earlier because your stomach is coated with mucus on the inside. That is the reason that that hydrochloric acid isn't burning through your stomach. Yes, that was some great foreshadowing, it was. Do you have anything else on that stomach acid? It's in there, Yeah, I mean it's just there. It's a combination of hydrogen and chloe ride. When it combines, you get some HCl action, and there you have it. Yeah, some of the grossest things in your body as we speak. Yeah, I guess probably that's why it burns to throw up, because you have a tremendous amount of mucous line in your stomach to keep it from dissolving. But and you have some along your your throat and airways and your esophagus but not as much. So that's why bile burns. Yeah, And I know if stomach bile, if you suffer from bulimia, um that acid can you can end up having like bad teeth because of it, because yeah, wearing down the enamel from the inside out and and supposedly the stomach rupturing is more common if you suffer from bolimia because you may have a bad gag reflex as a result, so it may not like react when it should if you're overeating. Man, lots of stuff going on in the body. Huh. I said it before and I'll say it again. You're a gross Yeah. Thank god we're wrapped in skin and hair. Yeah, because that's that's lovely stuff all the time. Anyway, Yes, it is. Uh. If you want to learn more about ten gross things in your body, we didn't cover two of them, so there's two more for you to check out. At least you can type gross body into the search bar at how stuff works dot com. Uh, and be sure to check out Chuck movie tropes gallery to at stuff you Should Know dot com. And since I just plug two sites in one, you know it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna call this high five from a feminist. Hey guys, my name is Wendy and the editor for the feminist website Good Good Girl. I just wanted to drop your line and say how much I enjoyed the podcast on burlesque. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of neo burlesque, not for any feminist reason. It's just not my bag. But I was surprise how enthralled I was with its history. More than your background, the part of the podcast that really stood out was how well you two handled the two feminist perspectives that surround it. I thought you did a really banging job of presenting the argument, framing each side, but respectfully acknowledging that as men, it's probably not your place to make a definitive statement on it. Feminism and gender are tricky subjects, but they're also so interesting, exciting to talk about because I'm always sad um and I'm always sad when guys feel like they can't take part. I think a lot of dudes feel it's not their place to comment. But you just showed that anyone is welcome and to talk about women's rights. It just needs to be approached with a bit of tact. It's a great job. I love the show. It's one of the highlights of my week. My friends are always joking that I start every second sentence with talking about blank. Did you know? Uh, don't worry. I always make sure to name check you, guys as my source. That is from Wendy cyprit and Sheet is an editor of Good Good Girl, which you can find at Good Good Girl dot com for all your feminist needs.
