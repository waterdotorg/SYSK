We all have things we like to think about. Online fraud shouldn't be one of them, because with every purchase, PISA Provinced, detects and resolves online fraud safe Secure Visa. Hi'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, a staff writer here at how Stuff Works dot Com. With me is my permanent co host. We just got the news. Chuck's here for good Charles, Chuck Bryant, Chuck, welcome. I hope you enjoyed that seat, because you're not getting mine. That is your seat. I do. It fits my my back end well, and I'm glad to be here. I'm glad. I'm Chuck. I hate to tell you this, but your fly is open. Oh yeah, wow, maybe you should do something about Sorry you guys. You guys can't see this because this is just an audio podcast. But Chuck is blushing with embarrassment. I've never seen Chuck blush before. It's okay, Chuck, I won't judge This is not a locker room though, so I wasn't prepared for that. Handle your business and we'll wait a second. Every show everything's good, So check that that actually brings to mind. Um an article I wrote, why do people Blush? Did you prep for this podcast? Did you read it? I did? Uh? It was It was a good one, Josh. I thought that it's pretty interesting. Blushing is one of those um things that people probably don't think about very often. Everyone blushes, and uh, it's exclusive to humans all of no other animal on the planet that blushes exactly. But um, we don't we we know how we blush, but we don't exactly know why we blush. And isn't that weird that that something is ubiquitous and seemingly normal is actually abnormal? You know? Do you want to tell the folks at home how we blush? Uh? Yeah, well it has to do with the uh, the old sympathetic system, which is also what controls the fight or flight syndrome or not syndrome. But yeah, fans of no so the fight or flights bonds. I wanted to say that last time to so fans of stuff you should know are will probably be familiar with our podcasts on hysterical strength, which I know all about the fight or flight response. It's the same thing. You're your veins and dilate and more blood gets pumping, and your your pupils uh get larger, and then all of a sudden you find that you might be able to throw a lawn more off your granddaughter like Boots he did, Hello Boots, Hello Boots. So yeah, and one of the other things is that your your blood vessels dilate, right, right, which is the case in blushing, right, Except the thing is the blood vessels in your cheeks that actually become flushed. Our veins um and oddly, veins don't usually respond at all to adrenaline, but for some reason, the veins in your cheeks too, and those are the only veins in your body that flush or dilate when your fight or flight response goes off. I mean, what the heck is that? Yeah, well, that's kind of weird because I mean it's what everyone would see. I mean, if your kneecaps blood, no one would ever know if you're embarrassed, So it happens in your face for maybe for a reason, maybe not. But there are some theories about why we blush like what Well, one of them is that it is in fact on the face so other people can see it, because it's a form of public apology for a faux pa you might have had, or if you stuck your foot in your mouth. Um, your blushing is a way to kind of be contrite and say, you know, I'm embarrassed and I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that without actually saying that. So it's like a physical example of your emotional intellect. You're saying, I'm aware of this. Don't don't beat me, you know, start a fight with me. It's sort of like the same thing that happens. Like if your dog hikes his leg on your dining room table and you walk in the room, it's a very good chance your dog might you know, lower his head and kind of back out of the room slowly, or roll over and show its belly. Yeah, show it's belly. It's a kind of a similar thing. I got you, okay, now, Um, I don't buy that one. I think it's kind of a clumsy theory. It's not my favorite. I've got a favorite theory with blushing. You want here it, We'll be that way, Josh, I like I'd love to hear yours. My favorite is n p A. UM. It's it's this obscure uh theory about human personalities, and the theory is that all of them are created based on the foundation of narcissism, perfectionism, and aggression. Right and um, all personalities can be explained through these three um outlooks or views of life. UM. The uh there should be a balance between the three, and the more balanced it is probably the more normal you are. People who have almost just one exclusively tend to be schizophrenic that kind of thing. No, no, no, no, well you know, so with m p A or under the mp A theory, blushing is actually am It is a fight or flight response, but you're actually becoming enraged. You're not embarrassed, your your narcissism has been affronted, right, I gotta tell you, is the narcissist the mp A theory really makes sense to me? Yeah, I felt that way before too. I think the rage a little less or sorry, a little more than the embarrassment, right Yeah, So, I mean maybe we're just confusing it. Who knows. I mean, really, at this point, as far as we know about blushing, you or I could come up with a pretty adequate theory for it, right. Maybe we'll publish one soon, maybe so. But the fact is we all blush. There's no denying that exactly. Now. You can learn more about it on how stuff works dot com by typing why do people blush? Into the search bar and stick around after this message for Chuck's in my top five articles of the month, right after this Stuff you should know is brought to you by Visa.
