Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot com? Yeah, wait your house it's a good y Hey, and welcome to the podcast. This is Josh. That's Chuck. This is Stuffy should know. How do you smell? Chuck? Was that at the other room this morning? So? How how are you holding up? Well? This is we got a good three and a half beat between us. Fine, um, you heard this is a non usual opening for this podcast. You didn't hear, but I heard you did. Okay, Okay, So that's the that's the last few seconds. I guess of the Fly, the original nineteen fifty eight version starring Vincent Price, and that is the the inventor named Seth Brendle, who um brindle fly, Yeah, who has converted himself into a fly. Well switched heads with the fly, right, switched bodies, I guess. And now he's a tiny little fly man who's being attacked by a spider on the spider web. You know, I just saw the Cromeberg version a couple of months ago. I think I told you that. Yeah, it holds up the first time. Yeah, it's that I don't understand why um oh, what is his name, the main guy, gold bloom. I don't understand why Jeff Goldbloom um decided to add I guess it's a kind of like sexy arrogance to his character because it came off weird. That's just the gold he can do, I guess. So, man, the he brings that to everything he does. He's tripping with it. So chuck, we uh. We played that part of the fly not so much because we could, although that was a large part of it, but because we can explain what is on that little fly body. Now, that's right. We've read how flies work, and specifically how house flies work by stuff to blow your mind. Robert Lamb's been popping up a lot lately, hasn't he? Who Robert's work? Yeah? Yeah, good stuff, And he just kind of pops into the cubicles and says, hey, how's it going a lot lately? Yeah? Yeah. The housefly josh, um, if you're if you live in a house and you're flies flying around, you got about a nine chance that that is an actual Musca domestica. Yeah, that's the that's the houseflies name. That's right. There's not some other more exotic name. It is on all um initial appearances, one of the more mundane bugs ever. But it's actually pretty interesting if you ask me, and disgusting because they carry lots of diseases like typhoid, fever and sam and ella and leprosy and cholera. Isn't that crazy? They carry leprosy and testinal worms. Well, I knew that bacteria that can lead to dysentery. I didn't know that they could, Uh, they could carry leprosy, though I didn't either. You know, I always equate leprosy with nudism because they both they both live in colonies. Yeah, I always think of leprosy when I think of lepricy. I think of the Bible, because growing up in churches where I heard about lepro colonies and leprosy and leprity being healed and all that. Exactly have you ever seen the fog the second one? I guess for the fog too? Was there a fog too? I don't know. I mean John Carpenter the original fog, I think, right, this is the remake where the people attacking were lepers who were turned away and now their ghosts have come back for Vengeance. I think that was the original as well. It wasn't. I didn't realize there were lepers. I thought they were like pirates that have been across or something. Cheez. We need to get her act together. And that's such a good movie, the first one. Yeah, I'll check it out. I just watched the thing last night. Oh that's a great one too. Yeah. And I had a fairly voracious Alien versus the Thing comments on I saw people get into that. I definitely say Alien is bad or but the thing is more disgusting, a little more twisted. Yeah, alright, this has been a long setup. Flies huh so chuck, um, We've we've got down that they spread disease, right potentially. Um. One of the things that kind of cropped up while I was reading this is it was kind of an expansion of everything I'd always knew about flies. Yeah, we all know a little bit, which I find very reassuring. You know, it's not like quantum suicide, where it's like everything you think you know is just completely unreal and just go ahead and stop thinking. Now. This is like, yes, you understand house flies, and here is some more information about them. So I guess kind of this is almost like an elementary school episode, which I find I find comforting and reassuring to let's talk about fly anatomy, house fly anatomy, and if I accidentally say fly, if you accidentally say fly, we mean house fly specifically, right, that's right, Oh, And dispersed throughout the podcast, we'll have fly facts that sounds like this, So when you hear that, it's gonna be a new fly fact. So, Josh, if you're talking a housefly body, it's like a lot of insects. It's got an exo skeleton made of kitan, and it's got three sections to the body. You got the head, you got the thorax, you got the abdomen. And as everyone knows, this is the this is actually isn't a fly fact, so no buzz, but it is effect, but it's not one of our fly facts. So every jingle, no jingle. Everyone knows that the fly has all those tiny, little bitty eyes, and like you said, it's reassuring to know that's exactly what they are. There two common eyes divided up into three to six thousand simple eze yes, and it's like a bunch of little video monitors because they can't focus on one little thing in particular. It's like a mosaic, right, but I also got the impression that it's like a mosaic. But each little eye is kind of its own. It's representative of the physical grid. It makes a grid of its physical environment. Right. So I wonder if the flies like, oh, there's a movement in sector, what I wonder and like, I go focus on that one simple eye to see that, you know a piece of poo on the ground that I need to go, you know, wattle through, or there's a human um who's coming towards me or something. And of course by sector ninety G, I meant sector three thousand to six thousand G. Yeah. So those are the eyes, and they are also a couple of little um I think three ocel eyes or if you're in Itali in Italy, and they are between the two compound eyes. And that's sort of like a compass that keep the fly oriented and ideally flying towards the sun. Okay, So I think that this should be the first fly fact. All right, let's do it, okay, uh chuck. The reason house flies are commonly found kind of flittering against a window because they're stupid, No, that's a fly myth. The fly fact is that they're oh ocelli or ocelli. The to simplize the act as a compass orient themselves upward by finding the sunlight. They're all constantly searching for sunlight, which is why they always go to a window or a bugs ever. That was fly back number one, all right, I like it on the head, Josh, which is where a lot of the action takes place with a fly. Um. They get their sense of smell from their antennae right there. For tasting and eating. They have a probiscus, which is a little plunger like thing that sticks out from the bottom of its mouth and I'm sorry, the bottom of the head um. They have little feelers, two of these, and their max maxillary palps. Yeah yeah, and then they are the tasters. And at the end of the probiscus you have the labellum, which is um. Is that the mouth, the little spongey part. Yeah, it's it's like a sponge mouth like it's not like an open mouth that you think of. It's like a sponge on the end of the pro proboscis where you just suck. That's a probiscus didn't they it's close proboscus. Sorry about that. No, it goes either way, and that always makes me think of adaptation. Chris Cooper's character talks about the probiscus of the orchid. Oh yeah, Jerry's and they're just saying, yes, it's really weird. Apparently she's um guest starring in this episode. She's paying attention for the first time in weeks. So, um, chuck, there's a huge, huge little thing that you You pointed out that um uh, the labellum. Yes, the spongy mouth doesn't allow solid food in and we're gonna get to that in a minute, but just keep that in mind. That's fly foreshadowing, not a fly fact. But we've come to what I think is fly fact number two. Don't you are you going with the biting? Yeah, the biting, Okay, fly fact number two. Houseflies do not bite. If you get bitten by a fly, it was not a houseflowd on housewives. Might be a horse fly, and you know those in the summertime when you're in the pool, the land on your head and bite the tar out of you. Or it might have been your little sibling, brothers, sister. That's true and what other list another one stable flies, which are yeah, yeah, horseflies there there. They kind of take care of all the horses at once, where a horse flies just like I just want this one horse. That's my take on it, all right, So that's fly fact too, So chuck, Um, we are onto wings now, which isn't necessarily a fly fact because it's so essential. Right back in ancient times, which was up to sixty million years ago, as I understand, Um, that's how long houseflies have been around. Um, they had two sets, two full sets of wings, and nowadays in our modern times, it looks like flies have houseflies have one set. That's not necessarily true. Yeah, if you're a little jerky kid, a little myoclonic jerk, and you pull the wings off of a fly, you probably think you're just pulling off too. Yeah, and you may be, because those are the large ones. But there's little tiny guys under there, and they're called halters, right, and the halters where actually if you if you pull the halter off, these little tiny wings um that are underneath or above I think they're underneath. They're underneath the big wings um. They allow they basically allow the fly to move quickly in the air right to um to maintain balance a direct direction hover, yes, um. And so if you remove one of these, it can only go in circles. If you remove both of the halters to fly, can't get is an airborne at all? Yeah, with those two big wings, it still can't fly without his little halters. Ye, it's pretty good, but not a fly fact. No, very interesting nonetheless, But the the big wings, the large wings that you see when you look at a fly, are the ones that do the real heavy lifting, right. Yeah, We're talking two hundred to three hundred flaps per second, and they can go about four and a half miles an hour, which I would have assumed they could go faster than I can run four and a half miles an hour. And it's and I've seen flies zipping by me when I'm running. So chuck first, I don't know if you said the all of the moving parts, the wings, the legs, all this stuff, um, are located in the thorax, right, So you get the two sets of wings up top, and then below that you have the different legs. And the legs are well, they're they're standard legs. They're segmented and joined. But the most interesting part for me about the fly legs the house fly legs are the tarsi, right, yes, which are little tiny hairs on the end of the legs that act as pretty much the same thing as taste buds do for us. So that's why a fly um, that's why it'll land on food. It's not just landing, it's tasting to say do I want some of this? And most of the time the answers yes yes. And we'll get to the gruesome truth of that in a moment as well. Right, My favorite part of the legs is the pole vili. They are a little moist suction pads and they are the little grippers. So that's why when you see a fly, uh, jump on a wall, fly into a wall, and just all of a sudden they're like Spider Man right walking up the wall, little grippers. Or that's how Jeff Goldblum did it, with some swad of viv as well thrown in there. Uh. And then the abdomen they have the key organs which are the reproductive organs, and the female the oviposter, and the male has the ideas and I actually look at that one up nice and that's not how it would have pronounced it. But these little uh, little things retract when they're not in use, on both the male and the female, so they'll stay protected there. That's very aerodynamic. It would be very unerodynamic to have the adegus just kind of laughing in the wind flies a thing around the house. It's like putting the landing gear down a little too soon. Write exactly, um, so chuck you you we already foreshadowed what's going on with them. The mouth, the sponge mouth, the labellum. Yes, um, that it can only up liquids. Well, not everything a fly eats is liquid, right, No, not if they want to jump on that steak or that dog crap or dry blood yea. Um. When a fly encounters something, well, first of all, part when when the it accepts food into the bellum, it basically sucks it straight into the stomach. If it's liquid, it's good to go. So when it lands on the food and it finds that it can't um, it can't just suck it up, um, it basically tries to crumble it with the end of its proboscus. Right at that point, it's got tiny little it's it's smaller, it's more manageable, and then it pukes on it. Yea, that's step two. Everything you've ever heard about flies vomiting on you um or your food or whatever when they land is absolutely true. Yeah. I thought I might have thought that was an old wives talle in this article. No, it is true. Um. What the fly does is basically spit up saliva and digestive juice is onto the little crumbs that it's made using its proboscus, right, um, and it sits there for a couple of seconds thinking, and then it it tries to slurp it up. Um. And Robert makes a really good point in the article this sounds extremely disgusting to us, right, sure, but the fly isn't doing anything we don't do. When we take food into our mouth, we chew it, we masticate it. Right. Saliva is attacking it, starting to break it down, and then it goes through our esophagus into our stomachs and it becomes digested by juices. The flyes just doing the same thing, but on the outside of its body because it doesn't have teeth, and we have the decency to keep it all internal. Right, We don't go into restaurants and puke up onto our plate. That just would that would be untoward. So if there if the um, if this food is kind of in an in between state, um, and it's been spent on, vomited on left and it's still not quite right, it gets moved to the crop. Right, Yeah, I see the what should we call this fly fact? Okay? Fly fact? Was this three? Yeah, there's a crop, like you said, and instead of just um saying, oh, well this this little bit of crumb isn't quite liquid enough, let me just go fly to another one, the fly is pretty efficient, so they say, actually, let me save this for later, stick it down another hole into the crop, and in the crop it waits, and then they'll pass it back and forth, maybe add a little more digestive juices, throw up on it a bit more, and they do this until it's ready to be you know, until it's liquid ready to go down the shoot. It doesn't waste its food. That was fly fact three. Right, Yes, there is one thing you know we said that the fly is not really doing anything differently than we do to our food, is just doing it on the outside. That's still horrific and disgusting, because um, not only is the the fly carrying possibly leprosy to your sandwich. When it throws up on it, it's probably throwing up something at just eight which, as you pointed out, could be dog poop, could be blood. Uh, could be the you know, poop from a leprous dog, something like that. So when you you're at a picnic or something and you see that fly on your sandy, it's probably and if you see it moving his little hands around, it's vomiting disease on your food. It's what it's doing, right, exactly, Potentially disease, not always no. And plus you don't underestimate the human immune system. I mean, we all have white blood cells, you know, we all, we all can mount a pretty decent defense unless we have some sort of immuno deficiency. And if we do have that, then they were probably in some sort of treatment for it. So for the most part, I mean, it is gross. But you know, I think in in modern times where we got the flies under control at least you know here in the West. Yes, Um, for now, until the apocalypse comes the Rise of the fly right, Um, do you remember of that part in Amityville Horror The priest is like he's covered in flies and starts sweating and was that Rod Starker Huh yeah, nice good. I would have been so out of there, um chuck. Yes, we talked about their sexy bits already. What do they do with them? What's the fly family? Like a fly family? Josh is like many insect families. They man will chase down a female and impregnate her and it happens really quick. She's ready to lay her eggs. Toot sweet and uh, they don't stick together after they mate, they separate and the and the mother doesn't even guard the eggs like a lot of species do. One night love affair. Yeah, and she basically dumps the eggs and what she deems to be a safe place and she's like, I'm out of here. It's one night stand followed in child abandonment. And how many eggs is it? Later time? Did we get that up to nine? Over the life cycle of a fly? Okay, in a life cycle, I think they said the average lifesman is about three weeks, but it could be three months. Yeah. I don't think a fly can live physically beyond three months. But yeah, the average lifespan and reality because of fly swatters and things like that. Um is like twenty one days. I think he said. Yeah. So the life cycle um is a lot like most insects. It's got the egg and then the larva, then the pupa, then the adult. Warm summertime is optimal. It takes about seven to ten days to go from egg to adult. And they go through I think three molten stages. Uh, the little maggot student, they see, you know this, you know all this. You learn this in school. Didn't it nice to know this? Yeah? Very nice? So chuck um with the maggots. The first stage of the most interesting stage. We've arrived at a story that I have. Oh boy, when I was in college, Um, cooked steak through cooked steak and really actually, now they think about it, I guess I've probably trimmed some raw meat off and put it in the guard bridge can, as is normal, a garbage bag in a garbage can, the kitchen garbage can. Okay, And I get up the next so I'm a normal person. I'm not stick away exactly exactly. Um. So I get up the next morning and I go into the kitchen and I wonder, why is the kitchen floor moving like that? Oh man? And I kind of followed the floor as it went up the garbage can and into it, and I realized that my kitchen floor, it's a small kitchen, granted, but my kitchen floor was covered in a living layer of maggots the whole thing, the whole thing. So I'm like, I've got to get rid of these. What how do you take care of a maggot infestation? And I tried bleach first, did nothing to him, didn't even slow down one of them. Really, I ended up having to walk all over them. Well that, yeah, that's the old fashioned way. That's that's what I had to do. And for I did not actually have a floor infestation after that, so I guess I got them all. But they make a horrific little popping sound. Did you have have like snow shoes or something at least no, probably like hiking boots or something. It was an athen Why were they all over the floor? Was it from the steak it out of the garbage can overnight? Like like that? That's frightening, But that I mean that follows with um what we know about the housefly life cycle. That Larva's hatch um within a day, right, and and don't forget Larva and by Larva's I met larva with an E on the end um equals maggots breathe out of their butt, right, didn't we learn that somewhere else? So they never have to stop eating exactly. So they're just like this little fleshy worm like thing with the hooked mouth that just does nothing but eat. And yeah, because they breathe out of their butts and molt like I said, three stages, and then the third molten stage, you know, it goes uh, it gets a little darker and enters the pupa stage and that's the larger protective shell. Then it fully develops and outcomes a beautiful butterfly or a disgusting house fly like barton the Simpsons. Yeah, and how to like what Barton the senses. There's a treehouse of Horror where they redid the fly where he's like that mindless like the fly with Bart's bodies it's mindless eating. Yeah, that was one of the earlier ones. That's a good one. Uh. And then they get out of their little shell there with a temporary swollen bump because they can't chew to get out of an egg or the shell, so they they literally use this bump on their head to crack their way out, and then after they get out, that bump deflates and it just becomes part of the head again. I wonder if it's unique to each fly, like they can recognize one another from the bump on the head, Like, I don't know, and I didn't There wasn't a name for that in here either. No, it's just the swollen bump alright. Fly fact number four. Yes, so we talked about a fly. It can't live longer than three months, that's right, That is if it's existing outside of diapause, right, Totally fascinating to me. Yes, So diapause is basically like suspended animation or hibernation for the fly. Basically, if there's no food around um, and there's no predators either, and the flies like I'm gonna see what's going on a few months from now, the fly can basically shut down it's it's life processes to the state where it can just exist without moving. It's like a state between life and death for a few months, right, and then wake back up and be like it's the future or it's winter and I'm dead soon. That's another part, because don't they only live during the warmer months or do they don't live all year around. They they thrive in the in the warmer, warm, muggy areas. So Josh, surely these things add nothing to the world aside from being discussing little creeps. Agreed? Not true? You don't want them in your house? Well, remember, Chuck, these are one of the one, one of like three bugs that you and I agreed are are fine to kill. Yeah, what else did we say? Mosquitoes and mosquitoes, ticks and this is the only non blood sucker. Interesting. It's a poop Peter though, and that's why I don't want in your house. But they are good um, like all flies in the world at large, great source of protein. They break things down in in into smaller bits for other bacteria and life forms to feed on. They are an important part of any ecosystem that they live in. I mean, there's nothing here that's useless, right, That's right? Okay. I think they even found a use for the old appendix, didn't they they did? Doesn't it like um combat cancerous growth? I can't remember, I believe so uh, And I think they even use maggots and uh freshwater fishing raising commercial fish like to lapia. Yeah to life, you love them. They use pupa. The pupa is high in protein. Okay, so that's what they feed them, a little freeze dripe pupa m And you know, if you're if you're a survivalist, or you're in a bad situation out in the woods and you need to survive, maggots. If you get like a rotted uh rotted tree on the ground, you want to eat those maggots. You'll eat it. You'll eat it and you'll like it. I would do it. And I'm not down with that stuff at all, but I would do that, of course, to save myself. Full circle and Tom Fagy, oh yeah, nice job, thank you. Do we have time for one more fly fact? I? I think so, I think, yes, we do alright. Fly fact number six, No. Five five. Ancient civilizations actually made regular sacrifices to the fly gods to keep the swarms out of their houses and temples because they thought they were harbingers of harbingers of sickness and death, even though they didn't know the science behind it. Right. The flies are just there's something about them. They are um, They're disgusting there, unwholesome. That's the word I'm looking for. They are inherently unwholesome. Yeah. So if you want to keep flies out of your temple, right, you have several options available to you. Right, keep a clean house, that's number one. That's the smartest thing to do. Don't don't don't leave like your carton of milk open and just sitting on the counter when you're doing it, all right, Or the steak in the trash. Yeah, Emily makes me throw away food. Uh, Like, I put it in a bag and take it out to the garbage. So what we do too, that's what you do with adults in college, I think so. Yeah, it's like scrape in the trash. It was in a kitchen garbage can with the top. I mean in college, I would have left that plate out in the living room on the couch. I've always been fairly clean. Yeah, me too. What else can you do fairly biological control? You've got the old venus fly trap, which you know, if you can keep them healthy either kind of tough. Not just that. At the end of the um at the end of the fly that was at the beginning of this podcast, it's taught in a spider web, which happens quite a bit, so us. As long as the spider is not going to kill you and your family while you're sleeping, just leave it along because it's going to control the fly population tremendously. That's right. And farmers even there's some commercial farms that actually buy uh parasitic wasps too, you know, eat larvae right and take care of flies for their crops. The Tarot melody wasp, that's right, Tara Melody. Uh, keep your windows and door shut. That's kind of obvious. If you're gonna keep your door open in the middle summertime, you're gonna have a lot of flies. I think that's funny that even warranted its own bullet point. Yeah, and the flyswatter did too. Actually physical control and fly paper which is disgusting. Yeah, it's it's gross too, I mean especially around food, like if you see that in the kitchen at camp. Yeah, you know when you went to camp and you walk past of kids and there like flies there. It's like, get some glass glazies windows, what is wrong? Or at least changed the fly paper every day. That's something too. There's bugs appers and then I wouldn't even endorse pesticides for house flies. You don't want to be sprayed that stuff in your house, But that is an option for some people and it's just not for me. They can be very dangerous and has anybody who's ever seen a bug's life knows the bugs appers actually get bugs high. It's kind of like a hallucinogen to him. Oh was that what happened in that? Yeah, I remember the guy that's got zapp, the bug got zapp. He's like, oh, that was far out something along those lines. Yeah, bug zappers are fun. So chuck, you got any more fly fax or anything? I know? So we're done with house flies. I'm done forever. House Flies just just as disgusting as you always thought. That's right, and you already knew everything about him. So everybody yourself a pat on the back of this one. Right. Yeah, we should mention if you use a fly swatter, it's a lot of fun to smash a house fly, but you leave behind quite a disgusting mess. You will not allow house or fly swatters in the house. Now, we don't. We haven't owned up. They're they're really kind of gross. That's only second to the Pooper Scooper for the kiddie lettering devices. Or the toilet scrubber next to the toilet, or the plunger. So that's it. Now you know what chuck's in my houses look like. Right. If you want to know more about flies and you want to see these fly facts in text, even you can type in house flies uh in the handy search bar at how stuff works dot com, which of course brings up listener mail Uh funny or sad funny. Okay, I'm gonna read the Hodgman exchange. Oh oh really, I was thinking we wouldn't do that and end up on Judge John Hodgman. Maybe he'll litigate this if we just pretendally can he doesn't exist. We'll see. I'm gonna read this though, all buddy, Uh Johnny Rocket Hodgeman John Kellogg Hodgman. Rocket is his maiden name. He has a podcast he does through Jesse Thorn's Maximum Fun Sound of Young America, called Judge John Hodgman. We plugged it before he settles minor disputes between friends, lovers, husbands and wives. It's very funny. So John writes this last week, and there is a fan that said I wish to file suit against the stuff. You should know podcasts and this guy. It's complaining about the fact that we said in the Scooby Doo show that there were the Boston area campuses. Yeah, the five the five colleges that were represented by the characters. Supposedly it was one of the Scooby Doo myths, and we said that they're all Boston area colleges. Like, what ones Amherst, you, mass Holyoke? Yeah, Mount Holyoke's North Northampton And all right, that's the ones we'll get too. So March eighteen eight their nine Am, Judge John Hydman writes to the stuff you should know. Seriously, guys, see this Hello, The five colleges are in the Connecticut River or Pioneer Valley of western Massachusetts, specifically Amherst, Northampton in Holyoke, Massachusetts. This is painful to me, not only because this is Hodgman country, but it was which is mainlier than Marble Country. Actually it also has more argyle. That's right. It was indeed while driving up and down the tobacco fields along the Connecticut River that I first came to enjoy your podcasts and to admire your great knowledgeability. Wait you say tobacco fields, that is right. The Connecticut River Valley produces what is historically the most prize shade tobacco in the United States, and Massachusetts tobacco is still dried and used as rappers for fine cigars. Were you aware of this? In all caps? He he loves all cats, and he's very intimidating. Sunday, even hope to show this fine country to you, my semi hometown, in my total home state, and to remind you of the great motto of Hampshire College. To know is not enough. I look forward to hearing this letter read in its entirety on your podcast before you forced me to humiliate you on mine. That is all. Chuck Bryant writes, back, boy, John, did we hear about this one? It made it abundantly clear that the fine people of Massachusetts need to get right with one another and cease to throw up walls between themselves. There's enough segregation in the world. At ten o four, Judge John Hodgman writes, so you have already run a correction, then I must have missed it. Sarcasm uh. Ten o six, Chuck writes, we have not and shall not take part in the continued segregation of the fine people of Massachusetts. That is all. At ten oh eight, John writes, you leave me no choice but to mention this on my own podcast, And I respond to him, and you leave me no choice but to scoff at it publicly on our podcast. This is like a nerd battle at this point. It Yeah, And then John writes, very seriously, you don't want to go down this road, Chuck, just read my letter on the air before this gets ugly. I finally responded, if anything gets read, it shall be the entire exchange, John, complete with your threatening words from the alleged judge. And then he writes back, finally, you are a monster. And that is the end of the exchange. That was a great gramantic reading. Man. Thank you, thank you, and thank you John. Beep beep beep and uh sorry. I guess to everybody who was offended by that, which was a substantial amount of people who wrote in, I guess in Massachusetts, that'd be like saying equating making with Atlanta or something, and we would say, no, no, no, no, Makan's not even close to Atlanta. Yeah, but I don't know if I would um point out the difference angrily. Well, Plus they were disassociating from Boston. Usually you glom onto the big city and they were like, no, no, no, no, no, We're not Boston this one. Yeah, so I don't know. If I don't get it, I don't either. But um to each his own, as we always say, right, that's right. If you want to litigate us somehow via email, maybe you can contact John Hodgman.
