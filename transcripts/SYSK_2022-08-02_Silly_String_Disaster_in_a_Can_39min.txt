Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and Jerry's here and we're silly and this is Stuff you should Know Silly podcast. Boy, did this one just not reek of the Old House Stuff Works days? Yeah? But what's awesome is that you knew that you could just you know, like you didn't have to double check any facts or anything like that, because Tracy Wilson was on the case here and she does not get her facts mixed up. No, this was an Old House Stuff Works article from Tracy and also got some stuff from CNN, Gismoto, a mental floss, the Wired, and Mother Jones, which feels like a veritable greatest hits of Stuff you should Know reference sites that look at it. But we're talking about Silly String. We haven't done one on a classic toy in a long time. It's been too long. And although this isn't quite as interesting as like say a Sea monkey, I think it still has some pretty interesting points. Well, there's a d percent less Nazis in this one, which I like, not one Nazi. So um, Silly String is a toy and it's one of those things that is so ubiquitous and everybody knows about it and may may even be annoyed by it or whatever. That, Um, you don't realize that there's people out there who talk about this stuff and think about this stuff, and that if you start to dive into the Internet and look for those people, uh, and you read what they write, you start to figure out that they're all very, very wrong in whatever they're saying about silly string. Yeah, and I think that was I think, especially at the time Tracy wrote this article, it was one of those deals where everything on the web basically said, and we don't even know what's in silly string, And it's one of those sort of like uh, easy chase. It's like this sort of mystery what's inside the can and science can't even figure it out and all we know is invented by Julius Simon in nineteen sixty nine. And it turns out that none of that stuff stuff is actually true. We do know what's in silly string, and Julius Simon did not invent it. No, And I think here, um, about a minute and a half into the podcast, we should probably tell everybody what silly string is in case they have been in case they haven't heard, living where living outside of a silly string laden country. That's right. Silly string comes in an aerosol can. So if you look at it, it's it might look like easy cheese or a small can of AquaNet. First spray paint. There, spray paint. I was trying to think of like antiquated things, but sure spray paint works as well. Uh. And you press the nozzle and out comes shooting a pressurized stream of this foamy string, and you can It depends on you know, how hard you shake it and your angle of incidents, I guess, or is that right. I've probably got that wrong. The angle in which you shoot it. Sure, angle of attack, angle of attack. But it can travel you know, five six seven up to ten twelve feet, and it's like kind of wet and cold cool feeling when it comes out, comes out very fast and then very quickly kind of um. It doesn't completely dry. It still has sort of that tacky feeling because it will stick to things. But the idea is that it stays in a string form unless you kind of pull it apart. That's what makes silly string fun and great. Yeah, it's not like your grandfather shaving cream that was just foams up in like into this pile, this bubble that kind of grows. It holds its shape, and that's a really important part of it because it wouldn't be a toy if it just came out like shaving cream. No one would want to play with it. It certainly would not have had a very famous uh part of the movie, the great Tom Hanks movie Big, So you've ever seen Big, that's silly string in the scene where he and uh Billy I guess are playing around. All of a sudden, they have all this money and they buy all this garbage, candy and stuff, and they buy silly string, and Tom Hanks acts like he's squirting. It's like snot out of his nose, and they spray silly string. And that's the ideas that kids have a good time with it and parents hate it. Yeah, parents and city council people, as we'll see. And you said another part of it too is not only just its shape, but the fact that it can really travel. You said it can travel up to ten to twelve feet, which for our friends and non imperial countries is a handful of meters um, and that's a lot. You know, like you can be standing pretty far away from somebody, spray them, drop the can, and turn and run, and you still have a pretty good head start on them chasing you. That's right. So the story of Silly String Chuck is actually pretty interesting one. I love ones that like toy that started out as something else, which seems like every toy we've ever talked about. It started, it started life as it's like a different thing, and then somebody was like, actually this is a pretty good toy, and everyone said agreed, and it became a classic toy, and then we podcasted on it sixty years later, that's right, Uh, not quite sixty, but in this case it was. If you look at the actual patent from n seventy two for foamable resinous uh for a foamable resinous composition, you will find Robert Peacox and Leonard A Fish. Fish was an inventor. Cox was a chemist, and what they were trying to originally invent was a medical device kind of an emergency largely battlefield, but an emergency cast that you could spray on like a spray on cast if you break a bone, that would sort of and if you think about silly string in a different application, and if you think about it, what if it instead came out and coated your arm and solidified. That's the idea, and from what I could tell, they were successful in that um. But part of what they were trying to do was find the right nozzle. They they have apparently tested like five hundred nozzles, uh, and one of those nozzles shot this stuff out, this concoction that they came up with in a string uh really far and that string held its shape. So they were like, let's put a button on this particular nozzle. I'm sure Leonard A Fish walked around with it in his little change pocket of his levies for many years. And then when the time was right, they said, we should get back to that because we've got the we've got the spray on cast down. Pat, I think that other thing would make a really good toy, And Robert Peacock said, agreed Leonard Fish, and Leonard Fish nodded silently. That's right. As the legend goes, they did not know anything about toy marketing, obviously, so they made an appointment with who at the time was probably the biggest name in toys in the early seventies, Wammo still a big name in toys, and uh, we covered Frisbees and Yo Yo's, Like the Wammos has made an appearance in a lot of these episodes. Yo Yo's was one of our better episodes if I remember correctly. Yeah, it was a good one. Um. So they went to Wammo, as legend has it, they sprayed the stuff all over the office and the person they were meeting with as well, and they said, get out of here. This stuff is like how dare you? Kind of reaction. And the next day, though apparently, fish got a telegram saying from WAMO saying we need twenty four cans of the stuff as a marketing test stop to stop right there. Uh and the the idea and this sounds very much like a legend, but who knows, it may be true. The idea is that the next day they cleaned it up. But there was one hangy string on a lamp that one of the owners of WAMO saw and picked up and said, what is this stuff? It's it's fantastic. It's like Paul Newman from Hudsucker Proxy. Okay, I haven't seen that one. I guess I don't know. I know I at least started it. Okay. It had to do with the invention of the hula hoop. Okay, yeah, I saw a lot of that, but it was some some Coen Brothers movies are just not for me. Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I like them all, but I get Emily doesn't like a lot of them because they they do mean things to animals and almost every movie. I never noticed that. Yeah, it's a Cohen Brothers thing. Okay, So they basically say, get these guys in here. This stuff is brilliant, and they did, and apparently within a couple of weeks they had a contract with WAMO to license and sell silly string. But that still doesn't explain Julian Simon, right, No, Julian Simon, the guy who is legendarily the person who invented silly string back in nineteen sixty nine, actually does have something to do with silly string. But he came into the picture thirty years after he was reputed too, because in WAMO said we've spent our silly string, We're done with this. Who wants it? And Julius Simon had a company called Julius Simon Limited, which was the parent company of the car Freshener Corporation. How great is that? And car Freshener had a subsidiary, a toy division called Just for Kicks, and Just for Kicks bought the rights to make silly string in and if car Freshener Corporation just rings the slightest, tiniest bell, you might have seen it in really little script on your tree air freshener that is dangling from your rear view mirror. So Julius Simon is the gentleman who holds the patent to the fur tree air freshener. It's amazing, another ubiquitous product I've never owned. Yeah, the same here. I never got into those either. He had he had two patents and one was for the tree shaped air freshener. Another one was, uh the Undressed Nake Lady silhouette air freshener. Those were two pads. Well, I guess he saw it on a mud flap and was like, I think that was the great at an air freshener. Yeah, I've never seen that one, but I can. I would guess it's kind of that mud flappy thing too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel like mud flaps it's either Yosemite Sam saying back off, or it's like silhouette of a naked lady. Yeah, that's your mud flap selection. Um, all right, I think that's good enough for the first segment, which we'll just call history, and in our second segment after the break, we will bore you to tears by talking about the chemical contents of silly stringth That is not true, everybody, So, Chuck, I just want to say before we get started, I want to explain myself when I was saying stop while you were talking about the telegram, I wasn't telling you to stop a telegram. Stop. Yeah, yeah, I have. Have you ever heard the legend behind why people said stop instead of just adding a period? No, but I think this is definitely the episode to put that. Okay, So apparently, if you were sending a telegram, letters were very cheap, but punctuation was expensive, so you actually paid less to spell out the four letters then paying for a period. That's why people had stopped in the middle of their sentences. But the big dumb dumb would say stop exclamation point right, I really mean it period here. That's amazing. What a great little factory to be able to throw out at the next dinner party. It is a factory. It's a tenth of a fact. Oh wait, I might have my wires crossed. I know what you mean. There's probably a couple of listeners who get it. All right, let's dive into a can of silly string, because, uh, what it inside a can of silly string is known generally to the public now, although some of the stuff on the original patent is has had been changed since then, so I think there are some trade secrets. But let's just say it's definitely a liquid inside the can and it becomes the string outside the can because of the stuff that's inside the can. It is very lightweight, and like we said, it does have an adhesive quality. But it's got to be just the right mix that you want it to stick to a lampshade or stick to a wall, or stick to a person's like ears and hair if you're draping it over the room, over them, over the room. But you don't want it to be so sticky that you can't get it off of something. You want to be able to you know, it's got to be cohesive. You want to be able to pull it out and have it kind of generally come in one big ball as you're trying to clean up afterwards. Right, So that's the tension between the adhesiveness of it and the cohesiveness of it. And as long as it's more cohesive, meaning it'll it'll hold its shape when you pull on it um than it is adhesive, So it's it takes less forced to pull it off somebody than it does to take to pull it apart. That's why it's so easily cleaned up because it is a little bit sticky, but not fully sticky, and that that has to do with the genius of some of the stuff that's in it. Yeah, and imagine getting this right is I mean it sounds well, it's about to say it sounds silly, um to to put this much research and thought into a product like this, But if you get it wrong, no one's gonna buy it. If it sticks so bad everything that parents can't clean it up, they're not gonna buy it for their kids. Uh. It's it's kind of genius in a way that they figured like the exact recipe to make it fun for kids, but something that you could generally just sort of pull off and ball up and throw in the trash. Yeah, and Robert Pea Cox and Leonard A. Fish are the people who did spend that time figuring that out. Because you couldn't make an instant cast with the stuff that comes out of a can of silly string. So they had to go back and figure out how to make it, you know, very colorful, how to make it so it didn't stick too much, how it was cohesive, all that stuff, and they did. They managed to come up with the perfect mixture of basically three ingredients, although there's more than three. Um, there's I don't know why everybody says three, but everyone does say three. Three is the magic three. And then some other stuff. So there's a resin, a surfactant, and a propellant, and apparently there's also a solvent which is very important. There's also talc, which is very important, as we'll see. But each one of these things plays a really uh important role in the creation of the silly string. And you know, like you said, it has to be just right or else the whole thing is going the whole enterprise is going to collapse. I've picture doctor Strange Love wheeling into the room all of a sudden mind podcast. Uh So you've got your resin that's gonna form that plastic structure, that exoskeleton of the strand, and an original form on that patent it was an acrylic resin using poly isobutal methacry late. And the resin is like everything else with the silly string, you gotta get it just right. Um, that is the framework of those strands. If you have too much resin, it's not gonna foam like you wanted to foam, and it'd be more like shooting cock at somebody. And I think we can all agree that's no fun. There's no such thing as silly cock. Uh. If you have too little of the stuff, then they're not gonna hold together. And if silly string, I think we agree that if it came out as tiny little foam bullets, it wouldn't be as fun as if it comes out as a big string. But the whole point is is once this thing is propelled into the air, then it forms that shell that if you don't mess with it like, it'll stay there for a while. It's not like it just disappears. Yeah, because of the resin, that plastic structure that it lends to the whole thing. Um, Yeah, if you leave it alone, it can it can survive for weeks basically, I would guess indefinitely. I'm sure it's like how many licks it takes to get to the center of it pop. No one really knows because no one's just left silly string indefinitely, you know, talk about a monster. So the propellant is also really important too for a couple of reasons. Um, whatever propellant they're using is at room temperature and normal sea level pressure UM, which is what it's like outside of the can. It would be a gas, but the contents of an aerosolt can is under so much pressure that it's actually in its liquid state UM. And the propellant when it when it emerges from that can, it essentially boils. It changes from liquid to a gas. And as it does that, because is everything else is mixed up with that propellant. As we'll see, it takes all of those other components there, resid surfactant, the solvent on a wild ride, and they all combined with one another and turned foamy. So again, the structure of the exoskeleton the thing that lends the whole thing, it's initial support, that's the resin. Yeah, and The other thing the propellant does is that it also helps that resin form basically and uh helps sort of create that that foamy exterior because once that propellant is shot out, it evaporates very quickly. Uh if you if you shoot it at a normal distance, if you've ever taken silly string and like shot it into your like a closed palm or a fist or something, it's gonna be different. It's gonna be like a lot more wet because it doesn't have that chance to spread out and quickly evaporate, and it's gonna be a lot more brittle. That's why you're supposed to shoot you know, the propellant across the room. Is it sort of lends itself to doing what it does best. By doing what it does best, you're right, which is propelling things. So um, they used to originally use die chlora flora methane also known as free on twelve and free on twelve is so bad for the ozone layer that there is a global law against manufacturing free on. Like think about how many global laws there are that might be the only one. Um, I guess so, but yeah, this is this is like an actual yeah murder but still, how about like a global regulation maybe okay, sure, or something that has to do with industry you're manufacturing rather than you know, killing people. So so they used to use free on, but you can't use free on anymore. Um. You actually can use it in some applications. There's this a finite stock of free on left on earth, um, and you're allowed to use those. You just can't manufacture anymore. So eventually we'll run out of free on. Um. They had to figure out something else to use, and they did. So. You don't find free on twelve inside of silly string anymore because it's really bad for the ozone layer. That's right. Although as we learned in our research over the years, there have been various UH rogue off brands UH that have used free on that have popped up, like in the two thousands, and I think even in the two thousand tens, they would find some random silly string shipment that came from you know, Taiwan or China that still had that free on twelve in it, and you know, confiscate that stuff quick and get rid of it, right. So UM. One of the other things moving on from the propellant, which again it's really really important stuff. But all of these things are important. Each one plays its own role, and and the surfactant plays a really interesting role too, because it helps the resin foam, it helps the resin expand. And the surfactant does this by um, by the fact that it's ampiphilic and amphiphil. Sorry, it's hydrophobic and it's hydrophilic, so it repels water and it attracts water. It doesn't know what it's doing, but it does both of those things. And in that sense, it actually manages to keep molecules cohesive, so it lends it it's cohesive um property um. It also lends it a little bit of stickiness, but I saw that it keeps it from being too sticky. So this is like the surfactan is just a wonder chemical because it's doing the opposite at the same time. Yeah, and the surfactant is uh, like Tracy says, you know, so many years ago in this article that it's just sort of a fancy name for a detergent. And the idea is if you think about like, um, like if you have a sink full of water and you just squirt some soap, like dish soap, in there. It's just gonna sort of sit there, and you might not even know there's any soap in there until you turn on that uh that high pressure from the sink and maybe even put your finger over it. Then that stuff's gonna foam up all of a sudden. And that's sort of what's going on with this can of silly string, right, And originally on the patent they listed the surfactan as sorbitan trioliate, which has a trade name of get this tween five tween. Yeah, that's weird. It sounds like a super weird. Yeah, that sounds like a an Internet name for a predator. It does, for sure. But it's also one of those things that's like so innocuous that it almost makes you wonder if they went to great links to come up with something. You just look right past, you know, uh as far um as far as how much of this stuff is in there? Of what stuff is in there, um, the resin is about ten to fiftent. Surfactin is actually less than five percent. Most of what's in that can as that propellant. So if you had a see through can of silly string, it would be mostly that liquid propellant. Well, I guess it's all liquid at the time until it comes out like we said, um, but mostly propellant. But you did mention talc in there. I think without the talc it would it wouldn't have much body to it. Is that the idea? Yeah, it would, it would. I can't even imagine it will be like, yeah, just be like kind of flucky plastic e exoskeleton without it the foam, I guess is what what I saw. And I also saw get this, so I've been doing a little bit of sleuthing. Tween eighty five is actually used as an emulsifier for mixing mineral oil with other stuff in other applications, So I believe that tween eighty five serves a double duty as a surfactant but also an emulsifier for the talc as well. Oh okay, okay, did you just do that on the fly? I mean when I was researching it. Okay, it sounded in the moment. No, I mean I don't walk around knowing other industrial uses for tween eighty five that he just happened to look it up or something. No, no, no, no, I looked it up and wrote it down. I was like, this is juicy I can't leave this one out. It's pretty juicy. You also have h anytime you have something like this, you're gonna need a stabilizer. And in this case they use ammonia and is a prop alcohol And uh, I think the ammonia keeps it from corroding inside the can, and the alcohol stops bugs basically like stars life from forming. Right. I didn't find that anywhere else on the entire Internet. I looked in every single corner. I didn't find it, not only in relation to to silly string, but in relation to aerosol cans in general. Like, I have no idea where that came from, but I did some more sleuthing. Oh boy, that was from the Wired article. Right, maybe I think so? Actually, yeah, but I just don't understand what they're talking about. Um, I mean it makes sense, but I just haven't seen it anywhere else. But a propol alcohol is also commonly used as a solvent, So the unnamed solvent might actually be named. They might have all the ingredients listed here, but they're just not saying this thing is also as well. Yeah, a little bit of sleight of hand and what's it called misguidance? Uh, misdirection yeah, yeah, misdirection, that's right, misguid Yeah, you'd be a heck of a magician. I'm misguiding you. Everyone's like what, I don't think you're supposed an outst either, right, that's right, man, I would be terrible at this. If you think the coin would fall out of my knuckles. If you look at my right hand and not my left, you will notice miss guidance. All right? Is that Does that cover the ingredients? Oh? Just one more thing, No, I guess we already talked about it about how like the um, the aerosol um, the propellant boils and carries everything else out on it. And if you're just like, man, I need more, tell me more about the manufacturing of aerosol cans. But you're in luck because we actually did an entire episode on aerosol cans before, did we Really? That sounded familiar. That's an old one. Huh. Yeah. I was back and we were just casting about at the time, obviously, but if I remor correctly, we we did it. It was done. You know. When when we were finished, we were casting about trying to sell Toyota cameras. That's right, the two thou twelve camera are you ready alight, let's take that break. I'm gonna go fire up the camera and get the A C going because it's hot here. I'm ready to leave, and we'll talk about some interesting other uses in the environmental impact right after this. I can just see that two thousand twelve camera in your driveway with like the the ceiling liner kind of hanging down a little bit like it it came undone in one spot and it just kept going from those ceiling liners last forever. They sure do way beyond. I like the idea that people actually might think that they gave us like cameras right around. No, it's true. I mean seriously, there's still old episodes that had that that that ad embedded in. It's hilariousing that then won't go away. They really got their money's worth out of that one, Yes, and still do. One of the interesting uses of uh silly string popped up during in the War and a Rock when the US military, although they didn't officially endorse it and like buy this stuff for the troops, which I'm not sure why they wouldn't. Um they would use them to find I E. D s and trip wires, so they would like go up to like the doorway of a room and they would spray silly string around and see if they were if it hung on invisible trip wires, not invisible but you know, hard to see trip wires, Yeah, which is really awesome. It's kind of like Katherine Zeta Jones spraying that powder or whatever in that one movie. Um, I can't remember that. I don't remember Tom's kind of Affair. Maybe it was the one with Sean Connery. I can't remember the name of it, but um, it was just yeah, nineties dumb movie. But yeah, same thing, but using silly string in in in a rock taking out i e. D s rather than trying to steal a diamond or something. That's for some differences, but it's the same principle. Yeah. And there was a kind of a cool story from two thousand seven when a I think a soldier's mother in New Jersey. Uh, they were they wanted to get their hands on some of this stuff, and so she mounted a drive and collected about eighty thousand kinds of silly string to send to the troops. I think the sort of bummer ending in that story as she had trouble getting it shipped or something and I think a lot of it went bad. I never saw anytime there's like not a great follow up. It's probably not a great ending, right, or the media just got bored with it. Yeah, they're like, we're really, can we just write a listical again? I've got it now, chuck the two thousand and twelve camera, it's ready. Are you ready now? I still don't have it. Uh So if you heard us listing all these ingredients, even though free untwelve isn't in there anymore, you might think that it's probably um not something that's great for the environment. Uh And like you said, in the seventies and eighties, kind of right as this was being born, they immediately were uh started a um get rid of CFCs and hc fcs. Hydro chloro flora carbon's the greatest named carbons of all. Yeah, there's a lot of letters in that word. One of the problems was that they replaced um hydro chlora flora carbons with just plain old hydrofloora carbons, so you can tell fewer letters. Obviously, it's not nearly as dangerous. Right. The thing is, they're they're fine for the ozone layer. They basically do nothing for the ozone layer but keep it in place. So that's good. But they're finding that they also have a high global warming potential. So like any chemical that can enter the atmosphere, it can be given a global warming potential, and the lower the number, the less effective will have on changing the climate. The higher the number, the more greenhouse gas it is. And some of these h f c s are kind of high greenhouse gases. They have a high global warming potential, so we still need to keep figuring out how to get aerosols out. Yeah, I kind of had that feeling. I'm glad you look that up, because my feeling was like, surely they didn't solve that to where this is just like great and not a problem. And I imagine if even though we didn't see the ammonia in anywhere else on the internet, it can't be great to be squirting out something with ammonia everywhere, right, I don't know, I really don't know, and I know that, so, No, it wasn't the ammonia that I didn't see. I didn't see people putting ice aprople alcohol in an aerosol can to keep things from growing inside of it. That's what I didn't see. Okay, people do use ammonia. Yeah. Here's what I will say though, is that, UM, I haven't looked at a can in a while, and I don't know what warnings come on it, but I bet one of them should be like don't let your pets eat it and that kind of thing, or don't let humans or your little sister eat it. Yeah. Well also, yeah, that's just good advice. UM. There's also you can find some um warnings depending on what UM what kind of propellant is used in the can, UM to say, hey, uh, this is flammable, don't spray it to it camp fire, although it will look really awesome, because that's really dangerous. Another one is um it can freeze. It can like basically freeze your skin. And the reason why is because when that um compressed liquid is converting into a gas undergoing a phase change, part of that phase changes that it's it's drawing heat from any available immediate source that includes the can. So it turns the cant ice cold because it takes all the heat out of it to to help turn that um, that gas or that liquid into a gas. I did something kind of dumb a number of years ago, I you know, I have these little skin tags and I would go to the dermatologist to get them clipped. And then I thought, you know what, I'm just gonna buy some of that freeze spray and I'm gonna freeze and clip on myself because that's gotta be easy. And I got some of that spray, and I guess the idea is that it's not for that purpose, and you spray kind of from a distance to to maybe numb something. And I got it right up on that thing and sprayed it and it burned like the fires of hell. It hurts so bad. It felt like someone pressed a hot, like glowing piece of metal into my skin. I can imagine. I know where you're coming from, actually, because I went through a phase when I was a tween eighty five weirdly enough about in eighty five um and uh, where I had warts, especially on my elbows for some reason, and I had to go to the doctor like every couple of months and they would burn them off with liquid liquid nitrogen frozen nitrogen um. And yeah, if they missed even a little bit, it would really hurt. It was really damaging. But if they just got it on the work, which they normally did. It was weird. There was like no sensation whatsoever. I we should do a shorty on words. Sure, I don't know. That might be our At least listened to episode you'd think, yeah, I think so, even even less than ariosol Canes, that's right, or our poop centric episodes. People love those. Can we finish this one? The two thousand twelve camera? Who's up for one? I don't think that was it either. So the last thing will say is that we mentioned earlier about city council people. Uh, it has been banned here and there because it's such a pain. And uh, in the mid two thousand's, I think two thousand four, there was a city council person named Tom la Bonga in Los Angeles. You know, Hollywood just goes crazy on Halloween. There's like a lot of party in and right there in central Hollywood. And apparently the silly string was out of hand with people spraying it, with people getting on fights from getting sprayed with it, and that they actually put a price tag on that that said silly string remediation was costing the city of Los Angeles two hundred more than two hundred thousand dollars each year from that one night just from Halloween. So they said no more. Uh, not on Halloween, not in l A. Yeah, some fat cat silly string cleaner upper was making two d k on November one every year, so so they they actually passed an ordinance where silly string is outlawed one day a year Halloween in Los Angeles. Um, at the very least in Hollywood. And I did not go back and find out if there had been any change to this law. So let's talk about it as a potential if that existed at least in the past, if not currently, right, because there's because Tracy says that, um, these sanctions are even worse than a pot charge, and I don't think you can get charged for pot anymore in California, right, No, it's legal, right, Okay, So this fine of just carrying a can of silly string could get you a misdemeanor, a thousand dollar fine and up to six months in jail in in l A. Which is like a pretty glamorous jail, but it's still jail for six months. Yeah. They put it on par at the time, at least uh with um like a drunken disorderly charge bicycling or hunting while drunk was two fifty and respectively. Uh find hunting will drunk did not know that? Well, No, And I mean like each of those separately, it makes a lot of sense, but if you put them together, that's when it starts to get hilarious. You could have broken into the l A zoo and gotten a mirror two hundred and fifty dollar fine. If you had a can of silly string, it was a thousand. Did you see the video recently of that poor dog who got into a guerrilla enclosure. He was so scared and the gorillas weren't happy that he was there either, but he did not want to be in there, and um, when they finally got him out animal control got him out, he had like the guiltiest look on his face, like I'm sorry, I didn't want to go in there, but it just happened. He got out. Yeah, everybody was safe. It worked out very well. But yeah, he was really nervous and not happy. No one was. I guess you wouldn't be telling that story like, oh man, I got mauled into a million pieces. Yeah, he looks like a two thousand twelve camera now very nice full circle. Do you got anything else? No, just the rule of threes accomplished that. I think that was four or five tween eighty five words more than three as well, we're failing. Yeah, we're screwing it up left and right. Since I said we're screwing it up left and right, everybody, obviously it's time for listener mail. I'm gonna read this just because it's just a nice person saying thank you. We don't do these much, and we get to also answer a question. Hey, guys, want to write not about a specific episode, but rather to comment on your overall series. I've been listening for years now and continue to find episodes delightfully upbeat, informative, and extremely respectful of different viewpoints. Uh. The chemistry that you two have with each other as apparent to the listener through the silly banter and fun tangents. I love how one of you can say something like you know that thing, and the other one can name exactly what he means. I also have to say that I crack up just about every time Josh says well, since Chuck said blank, it's time for a listener mail. There's no rhyme or reason to the transitional phrase, and it up makes it all the better when you say it, I like that too, if that's one of the nice traditions here. Definitely, as a lifelong learner, your work on this podcast seems to be a dream job. It is. Uh, then I didn't mean that as a question. It is. Uh. You get to research an immense range of topics and you make them so accessible to the audience. Uh, something I appreciate as a teacher. Also applaud you for doing such a thorough job at being diligent with and mindful of your sources. That such a teach your word. Yeah, Uh what diligent h Yeah, Uh, one thing I always look forward to, as well as the fun musical interludes going in and out at the commercial breaks.
