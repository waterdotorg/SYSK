Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant with this Atlanta Braves hat. How's it going, slugger? Yeah? Four braves? Oh yeah. The Yankees are doing terribly too. Yeah, it's a great way to start the season. Yeah, but at the same time, it's like, oh and four out of what a hundred and eighty nine. It's not like they don't have time to come back and six. But yeah, no, of course there's an a big deal. But you never want to start out like that. No, you really don't. But, as the GM pointed out in an article in Atlanta Magazine, still a lot of games to play. Uh. There, it's a rebuilding season. So they fired somebody, right, yeah, oh yeah. He basically said, like, if you're a fan, don't I hope go read it. Okay, I'm not kid. Even if that were true, they jams don't say that. He said it. He sounds like a straight shooter, right, Maybe he was drunk when he did this interview. I don't know, but that's what that's how I read it. And Matt Arnett's in it too, is a picture of him in front of the grocery. Oh really mad, So I guess we should stop talking like we're not being recorded right now. Um, chuck, uh, this is stuff you should know, as you know. And I propose that we begin in earnest now, so chuck back in. There was a guy, an entomologist who he's not an entomologist, but he did coin a term in an editorial that he wrote for the Journal of Insect Conservation. The guy's name is Michael Samways, and the term he coined is the homage scene. Okay, and the homage scene is this word that describes basically the um sweeping similarity and homogeneity that's come about around the planet um since the age of exploration. It's the reason why you have chili peppers as one of the basis of Thai cooking, even though chili peppers are from meso America, tomatoes from meso America from the basis of Italian cooking. Um. It's the reason why there are black people and white people in the United States. It's the reason why there's Asians in Mexican. In Mexico, it's the reason why the Irish uh entered a famine because they became too reliant on the potato, which is actually from the Andes. And it's the reason why there's old navy stores on every continent, well probably except maybe Antarctica, but I wouldn't be willing to bet too much against that. But the homogescene is this age that we're living in now where biologically it's like the earthworms in Minnesota. They're really from Europe, but they're destroying forests in Minnesota. It's all of this coupling together what um A geographer named Alfred Crosby called umu re stitching the seams of Pangaea, the super continent back together once again. And then one of my heroes, Charles c. Man, it's the basis of his book the follow up in f called It's all about the homogen scene. And like the world that Columbus inadvertently created, the big global stew thank you. Um So a lot of people attributed to Columbus, but you really need to go a little further back and you can place the responsibility for the homoges scene. The good, the bad, the ugly, the everything at the feet pretty much of one guy and Ottoman Sultan named Member the Second, who kind of changed the course of history when he overtook Constantinople. That was a pretty good intro. You just did like a many jazz hands that they were trembling. Yeah, you like try to stop yourself. Uh yeah. Age of Exploration. It was kicked off by Member the Second, Yeah, because he basically shut down UM trade routes through the Middle East. Yeah, the Silk Roads, the famous Silk Roads, which was huge. Well yeah, I mean think about it, like Europe got everything from the Middle East, or from Asia through the through the India, through Turkey, through the subcontinent UM. And this guy took control of Constantinople and effectively said, you know what, I'm kind of tired of your crusades, so any Europeans are barred from taking part in this trade. And that was that. That was huge because then they had to take to the sea. Yeah, but think about it, within like fifty years, all of a sudden they were like, okay, well let's just sail and see what happens. Yeah, and that changed everything. Well, did that kick off the age of expression? That that act is what made people say I'm gonna go get in my frigate exactly and just say frigate out of here. Sorry. Then the word play today is world class. Uh, yes, Josh, So they and I also found it interesting that it seems like almost every great discovery that happened because of that was in a big accident. Yeah, these dudes didn't know where they were. No, Well, Columbus cologne, Crystal Ball cologne is apparently how he would have what he would have answered to Well, and then later on Hudson was like, oops, I found Manhattan. Yeah, but that's not what I was looking for. Well, they were failing again and again and again. Ultimately what they were looking for was a passageway to China. Um, and they found it in Panama. But even then they were like still a little too wide and a little too far. But um, but yes, it was very accident. Um. Except Vasco da Gama was one of the few success stories and one of the earliest two, and he kind of cemented the Portuguese control over this because um, there the the West Indies, like what we now refer to as like Indonesia, the Indian subcontinent, Australasia. Basically, Um, that was the place where we wanted to get to. The Europeans wanted to get to, but they couldn't do it overland any longer. Well, the Gama sailed down around Africa, past the Cape of Good Hope and up to India and came back and said, Okay, Portugal owns the world now, And they kind of did as far as being the dominant traders of the of the time, at least for the for pretty much the whole sixteenth century. UM in Europe, of course wouldn't have that. So the Dutch and the English, you know, ponied up, and well ponied up means they paid. They manned up, I guess, and said, you know what, we gotta get on the on the scene here because Portugal is kicking her butt in the spice trade. And I looked up the whole spice thing just to get a little more into it, because I was like, why we're spices such a big deal. Well, he who controls the spice controls the universe. Well, it was kind of true. Back then, UM, spices were were a huge deal because uh one, Europe didn't have these exotic spices because they didn't grow there. They had they had the head garlic, the head onion, and they had like horzerdish. That's about it. So all of a sudden, these exotic spices, uh, come come, come around, and it makes crappy meat tastes better, It makes spoiled meat taste edible, and other bad foods that have gone bad. Yeah, gruel just spice the crap out of it. And um, it was expensive, so it became like a sign of nobility. So like if you were entertaining and you were like either noble or wealthy, you would like really turn it on to your guest if you like brought out the spice tray like along with the meal that's already spiced, and they would just sample different little spices and it was like a really big thing. And then top it all off, it was served by a captured human being wearing like bright feathers, so you could really show off for your guest's Uh. Spice is also improved health. They were used medicinally to treat dozens of maladies. Well, let's get to the star of this episode. Preserved meats not there yet. Oh sorry, well salt, yeah, how we get j Yeah, salt was so valuable they like hit it in the Tower of London. Oh yeah, I think they called it the Salt Tower even for a little while, not officially. And then peppercorn evidently was one of the most valued. It was like a really huge deal you had pink peppercorn. Yeah. Plus it's not cheap pepper even to this day. But they would actually use peppercorn as rent in areas where like there didn't have money, so they would use this currency and like paid peppercorn rent to your landlord. In the background, somebody shouting, bring out, you're dead and you're paying your rent and peppercorn. So that's that's a primer on why it's such a big eel to get spices back in the day. Well. Plus also ultimately the reason why people were doing everything and anything like memos shut down. Um, the silk rows in fourteen fifty three, Columbus sets sail in fourteen Yeah, so in less than forty years. Um, like we're like, okay, we have to figure this out. But I think the big driver of it always money. Sure, there was a merchant class that could make money from selling this stuff to the nobility. That's right there, you have it. There you have it. So where were we Portugal ruling the spice trade, um. And then the Dutch are like, we gotta put a stop to this. We need to go form a corporation chartered company, one of the world's first. I'm gonna butcher this. It's Dutch man. I mean, that's hard to say. The ver Verinigdish Indiese Company or the Dutch East India Company in English, the VSC, which is probably what we'll call it, or we if we refer to the Dutch, that's what we're talking about, because they were representative of the Dutch government. It was a government establishing government um initially funded company that the the Dutch came about and said, hey, Portugal, you're not the only guys on the map now. And then shortly after that the English said, the English said, you know what, We're going to form the East India Company, which, by the way, we should do an episode on just itself. And it was brutal, just the crazy stuff that the East India Company did, killing him the name of spice. Yes, and the Dutch did too. We'll see pretty much everybody did. Your Europeans were brutal, um. But uh so the E i C. The East India Company or the the English um and the Dutch suddenly hit the scene and gave Portugal a run for its money and basically rested control away from Portugal and started dividing it between themselves. That's the scene in the West Indies, that's right. And then they all said, hey, let's go west and check out what kind of fur is being traded. I'm sorry, that's the scene in the East Indies. Would you say West Indies? Yeah? Yeah, um, nice catch. So they the v O C in the E I C England, in Holland, let's call it okay, or we're calling the Dutch, or maybe we should just say that from Amsterdame. Okay, they're all the same. Jerry's laughing. Let's call it the the Netherlands. Everyone in rotter Damn is really mad at you right now, Um Rodder. Name is very nice. Actually, I would imagine I think all of it, all of the Netherlands are nice, lovely, lovely country. Um okay. So uh so they both say, let's go check out the New World because there's gotta be some fur there, and let's do it. Let's let's beat the Portuguese over there. Let's do it, I mean not together in a charter. Yeah, um, we can do it, right. So yeah, now they were competing. They didn't do anything together. It was all competition. There's a competition in the east for the Spice Islands, and now there's a competition in the west and specifically in the um northeastern what is now the northeastern United States. And the whole thing began with um like you were poking fun at Henry Hudson who tried to look for a northeast passage to China for the Dutch. Though that was I was on his own. He was an English explorer. I thought was the northeast. Then the said, hey, while you're up there, look for a northwest passage. Try that one and we'll pay you. Now here's what I was curious about. Was he like a trader to his country for doing this or was it just like all bets are off when you're hired. I think it was you. Well, Christobal Cologne was I think he was Portuguese. No, he was Genoese. He was Italian and he was exploring for um, the Spanish when he landed on Hispaniola. So yeah, it was I think whoever whoever would pay for your expedition. And yeah, so Henry Hudson, I don't believe I've ever heard him considered a trader for that. But he basically contracted out with the Dutch. That's right, the V O C. And he didn't find that Northwest passage, but he did discover, um, the Hudson River. He did. It wasn't called that until he found it Long Island in another place called Manhattan. And now we get to the crux of our story because the Dutch are aware that there's a place called Manhattan and they want to check it out because it has awesome street food. He uh, he did little trading there initially, and that's how he kind of established for the Dutch was by taking part in some commerce. Yeah, because first, um, we're fairly lucrative. There were nothing compared to spices, but they were enough to like get an interest for nothing compared to peppercorn because we were lousy with animals at the time. Yeah, like we didn't know what we're doing. Just kill them all and the fur is easy to come by. Peppercorn though, doesn't grow here. All right, you're ready, I'm ready, okay, so uh he uh he claims it for the Dutch. The States General of the Netherlands set up the Dutch West India Company after this you know revelation that they have you know, trading partners over there, that's right, And it became New Netherland, not New Belgium, not New or New Amsterdam. Yeah, new New Amsterdam is New York exactly. New Netherlands is the area around New York. Yeah, specifically, I think New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Um, Delaware and parts of Pennsylvanian and Rhode Island like a lot a lot of area. So the the Dutch West India Company sends a bunch of Dutch people the colonize and start hanging out, uh, kind of making friends with the local Indians, the lenape Algonquin Lennapee tribe. So I also read that there were Delaware, the Meadowak, and the Wappinger were all there or whoppinger, Um, we're all in the area as well. Um, So the Dutch are like hanging out around these people are the new guys, and they're talking here there. And within five years the director himself of the v o C, Peter Minuit, shows up and he's basically just coming to check on this newly established colony, and while he's there, one of the things he does is um try to establish claim for the Dutch of Manhattan by buying it from the local tribe. Yeah. Well, at first, so the Indians are all like, we don't, we don't trade land and air and water. That's that's for everyone to use. And then the Dutch, we don't understand that. The Dutch said, have you tried liquor? And composedly suppose this is what Jay McGrath says. She's pretty good at history generally. I just looked at that. I couldn't find the liquor. I couldn't find any other great sources for that. So according to this article, um, the Dutch said, hey guys, let's um, let's partake in some liquor, and the Indians on the island drank it with them and got really drunk. And that's where the name Mannhattan supposedly comes from, which I guess it would be in an algonquin tongue because that's what everybody spoke up there. But it was Manna hatch Tannian and the hatch tani, which means the place we all got drunk. Yeah, that's where Manhattan comes from. Supposedly that's the legend. Well that's what they say. The Dutch trans translated that into Mannahatta and then that eventually became Manhattan. Right, So the Dutch are there, Peter Minuit's there, and he's like, you know what, it's just let's see what we can do and let's try to buy this um. Like you said that, the Indians at the time, supposedly nowhere in in the New World um understood or believed in the concept of owning land. So the idea of an Indian saying I will see this land to you you you have to also follow that up at the image of them turning around and laughing to his friends. Right, And not only that, apparently Manhattan wasn't um inhabited. It was a place where they hunted and fished and kind of hung out sometimes. But apparently no local tribe lived on Manhattan, so which made the idea of one of them selling it to them even funnier. And no one knows which which group the Dutch um bought this from. The only record of this this transaction ever taking place was a letter written by Peter Minuit, who just mentions offhand, Um the next year that oh, yeah, we bought Manhattan for a chest of of stuff for sixty guilders. Yeah, that's the old rumor two dollars bought Manhattan, and that's you know, been disputed here and there. Um, well, the sixty guilders is what he wrote that he spent. He spent for Manhattan. But how much that was worth at the time, Like you said, a lot of people said twenty four dollars. They've seen a thousand. It wasn't much, right. Um. I did a little more reading on this too, and it's because you know, of course, the person you think is boy, the Native Americans got rooked out of Manhattan and who knew at the time, But like you said, they didn't even own it, so they sort of pulled a fast one. And in the end, I think most historians think that neither party really fully even understood the terms of the sale. And it wasn't like, oh my gosh, we have these trinkets now. It was hey, we've got some potential military partners, and the Dutch were like, hey, we've got some potential trade partners. So it was a lot more. It a lot more than the sixty guilders right, and even the trinkets, like you mentioned, that's under dispute as well. They they it's all. It's also in addition to the twenty four dollars, which is estimated in the nineteenth century, is kind of a way to make the Indians look like idiots. UM saying that it was just a box of trinkets makes it sound like he makes them sound even dumber. But probably what it was where like axes, metal kettles, UM, scissors, just stuff like the Indians just technology. They didn't have them cutting in so UM. The I guess the idea that the man that the Indians selling Manhattan for two dollars is um false at the very least, it's it's been um taken out of context. But what we have here, I think what you're saying is that there's two parties, neither of which are in any um position to sell or buy this land, who do just that UM. And the sale of Brooklyn actually is a lot better re recorded. There's it's a lot better documented UM. From sixteen thirty six to six eighty four, over like twenty two treaties the local Um tribes sold Manhattan or Brooklyn piece by piece like what amounted to like twelve thousand guilders over time. And um historians now see that as the Indians kind of figuring out that if you sold this land that you didn't even think you owned to the Europeans, it was a way of staving off your eventual removal, and that they were basically doing it. They kind of mastered, like pawning the Europeans, so they were on views of land, they weren't the rubes that they're painted to be. Oftentimes. I think that's the point here. Yeah, I like that. Okay, they said, check out park Slope. Can you imagine the baby carriages one day and the young yuppiece who will be living here are they're still yuppies if not in name and practice. Yeah. Um. So the long story short is that the Dutch now believed that they own Manhattan and New Netherlands in short order, like by the end of the seventeenth century, they own what's now New York, New Jersey in Connecticut, right, that's right. At the same time, back east in the East Indies, things are starting to heat up, specifically around what I said earlier is the star of this episode. This as far as spices go nutmeg. Uh. Nutmeg was very valuable. It tasted yummy when sprinkled on puddings and desserts. And uh it was an approdisiac. Supposedly it was hallucinogenic. Uh powder it's an abort of fashion, which means it can cause abortions. Really, so if you're pregnant, you were supposed to touch nutmeg. Interesting, I didn't done that. Yeah. Uh. And during the Black Plague, they would wear nutmeg around their neck. And if you think that sounds a little inky, it might have actually kept the fleas away that carried the Black plague, so it may not have been simply superstition, right, So they were kind of smart. Plus again we get to what what really drove people the mark up big time. They they some traders marked it up as much as six thousand percent. That's a lot of profit which would make people go crazy for it, which is what the Dutch did. That's right. And at the time, up until about the mid nineteenth century, the only place you could find this stuff was in the Banda Islands in Indonesia group of islands got this nutmeg. This one island in particular, uh Powella Run, which they called run yeah, that one was lousy with us. It's one of the smallest islands of the Banda Islands, but it was like just covered in nutmeg. And there's how many, I think five islands to the band is and um four were controlled by the Dutch clearly out right, and then one was controlled by the British. And the Dutch um landed on the band Islands and kicked the Portuguese out. It did their little treaty thing with the locals, which they like to do. The locals said, okay, thanks for the money. I don't know what you're talking about, and proceeded to trade with other people. Well, yeah, they wanted to establish the monopoly the Dutch did. Yeah, they're saying like we want to be the only exporter of nutmeg, right, you can only sell to us. And then here signed this. But the locals did. They had no idea what what was going on, and they didn't understand this concept or they just didn't really care if the Dutch wanted a monopoly or not. So long story short, the Dutch brutalized the Banda natives. Um Uh carried out like raids and massacres of villages, executed chiefs, basically um wipe themselves out of the local population that was capable of growing nutmegs, so they had to import colonists from the Netherlands to come grow the nutmeg. That's right. But they had their monopoly, well almost the monopoly, because the British still had the control of run um. And like you said, even though it was small, it was lousy with with nutmeg. It's so crazy that nutmeg was like the reason all this was going on. I've got like four whole nutmeg nuts in my pantry right now and it's like nothing to men to see my pants. I didn't understand that. It's like, what's that good for? I just have one in my pocket, gets rid of police. Uh alright, So the Dutch um you were saying, they didn't quite have a monopoly because the British had a run. Exactly, the British had run so uh, they would dip um. They would dip the nutmeg and lime the dutch wood, which would mean it can't grow like if you planet. Yeah, because think about it, if you're exporting nutmeg, it's the fruit the mast of the nutmeg tree, which means it's also the seed, which any smart person could take that, put it in the ground in a similar climate and grow nutmeg, and then all of a sudden, the Dutch doesn't The Dutch don't have that monopoly any longer, so they very ingeniously dipped it in line. That was that jerk move. It is a jerk move, but it's a good way to control that's true. But it didn't quite work because somebody decided, one of the higher ups that we need to partner up with England here instead of trying to like war them out of business with a nutmeg, let's partner up um. In sixteen nineteen they signed a cooperation agreement, but there was a commander of the v o C Yahn Pierre Soon Cohen, who said, screw that and screw your agreement. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna burn down all the nutmeg treats. Yeah, he seems like a very vindictive kind of guy, like he wanted the British out. He wanted the Band Islands just under Dutch control so badly that even after his the higher up said well, we're cool with the British, he was like, no, no, you know what, I'm just gonna burn the whole island down. That's all right, he was crazy, he was yeah. Uh. So fast forward to the Second Anglo Dutch War. The Dutch finally get control of Run Yeah in sixteen sixty six. And then right after that they the Dutch in the English, said all right, things are a little out of hand, right now, let's end this war with the treaty, Yeah, very appropriately named Treaty of Bretta. Well back up a little bit before this. In sixteen sixty we need to point out what's going on back in Manhattan. England took control of Manhattan pretty much by sailing four ships into the harbor, and because the fur trade wasn't as lucrative as they thought it was gonna be, the West India Company from uh Holland said, you know, we're not so concerned about that area, so we're not going to fortify it too much. We're not gonna send him a lot of ammo. So basically, when the English showed up in sixteen four and said surrender, they went, okay, like, will surrender because the Dutch are, you know, Motherland kind of forgot about us over here. They don't care about us, and so come on, it's yours. And by this time also they'd formed the first brewery, remember blocking Christiansen, So they were just getting drunk. Yeah, They're like come on, and and of course England was like sweet yeah, um, so thank you for that. By the way, um, the the Dutch in the English after what was the war that that was the Second Anglo Dutch War, second of three, I think, and in the Treaty of Breta um between the Dutch and the English um settled. A lot of disputes ended that war, but they had disputes in the in the West Indies. So this way the Dutch had all of the in the East Indies had all of the band Islands. Um. The There was a lot of skirmishes between the Dutch and the English in Surinam over cocoa and sugar plantations. And finally, in the Treaty of Bretta, which was very much in the duchess favor, the English ended up with Manhattan. They said, you just had that, You're already there and it was kind of um, as man puts it in was kind of a booby prize, like you know. The English were like, if you can keep that, it's all right, and like no, no, we want you to have it. We're so grateful for the for the islands and for Surinam. You keep Manhattan, and today the Olsen twins lived there, at least one of them does. Uh. So in the end, England kept Manhattan, which they kind of already had. The Dutch kept Run which they kind of already had again by that point. Um, but England kind of pulled a fast one by taking lime free nutmeg and planning it on different islands. Granada, who came out on top England, I would say, so, so they sorted in it up, trading Manhattan for nutmeg. That's a really really roundabout way to put it. Uh And then of course in sixteen seventy three the Dutch retook Manhattan said no, no, no, it's ours again. There was a third war, uh Anglo Dutch War, but they were also fighting the French at the same time, which really screwed them. They went bankrupt basically, and finally in sixteen seventy four, the Treaty of Westminster, they finally said, all right here, officially once again, you have Manhattan. Man that's where like all over the place, weren't they you you you're new that's it. That's all for nutmeg and Manhattan. I'd like to do more history of New York stuff. I love that. Yeah, it's cool, great topic, very cool. Uh well you got anything else? Yeah? If you want to learn more about nutmeg, you should type that word into the search part house stuff works dot com. You can can also type in East India, come Benny Dutch, West Indies company like all sorts of cool stuff, and it'll bring up all sorts of cool things TI Manhattan. You'll be pleasantly surprised if you type that into the search part. It's probably a drink maybe article in there that would pleasantly surprise me. Um so, I said, handy searcher bar, which means it's time for listening, made Josh appropriately enough. This is about Robert de Niro talking New York area. Hi, guys, I worked in the service industry for about ten years. This is about tipping the way from salad bars to four star hotels, and I've had tons and tons of stories. Most memorably is the one I had when I served Mr Robert de Niro named spando Um. This is about seven years ago. I was acting as doorman at the Fairmont Washington, d C. Nice Place. De Niro stayed with us for about three nights, and I happened to work every day during his stay. Because I worked the night shift, had several opportunities to greet him and his lovely life and pretty much no one else was around. His wife was very charming and talkative and would indulge the driver in genuine conversation. Uh. This would afford me time to fit in a little small talk with the man himself, and his reactions were classic DeNiro. He even shrugged his shoulders when he spoke the man is a movie. Can you imagine being DeNiro? Where people I was like, dude, that's so DeNiro. He's just like that's me, Like, please stop it. Anyways, for some reason, his wife and himself took a liking to me and requested me to assist him in checking out of the room at the end of the stay. He had three beautiful children, all mixed race like myself, and he had to tend to one of them who was dealing with an eye infection. A manager, luggage and their checkout and proceeded down to the driveway at the entrance. It was all hands on deck, including the general manager, all supervisors, and my bell staff. Problem is on a checkout like this, too many people getting the way of us, Lackey's receiving any kind of proper gratuity. On top of that, celebrity stind to have what we call a fixer, someone who acts as a little man between the hotel and the guests, because, of course the guests. I don't want to talk to the bellhop, got someone else do that. Uh So I'm waiting next to his vehicle, luggage is packed, not expecting any tip because it's part of the course with this kind of checkout, and I can't complain having had the opportunity to serve someone I admired greatly. At that point, Mr de Niro walked up to the fixer and I heard him say, are these guys taken care of of course? The fixer replies, oh, yes, of course, of course, of course, knowing darnwell that wasn't true. That's when de Niro pulls the most classic move ever. He looks at the fixer and says, okay, well, I want to take care of them myself. I wish I could do a de Niro. I'm not even gonna embarrass myself, though I'm surprised you can't. Uh proceeds to hand out twenty dollar bills to all of the bell men. Uh, simply for holding the door open. Then he walks over to me, thanks me for my service, and shakes my hand. My heart is beating like Jimmy Conway. I looked Jimmy Conway's boot in Billy Batt's face. I looked down and there are five bills folded up neatly in my palm. He see seriously folded up the bills in his bomb and shook my hand like Scorsese had just called action. Uh. The only thing I could think was, wow, he really just did that. I basically blacked out after that. And that it's from Corey Osborne and he came to and wrote the email. Pretty cool. I love that de Niro taking care of the common man. Yeah, and Boo on the fixer his Yeah. I thinks this, buddy, that was a great one. Thanks a lot, Corey. That was a good tipping story. That was maybe the best one we got, I think. So, um, let's see what else, Chuck, Yeah, nothing, I can't think of anything for anybody to write in about. Uh. If you got any interesting Manhattan history stories, that's a great one, or Brooklyn.
