Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and this is stuff you should know the podcast. And it's election day. We didn't mention that before. Oh yeah, you know, it's election day. I'm not sure when this is gonna come out. I can tell you exactly it's gonna come out. How do we know about this one? Well, it'll come out either the twenties, seventh or twenty nine of November. Yeah, great, what a great time to talk about pek oil. Yeah, the holiday season. Everybody's still digesting Thanksgiving dinner. Um, it's a little chilly out. It's what's every It's what everyone's thinking about right now when football and sports and stuff like that in fall colors. Let's talk about oil instead. When will the world's oil production be outstripped by demand irrevocably? That's right, that's what peak oil is. That's what we're talking about. Before we get started, I need to just clear something up. Peak oil is a definite thing. So where's the controversy when it's gonna happen, When it's gonna happen, and exactly what will happen after it? Help because reading this I was a little confused. It seemed like some people were like denying that it was going to happen at all or something. Yeah, we got run out of oil at some point. So if you talk to any peak oil adherent there's there's definitely some that are a little more the sky is following them, and I think they probably represent the minority, especially now. But if you went back to two when I wrote this, remember Matt Baker, Yes, Matt Baker, he used to work here. He was a developer. He got me into this, and he would go to like yeah, yeah, Matt, Yeah, he would go like meetings and like about the future without oil and like I mean like he was big time into it. And at that time, there are a lot of like very smart people talking very loudly saying like, dudes, we may have already hit peak oil and we need to start doing something about it or else, like we're really in really big trouble. Those those voices have quieted down quite a bit due to some developments in the last couple of years. It's almost kind of like a throwback. There's a lot of stuff happening. But um, for the most part, there is agreement that we will one day hit peak oil. And the definition of peak oil is now when we run out of oil, but when our oil production right like removing it from the ground, it can no longer keep up with demand. The whole reason that this will probably happen is because oil is a very finite resource, right, yes, and we are not treating it as such. No, So those two things combined mean that we're gonna gonna run out at some point. But even if we did treat it, like even if we did conserve our oil, but we didn't bring any other type of energy into it, it's it's a finite resource. Like it takes ten million years for um, these these fossil fuels at least to be produced to turn into crude oil. Um. The reason we have so much of it is because there was a massive die out of large dinosaurs. Now see I read that the dinosaurs had very little to do with it, and then it was like other, uh, living creatures. Well, you tell me who said that that's that's that's a good look it up. Some guy a lot smarter than me. Okay, So but regardless, regardless Um. The dinosaurs may or may not have had something to do with it. But things that lived at least ten million years ago and whose corpses were subject to these specific geological processes form oil. And there's only a very limited amount of it. It is the definition of a non renewable resource petroleum. We're going to run out of it event filling. But like you were asking, like when that happens, and what happens when we reach that point. That's what the debate over peak oil is. Because some people think we may never hit peak oil. Um, we may. We may come up with great alternative energy on the gaps as it were, right, um, and and like maybe we'll just leave oil behind, will never go back and like use up the whole world's apply because something else will come along or will master wind technology and we'll be fine. But for the most part, people agree that we will hit this point of peak oil, which again isn't running out of oil, it's where production plateaus and starts to decline, demand keeps increasing. Yes, I think you have a big problem there. If people don't get that by now, well no, if you the third time, if you talk to I can tell you that people who are peak oil adherents are very very satisfied with us right now because we pointed that out three times, because it's a big, big misconcept. Wait, is that him now he's coming in here to give us a bat on the back? I guess who could that be? King Hibbert Hubbert? He's dead? Probably, well, I believe, so all right, let's get it. Mean he was working in the fifties, So I guess we kind of we laid out while we're talking about but it is all based on M. King Hubbert's Hubbart curve. That's right. Do we need to talk about the VP reporter? Is that old news? Well they do that every year. Okay, so what does the recent one say? Do you know? Well, this is one of the recent developments. So this BPU Statistical Review of World Energy um BP compiles all of this energy information every year and it's a huge, awesome PDF of like energy information and um In two thousand eight they published that they that we have one point or one thousand, two d and thirty eight billion barrels of oil improved reserves. That's one point to trillion barrels of oil improved reserves. Now, proved reserve doesn't mean that like you already have it in a barrel. It means that some seismologists has done a geological survey of an area and said, yeah, there's oil there and it has a ninety percent chance of being easily extractable. Okay, and you probably have this many barrels in this reserve. That's a proven reserve, right, there's also probably stuff that we haven't found out there yet. That's that adds to the whole oil base. But BP set in two thousand eight that we have one point two trillion barrels of oil. In two twelve they said that we have one point six trillion. So we added four hundred billion barrels of oil in four years. That's a that's a that was a huge thing that quieted everybody down. Okay, well that's good. Yeah, UM could be a little hinky because, um, the people giving up this information um get you know, they get money and funding based on things like this. Yeah, if you remember, and they're not um, they're not checking their work as it were, either. So what you have is, um, you're not being audited, and if you lie about your numbers, you might get more funding. So a lot of people say, wait a minute, shouldn't trust reports like this there and yeah, there's for every for every bit of information or data, there's basically two ways to look at it. It's either truthful or here's all the reasons why it's probably not truthful. I know this is one of those things. Is just the point counterpoint just goes on and on and on. Yeah, And the reason why is because we have no idea how much oil is left on earth, Like, we can't say, and like the people who supposedly do know have reason to not be truthful about it, right or to exaggerate it. Even so, Um, the BP Statistical Review is very very widely respected. It's also criticized for that reason that you just said. But um, the the the whole idea behind this is what we were is based on what the guy who we were talking about, M. King Hubbard, came up with in the nineteen fifties, which is called the Hubbard curve. Right. Yeah, and this just makes sense to me. I don't know why it took this guy to come up with this, um, but it basically says, you know, what oil reserves are gonna follow, what trajectory, Um, you're gonna tap it and you're gonna pump oil out and after that production is gonna plateau and then it's gonna decline. Yeah, it took some smart guy to figure that out. Yeah, and I feel where you're coming, and I think the same thing, But I think like there's a specific like like this guy really grafted it out and could predict like within maybe a year or something like that, which he did. The reason why everybody listens to Hubbard was because, um, he predicted that the US would hit its own peak production in sometime between n and seventy. Well, he missed it by a year. The you s oil production peaked in nineteen and it's been declining ever since. Um. And this guy has made other great predictions. But the point is his Hubbard curve for any oil reserve, if you look at all of the reserves on Earth, is one large reserve, then the Earth's oil supplies to follow the same predictable curve. And eventually, when you hit this plateau and production starts to decline, it's inevitable. Right, That's right. It makes sense to you, it makes sense to me. So where's the problem? Uh, Well, the the In two thousand seven, the Government Accountability Office published another study that said, all right, we need to you know, guard ourselves against this potential fallout from the peak oil problem. And so there's a lot of factors here. You liken it to a marathon. This is a terrible analogy. I would say a relay race. That's where you messed up. Oh yeah, yeah, because any got different team members doing better or worse, oh, contributing or detracting. I walked right by that, man, I walked right by that. So let's look at a relay race. And each of the runners in your relay race is going to represent um oil consumption production or alternative fuels. So as alternative fuels get more advanced, then you're gonna be using less oil. So that's great um as uh consumption um, I guess you know we're trying to make moves to just consume less, right or conserve? Yeah, and conserving the uh Obamas put in place a lot of um stringent um rules for car manufacturers, the CAFE standards. So in August he did he signed in something and a lot of that doubles the CAFE standards to fifty four point five miles per gallon by that's awesome. Yeah, and that will huge impact on oil consumption. So if you're in your little relay race still, that means oil is stabilized a little more because you're just not using, using, using, you're decreasing supply, which is taxing demand, or you're decreasing demand, which is taxing supply lines. But then other bad things can happen. One of the little relay racers might get hung up by, um, the fact that China and India are growing in many ways and need some of that oil, and so all of a sudden you're going to be using more oil. And it's just a sort of a give and take, a little seesaw effect until I guess what, do you get a plateau? Or or that's just the changes the formulas. I think part of the analogy that I've I got wrong too was like I was making all these racers like racing towards the peak oil line, the finish line. Humanity is like on a way on its way toward that, but how fast we get there depends on these things. So it's almost like they're marbles or jacks or stuff for us to trip their banana peals. These are different kinds of banana appeals. Okay, some are slipper, more slippery than others. Very good then, UM. One thing is for sure is that here in the United States we use a lot of oil for UM transportation, that's the primary use of UM. What's the percentage now, seventy of all oil goes to transportation in the US? Does that worldwide? In the US? Sorry? UM? And as of now we are getting the good news is we're at a twenty year low for for for an oil imports were right, that's a very glib percentage, Like when it gets the energy. You really have to pay attention to what how a statistic is worded, because there's a lot of different factors involved. There's a lot of different ways of looking at And that's a really good example of seventy of all of our petroleum goes to transportation. That's mind boggling figure. But what we're really talking about is not oil consumption or energy consumption. We're talking about where that oil goes to and actually are assumption of oil in the US has declined in the last few years. So while we're still using seventy of all that oil for transportation, we're actually using less oil overall. What about the imports though, is that what you were talking about, Well, the imports have actually declined as well. No, no, that's what I said. But you said that's the stat that you have to be really wary of. Well, you have to be wary of all the two stats. But no, like there are some that are just kind of broad and above boards, and one of them is how much we're using how much we're importing UM and are actually we're we're importing more but we're using less. So we're importing something like UM sixty of all the all the petroleum we used in two thousand eleven we imported, yeah, which is more than the fifty eight percent in two thousand seven. So it took a sharp decrease in because we're at now as of August of two thousand twelve. No way, Yeah, it's a twenty year low for foreign oil imports. Okay, all right, so we currently we're using UH as far as this two thousand and eleven, we used an average of eighteen thousand, eight hundred and thirty five thousand barrels per day, which is a very British way of saying eighteen point eight three five million barrels a day. Yes, a day. It's a lot yeah, a lot of petrol, which is also very British, right, Um, but we we were importing less and that's actually less than we were using before. And you say there's a sharp decline down to what down to where at a twenty year low supposedly of foreign imports of imports not necessarily consumption imports. Okay, and why uh, well, a lot of reasons. I know that they found a lot more oil in America recently, apparently Texas and I think one of the Dakotas. And from what I understand, also natural gas is stepping up in in providing a lot more energy than it was before. Good for you natural gas. Yeah, aside from the whole fracking problem. Frack that so chuck, where are we at all? Right? I think we're the problems the other side of the coin. Two thousand six, the Cambridge Energy Research Associates said, you know what, We've got lots of oil. Don't you worry about it. We've actually got three point seven four trillion barrels, three times as many as uh, you guys said as the peak oil proponent coil proponent. Yeah, that's that's you guys. And um, and don't you worry about it. It's gonna be an undulating plateau. It's gonna be this drop off, and we got oil for decades and decades that we can fill in the gaps as things come along with other forms of energy, and the sky is not falling. Just shut up and watch Dancing with the Stars, right, And if you read that BP reported, it says that we have enough improven reserves to last us uninterrupted for fifty four point five years. Fifty four point two years UM, which is a very long time. That's a lot of oil. Peak oil people say that it's great, man, that's awesome, But we can't just sit back and say, well, we're just gonna keep going like this for fifty four years, because we will shoot ourselves in the foot. The whole point of believing in peak oil is saying that you we have to take steps now to make sure that when we hit that fifty four point two year we're fine. We're totally covered. But as you say, there are plenty of people out there, like the c r A or SIRA that says, you guys are crazy. Just settle down, yeah, Like, and you know the reason they say things like this is because there's a lot of oil out there that we haven't even touched. In the Arctic, for example, Um, maybe a hundred and eighteen billion barrels of oil. And we know it's out there. This is not a theory. No, they're discovered in the fifties. Yeah, it's we know it's out there. It's just really expensive to go get because it's in the Arctic. Yeah, this costs a lot of lobbying money to get into the Arctic to under the ocean. Lots of oil down there. It's just very deep. We're just we're just waiting, and we got this oil shell all over Canada. Canada is basically like one big oil shell in the Western US too. Don't worry people, We've got all these these super fields that we haven't even discovered yet. There's tons of oil. Don't worry about it, so chuck. The reason why we have all this oil but it's just sitting there, um, is mainly because it's expensive to get it. Under these conditions, you still have plenty of oil that's easily gotten right, um. And usually the way we get oil is in a three stage process, and most companies are only up to stage two, so it's really a two stage process. Does anyone even go to the third stage. Not yet in the future. Sorry. Uh that that's like that when when oil prices rise so high that your paycheck goes to buy gas, that's when they can afford. Yeah, because when you're paying twenty dollars a gallon for gas, then they can afford to go down to the art exactly. It's an economic incentus. So normally when you get oil um stage one is where you like tap the reservoir and oil pretty much just bubbles up out of the ground. You get about ten percent of that reservoir from that first stage. Second one you have to exert a little bit of effort. You pump some CO two or some water into there, and you recharge it and it starts to come up. You get anywhere from like another twenty Yeah, I think a lot of the if you watch, like there will be blood. I think those early guys, those were the dudes. I mean, they're the dudes that are now you know, the one percent, Like I don't even think they were probably going secondary. They were just going around from oil, you know, tapping that top ten percent cheaply and just moving on. But but now they move on after the second stage. Yes, after the second stage gesture you've taken um anywhere from what thirty two, which means there's fifty of that reservoir still left. You cap it and say, well, let's mark the spot and move on. P on it right, put you a little flag down. Well, now you want to use like some sort of um phosphorescent or fluorescent like crayon the market and you can come back with the black light and be like, oh here it is X marks the spot. So they cap it again because of expense, because to go down and get that final is just too expensive right now. Same with extracting oil from oil shale or tarsans or um getting into the Arctic or into the deep ocean. There's just not an economic incentive. But if you are a m a critic of peak oil, you're going to say we'll get to that when, like we have all that extra stuff out there. Calm down, Yeah, right. It is kind of good to know in a way, you know, it's it's it's it's not. I mean, I guess it's probably good that it's exp and because it would be very human like to just suck those things as dry as a bone and then move on and they're my friend, you just tapped into the central theme of peak oil. It is very humanlike to just keep plotting along and and suck something down to the bone and not look beyond that day when the bone is dry. Yeah, yeah, you're right. It's sad. I've always wondered too if the Earth needed oil, and I've looked it up on the internet and I can't find anything. Remember I talked about this before. I don't remember what that was. And I researched again a little bit last night. I was like, and I can't find any intelligent person on the internet that it's not just some message board saying, you know, oil is the blood of the Earth and the planet and if we suck it dry, like why do you think we have earthquakes? So, but I don't know. There's oil and earth. It's conservaive function, right, I would imagine, maybe I would think. So I tend to think of things is um as a whole like that, like the Earth has Maybe there's reasons for everything like that, or even if there isn't a reason, that's been around so long, even something's become dependent on it. So it's important to something else other than our cars, right, And it is a lubricator and it is found within hard rock. I don't know, maybe I'm crazy. So Chuck, we talked about UM, how this article is kind of almost a throwback. It's a it's like a snapshot of like this kind of I don't want to say hysteria because I think it's it's right. But there was a lot of stuff going on in like two thousand and eight that we're making these peak oil adherents UH say hey, we're right. Everybody pay attention. And probably the thing that UM verified their beliefs more than anything else came on July eleven, two eight, when oil reached an all time high of a hundred and forty seven dollars of barrel. That is expensive, right, And if you believe in peak oil, or if you are an adherent of the peak oil idea, UM, this is like one of the four horsemen riding out of the sky. But the thing was they ended up being UM. They were duped like everybody else by the speculators who had driven up prices, but they were saying, no, this is a problem. This is part of what they call peak light, which they think we've hit. Peak light is basically where production starts the plateau and we don't realize that it's going to eventually decline. But we're in the plateau, and um, there will be like little highs and lows, and all of those are going to each one reflects this smaller scale, longer time frame version of the actual peak oil. But it's kind of, um, it's like the smaller, smaller version of it. Once we hit the peak, and they think that's where we are now. Um, And if you ask me, that peak sounds an awful lot like what Sara was saying. The undulating plateau and peak light sound like they're virtually the same. Maybe so, yeah, but they disagree on when we hit that. Well, oil per barrel is lower now. Um, thankfully, that's one big thing. As far as this month goes, eight six dollars and thirty seven cents, we've added since two thousand and eight, we've added almost half a trillion barrels of oil improve reserves. It's a big one. So we're moving in the right direction in some ways. Yeah, correct. Alternative fuels. Alternative fuels are making up a lot bigger chunk they make up for the first time. And here's a good example of another statistic. You have to pay attention to alternative fuels UM or renewables and nuke and hydro. For the first time ever in world energy consumption make up more of the energy being used than any single fossil fuel for the first time ever in two thousand and eleven has happened. It's great covering growth and can omption. So there's your there's a very big key factor that means that everything passed the year before. That's the growth in consumption, right, So it's covering of that, not of all energy consumption. So it sounds like this huge enormous number and it's a good hardening number, but it's not what you think. Like, you really have to pay attention when you're talking about energy consumption or energy stats they're true, because stats can be very misleading in this realm, right, and so um one of the big problems with peak oil is anytime you say, well, hey, we have stuff in the Arctic reserve, so we're fine, there's a lot of other problems that come up in conjunction with it. Oil is it's very dirty, uh literally and metaphorically that's right. You could destroying ecosystem very easily, very easy in the Arctic, very precious balanced ecosystem. Okay, so let's just think all of our money into all alternative energy. It sounds like you're saying, yeah, I would say that's a great move, but um, it can be uh promising on one hand, but things like switch grass and say yello stick ethanol are very corrosive and it's very expensive to retrofit gas pumps at a gas station and gas storage tanks. It's like a grand gas station. Yeah, so it's not like there's some super easy answer. Well plus also plus also it's like, um, you're taking investment money away from finding new oil fields coming into alternative energy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing until you realize that. Well, wait a minute, we are. We're globalized, so if you take away oil from China and India, you're gonna slow down this economic engine. Strike that balance, right. It's Homer with the goldfish and Mr Pinchie again with the salt. You know, it's the same thing. Coal. Um, they can actually make liquid coal now that can power a vehicle, which is great with no alterations. You can pump it right into your car. The bad thing is, um, coal is really dirty and you're going to be emitting four to eight percent more greenhouse gases than gasoline. Even so again no easy answer. Well, the same goes for natural gas. Natural gas made up of UM. The energy provided in the US that was consumed was provided by natural gas last year. That's huge. It's more than coal came out of nowhere. Right. But the problem is is that you have fracking alongside of that, Like to exhibit, you have to basically like create an environmental disaster every time. UM. So there, Yeah, there's all these problems with mitigating it, but the worst thing you can do is nothing. This one report that's kind of like peak oil adherence Bible found it's called the Hirsh Report, Yeah, or a k a. Peaking of World oil production, colon impacts, mitigation and risk management and UM. Robert why they call it the Hersh Report. Robert Hirsch put this together and basically laid out three scenarios. It's UM, do nothing, start ten years ahead of time to help out this problem, or start twenty years ahead of time to to really head off this problem and to head off these mitigations. It's UM figuring out alternative fuels, decreasing demand UM basically like just doing whatever you can to take the pressure off of production. Yeah, so that we still have oil, we're just using less of it. Yeah, And unsurprisingly, he says twenty years before it would be the best way to handle this, ten years before. If you did that, he said, it could be a pretty smooth transition. Um, if you start ten years before, then what were You're gonna have a problem for about a decade, a shortfall And if you don't do anything, then you're gonna have at least a twenty years shortfall. And so what we're talking about, and there's like, yes, a global energy um shortfall. Scared, that's scary times there, because oil, petroleum, crude, oil and petroleum are found in our medicine, our foods. They are used by the tanker trucks and ships that deliver petroleum use petroleum to deliver it. It's everything to everybody. It's the lifeblood of of the global economic engine. And dude, like, we've never experienced anything like what like the catastrophic collapse that would happen if we experience a ten year global energy shortfall. I got two words for you, mad Max. Yeah, I think, yeah, I don't I think like I don't see an end of that, Like if we experienced ten years or twenty years, I don't see how we would ever come out of that. Yeah, I mean, because it's easy to say, well, get on your bicycle, but like you said, it's not just hey, I put gas in my car to go to work. It is everything, Like all of a sudden, I can't get food delivered to the grocery store with medicines. Uh. Yeah, it's pretty scary thought. And the big part of the I guess probably the biggest problem is like we won't know when we hit peak oil until a few years afterwards, when all these telltale signs start coming. And I'm sure most people won't agree, so it'll probably be several years afterwards. But when it's just painfully obvious that, oh, production is being outstripped by demand. Supplies can't keep up with demand anymore, and it looks like it's never going to go back up, which means we've hit peak oil, which means we're in trouble. What mitigation measures do we have in place? Yeah. One thing you don't want to hear someone say is oops, you know, especially when you're talking about the global economic engine. Yeah, and I think you said some people claim that it might have already happened in two thousand five. Others say, um, no, you know what we're good to. What is when we hit that undulating plateau, which which which should be not a problem as far as serious concerned. But even um is what you said the most conservative peak oil. Um, that's about say enthusiasts, but inherences. Um, And yeah, that's the latest they think it's going to happen as far as as when I wrote this in two thousand and eight. Now, a bunch of stuff have happened. Remember, we added almost half a trillion barrels of oil, we're using less, our cafe standards were increased recently. Um, the three point four percent of all new car registrations in the US and two thousand eleven, No, two doesn't twelve so far, Um, we're hybrid or electric, which is one percent just a few years ago. But it's such a drop, it is, But like all of those drops count in like just kind of prolonging this this point until we get to peak oil. Alternative energy UM investments are up. It's like we're doing all this great stuff and as a result, all of the people, all these really loud voices that had like a real stage in two thousand eight and had the ears of a lot of people who were um governing at the time. Um these the climate has changed, and I wonder if like it was because of a lot of these peak oil adherents shouting really loud that we have made some concessions. But now I wonder if we're just going to become complacent, right, like, oh well we staved it off, we're fine for now, and we're just gonna kick it on down the road, because I don't see a lot of effort going into it. I mean not there's some, but certainly not what is needed. I just feel like we're all headed towards the cataclysmic like collapse of humanity. Eventually we're all going to turn on each other and and ruin ourselves, and the Earth will be scorched and empty. May not be anytime soon, we're maybe hundreds and hundreds of years from now. Who knows, but anyone that thinks that humans on planet Earth or we're gonna be around infinitely forever because we're humans, it's just, you know, they're pooling themselves as fool's gold. Nice. How's that for happy? That was perfect. If you wanted to learn more about peak oil, you can type those words into the search bar at how stuff works dot com and will bring up this article. And I said search bar s means it's time for listener mail, Chuck, I'm gonna call this where's the orchestra um? This is from Eric Stephens and he is a double bass player principal double bass player in an orchestra near Cologne, Germany. And he listened to the Ben s Alicia about music and emotion, which we got great feedback on. And he says many thanks to Ben, who played another fantastic and inspiring performance. He's a beautiful open way of discussing music. I couldn't agree more. Many thanks to him for mentioning the importance of classical music. It's an art form that, unfortunately two feetle too few people are exposed to now, having a lot to do with its financial and logistical complexities, but nonetheless one of the most powerful and underrated forms of music today, and it has contributed so much to how we in the Western world here proceed of music today. I would really love it if you guys could get out and hear another performance sometime. Even more so if you encourage s Y s K listeners to get out and experience and support their local orchestras. Um. It is difficult time for orchestras right now, and has been mentioned many are being forced to downsize or fold altogether. This is one of the reasons why I've ended up in Germany, which still heavily supports many orchestras with state financing and media. The appreciation is very deeply rooted in the culture out here, and while it's a slightly different situation in the States. I want to remind people that classical music is not exclusive unless you make it so. And I would go on to even point out that he means orchestral music. Classical is a period of time. Oh yeah, you know, way to correct him. He probably doesn't appreciate that. Um, it is not exclusive unless you make it so. So you don't need to have a tuxedo or a deep musical education to appreciate the extreme beauty and the importance of it. Couldn't agree more. Please give it a chance, He'll keep it alive. And uh, that is very good advice. Support your local orchestra. I guarantee you whatever town you live in, unless you're in some really backward Kansas Field town, you probably got an orchestra. Even if it's a smallest town, you might am an orchestra. Yeah, if you're in a big city, you definitely have an orchestra. Yes, go out and see. It's usually pretty cheap. Um, it's not like paying for you know, sixty bucks to go see Jack White make noise. I like Jack lydextra, but he's charging too much. Sixty bucks ahead. Yeah, when he played that, he got that rack. Rock and tours fan together tickets for like sixty or seventy by bucks. It's a lot for one album of material for a lot anyway.

Well, I don't think you can count on an orchestras playing on that day in every town and arts. Well, let's find out about it. Let's find out all right, let's even get that together, like like, no, I don't think we can make that happen. But maybe there's a day when the orchestras typically play like traditionally speaking, Or how about like this winter season, make a commitment to go out because you're gonna be darn sure that building orchestra playing some sort of Christmas classical concertos. All right, that's it. You you have to go out and see an orchestra this winter. Yeah, but don't. No, Cracker is not bad depending on where you see it. I like it's a little doll really thinks huh oh for me? Sure, there's like giant soldier and a huge there's a rat that hits people with this. There's a lot of stuff going on. Um, well, what do you like to go see? You see Christmas Carol? No, I mean I don't do any of that stuff. I see I see Jack White and complain. Um, let's see if you have a favorite band you'd like to see that you think Chuck and I should see, or a performance of some sort uh, whether it's Nutcracker or Jack White or whatever.
