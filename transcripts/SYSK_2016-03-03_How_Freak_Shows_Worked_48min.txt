This shout out up you, Chuck, Priyan, Jerry, and this is stuff you should know. You introd as if you were asleep and I just walked by and poked you with a bold cube and that's your first thing you do is you wake up and just go, hey, welcome to the podcast. How are you, sir man. I'm feeling fine, Yeah, good, feeling fine. That's a Simpsons reference from what the Shining One? Oh yeah, the Shooting Classic. It's a good one. Um. So a couple of quick matters of business, a little c o A. At the beginning, we're talking about freak shows, and we will be saying freaks and things like that. That is obviously an antiquated term, um, but a lot of there are a lot of quotes in here and a lot of references to uh, freaks and midgets and pin heads and all these awful terms that they used to call these people that had, you know, physical deformities and maladies. Um, so it's not us speaking. This is a historic in historical context, Like we get the insensitivity. Yeah, it's not. We're not We're not being insensitive. Here's uh and we want to shout out if you. We used a couple of house Stoff how stuff it works, How stuff Works articles, as well as one from History Magazine by Laura Grande Priceonomics Zachary Crockett wrote one and who I have to say, I'm a fan of that dude's work. Yeah, it was a good artic prisonomics these and some really interesting articles, agreed. And then one from human Marvels dot com, which is just a good website by j tithonus now announced right p E D in a U D. Yeah that's a tough one. Now, yeah, I assume the D is silent or maybe not. Maybe it's ped now pay node node huh freaky and a couple of other places we visited. So and everyone kind of says the same thing. But it's a nice, well rounded thing. I think, Yeah, well they I mean, we're talking about the history of freak shows and there's only you know, one history. Yeah, certain things happen, and we found we found very quickly that like you can't extract um freak shows from P. T. Barnum or vice versa. No, like they they they are inextricably bound. But freak shows, um, you know Barnum was working in the nineteenth century. But the concept of freak shows, which um is basically someone who is a human curiosity, and that could be someone who was born with a genetic deformity, of physical deformity um, some sort of mental incapacity um, or some people have turned themselves into human curiosity, say through the wonder of tattooing or um learning to swallow swords or something like yeah, or like these days body modification like the gym Rose show or there's one in Coney Island still that does a like a traditional show. Yeah, side show by the Seashore also a great song by Luna Nice, one of my favorite bands. Um. So, the the whole concept of this of having a human curiosity and um basically charging gawkers to look at it, it dates back quite a way, is um. Well, actually not that far the sixteenth century. That's pretty far, I guess so. But you would think like, well, the Greeks or the Romans did this, but apparently no everybody was fairly Um, from what I understand, everybody just kind of steered clear of human curiosities to that point. Yeah, I think people feared them, right. They were locked away mainly because they thought it was some evil curse or punishment from God. And this wasn't someone you wanted to consort with. Else you might bring back, bring down the wrath of God upon yourself. That's right. But like you said, in the late fifteen, hundreds of people started to say, you know what I'm curious about, um, someone with hair growing all over their face. I'm curious about the human curiosity exactly. And I know I don't Chuck, I want to say, I don't think it's coincidence that about this time, science was starting to spread throughout Europe. So the idea that um, this was God's breath was was taking a bit of a back seat to uh, this is a human condition of some sort, yes, but not so far down the road of science, to where there was this intermediate period where they were got Dad, And as we'll find out later, science would eventually take part in ending the sideshows right created them and it ended them. Yeah, it's kind of neat good way to look at it. Uh so one of the first UM viewings or one of the first people put on display and you know this is also going to be well, we'll get into it later, but the morality of this is very up and down with exploiting people and these people that would normally be locked away actually having super lucrative careers long lasting made them rich well. Plus also, UM, I think one of the authors, I think it was Crockett points out that, UM, there early on, if you were in a freak show, there was a good chance that um, you had been abandoned by your parents, became a ward of the state and adopted by somebody who just ruthlessly exploited you and maybe barely took care of you. But one thing you can definitely say to his credit, as Barnum came into it and basically normalized or created an industry out of freak shows or four freak shows, UM, conditions definitely changed and the exploitation seems to have less in some way. Yeah. I think that with the big names like Norman and Barnum, I think they were all manner of minor side shows that probably didn't treat them as well. Uh, And usually Barnum and Norman bought their curiosities from those minor side shows, lesser show exactly. So we're tking about Tom Norman out of England. Yeah, they were basically counterparts. Yeah, and what we'll get into them back to one of the earliest um quote unquote freaks was a man named Lazarus Colorado not Colorado, who was a conjoined twin. He had a brother, Johannes, who was upside down on his chest and technically it was a parasitic twin to Lazarus. Oh, not conjoined twins. They were conjoined. But Johannes like didn't eat, okay, he um he could, He didn't speak, he never opened his eyes, and apparently the only way you could get a physical reaction out of him was if you rubbed his chest. That would make him squirm like quaide and total recall very much got you. So. Uh. He went on tour, performed before King Charles the First in the early sixteen forties. But it was not a big deal. It wasn't a super lucrative. Side shows weren't really a thing at that point. No, but this guy was saying, Uh, you guys are gonna ostracize me. Well, I'm going to charge you to look at me then, and I'm going to support myself and my brother doing this. Yeah, he did it himself. It's not clear whether he worked with a manager or not or a promoter, but he definitely um made his own choice to go do this, Yes, exactly. And he was apparently an otherwise handsome man. That's how everyone described him, which I think probably for the court Um or Europe who who came and looked at him, uh, probably just made it even more mind boggling, you know. But he's a good guy right right, you know. Uh, P T. Barnum and I think we should do in a whole podcast on PT Barnam at some point to really close out the circus suite. Well, then we shouldn't mention him again in the show. No Barnum as as a teenager, Uh, he always had a penchant for making money. He was one of those magnets sort of weird ways. Uh. He ran his own lottery as a teenager um in Connecticut and he said, here's what I'll do. I can just sell these tickets. I'll give out prizes in varying levels from dollars on down to like CS and U yeah and um. But it was very well thought out for a teenager. He wasn't just like just one prize. He spread it out so he would entice people to play more. Uh. And he actually made a lot of money from it until they outlawed the lottery. He was making like eleven grand in today's dollars a week as a teenager. Yeah, nineteen not bad. But then Connecticut and the rest of the country said no more lotteries for now. Um, we'll bring that back up later though, don't you worry, TB C and Um. He had to find other ways to make work, moved to New York City and in eighteen thirty five, UM, he had You know, England is where a lot of this started. We'll talk about Norman in a second, but he got his queue from England, said here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna buy a person. I'm gonna buy my first freak uh, this blind paralyzed slave woman. And this is a hallmark of freak shows, as I'm gonna make up a story about her that's sensational and crazy, like a Ripley's believe it or not kind of thing, right, and Embarnum in particular was well known for just taking these things to the nth degree, like, sure, no one's gonna buy that, but he could sell it in such a way that people believed it because they were exponentially dumber back then. Uh. He the story for her was that she was a hundred and sixty years old, was George Washington's nurse. Uh and you can pay to see her, when in fact she was only eighty years old. She was half that age. Yeah, and her name was Joyce Heath, and she was just an old lady right. Yeah, she was an old slave woman who was paralyzed and blind and was being exploited by p. T. Barnum in the year before her death. So she dies um, but before then, like as he's touting her as this hundred and six year old former nurse made to George Washington. Um, that gets an initial reaction and then ticket sales drop, and then PiZZ Barnum did something quite smart. He wrote an anonymous letter to a Boston newspaper and accused himself of being a fraud and saying that the the hundred and sixty year old woman was a fake that she was actually a machine, a robot made of whale skin and it and ticket sales went right through the roof again. Man, what a guy. There should be a good movie about him. I can't believe there's not, like a modern one. I'm sure there is, you know, surely, like the what's the one? The Greatest Show on Earth was a movie? Right, and Griffith movie or something. Yeah, that's what I mean. But like Tom Cruise should play him, yeah, and should be directed by Michael Bay Russell Crowe should No, not Russell Crowe. Well, how about who could play p. T. Barnum? You know who who? He would be good at it, but it'd just be so him. Sam Rockwell, oh totally, he could play anything. So I'd rather see somebody even broader playing him. Yeah, I heard research look ahead, Gina. Who would end up playing him is freaking Hugh Jackman. And yeah, yeah, because he can do cartwheels. Yeah, what were you gonna say? Somebody? It might have been during the Bill Gates interview, were something yesterday that somebody said that no, it was unseen it. Tom Hanks is the most trusted person in America. Like for some poll found that like the most trusted person in America is Tom Hanks. Were we on the list? I don't think so. Sure you got it dressed on. We're not even Also rans were never rans? Alright. So he purchased that woman what was her name, joyce heth j O I C E H E T H for a thousand dollars and he made about that every week, um from exploiting her. I imagined that she got very little of that. Yeah, although you can't necessarily say that I didn't see what she was paid, she was very likely paid. And I'm she was probably fairly well taken care of, especially considering um that she probably just And this is based on how Barnum treated other people later in a documented manner. But um he I don't want to say he rescued her from slavery because she went from being a slave to being owned by somebody who exhibited her. Um. But it's not a guarantee or a given that her situation got worse after she she was purchased by Barnum. Right, does that make sense? Man? That felt like a minefield? I was talking about slavery, human exploitation. A blind woman who was also paralyzed. Good, good, luck sir um his first big hoax after that or uh, well, actually I guess it wasn't a hoax aside from the made up story. But um, he had a real hoax. That was a hoax. Well I hope sure, um, but this was a hoax in two because it was nothing about it was real. He was promoting something called the Fiji Mermaid, which was basically rogue taxidermy as all it was. That's exactly what it was. It was a creature with a head of a monkey and the tail of a fish that he bought from Japanese sailors. Well he didn't. He got it from a sailor who bought it from right, and actually it was Japanese fisherman. Yeah, and he well, what's the difference. Well, they're like traditional they didn't necessarily go to see they were like islanders and this is like traditional art for them, folk art. So not a sailor but fisherman. Right, that's that entry one oh one. Sorry it's so fixated on things. Yeah. Uh. And he leased it um for twelve fifty a week twelve dollars and fifty cents um from from the owners have said rogue taxidermy and he tried, he purnt up pamphlets and tried to convince everyone it was some real thing. So he he actually had a um A partner named Levi what was Levi's name? He's definitely an overlooked guy, Levi Lyman. Can you imagine like being P. T. Barnum's partner, Like you'd never be in the spotlight a right, So Levi Lyman posed as a English doctor, a scientist who was in possession of this mermaid, and UM P. T. Barnum very publicly was trying to get his hands on the mermaid, and this guy was very publicly resisting him because there was a man of science and this was the real deal. And it helps just convince everybody, including the newspapers, that like this is the genuine article, just Rubes Nation, a world of Rubes. It seems like he ended up opening up a museum on Broadway in New York City, UM, eighteen forties, you know, sort of you know, like a Ripley's Believe it or not kind of thing. Curiosities and weird things. Yeah, that's those his stock in trade. Uh. And then we should talk about his counterpart in England, UM Tom Norman. Yeah, Tommy Norman, Tommy Norman. Uh. He was named the Silver King and Barnum actually gave him that name apparently after meeting him, and he said, boy, what a huge silver showy silver watch you have there. You're the Silver King. He goes, I am the Sill King. I've been waiting my whole life for somebody to notice exactly. So he was doing the same thing in England. Uh. And he he actually um, he toured with Joseph Merrick the Elephant Man. Yeah, and he got um castigated by a lot of people saying, you're exploiting this guy John Merrick and h is it John or Joseph? What I say John? Yeah? And it's like an ongoing thing. Oh is it yeah, I can't remember if it's well, let's find out. No, it's Joseph for sure. Had just misspoke. Um. He was attacked in specifically in a memoir by Dr Frederick Treeves uh called The Elephant Man and other Reminiscences. Uh. And he shot back and he said, you know what, I haven't mistreated Merrick, haven't abused him. Uh. He wasn't forced to do anything. And he said, in fact, the big majority of showmen are in the habit of treating their novelties as human beings and in a large number of cases as one of their own, not like beasts. Right. So uh, you know, the morality battle was being waged even back then. Yeah. And I mean if you you think about um, this time when people would go look at people who had physical deformities and pay for it and just look at him just standing there, you think, well, the whole world was pretty evil and a moral at the time not necessarily true. There's a, um, a lot of people who railed against this stuff, like Frederick Treeve's who was um. He was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, right, isn't that him? Yeah? He was in The Elephant Man the movie? Was he actually Marrick's doctor? Dn't yeh man? That movie? Yeah? David Lynch god one of the best ever. Um. And then there was an historian who at the time, I think in like the eighteen sixties he wrote. His name was Henry Mayhew and in eighteen sixty when he was British, he wrote that that these freak shows were nothing more than human degradation. And he said something that stuck out to meet Chuck. He said that the men who preside over these infamous places, know too well the failings of their audience. And I think he really hit the nail on the head by he wasn't accusing the showman because I think he understood that most of these people were just under contract, and he wasn't accusing the people, the actual human curiosities, the freaks themselves. He was rightly placing the blame for all this on the observers, the gawkers. Like if there wasn't a market for it, they wouldn't be doing it. Yeah, Like you're the one who is having the moral failing. Who's paying to go see this person who may or may not be exploited you don't know, And uh, it's really on you audience. Yeah, it's pretty Uh it's a lot of foresight for back then, I thought so too. So it's not like the point was. It's not like everybody was just going along with this. People have had a problem with it basically the whole time freak shows were around. All right, well, let's take a break and we'll talk a little bit more about um, the evolution of the side show. Right after this, we're back. I brought my pencil. What's up? Oh right, on man. I didn't get that at first, do you. I'm impressed that you did get it nice. Uh. That was from Van Halen's popular song Hot for Teacher from and we are now nineteen eighties DJs. Uh. So the side shows became a legitimate thing, a big way to make money. There were different kinds. Um. There was one called a tin in one show, which I believed the sides side show by the sea shore is today you did it through my missing tooth. Uh. And that is when you have ten people on display on a platform at once and people just walk by and look at them. It's not like a performance. It's just there's a bearded lady, there's the dog faced boy, there's the tattooed man, and they're all of the standing there. That's a tin and one. Uh. They had things, and this was all too to drum up more money. They would advertise something as an adults only or a man only even performance. Right. Well, the men only performance frequently had a stripper you know, yeah, um, or stuff that they thought that we're just like a woman shouldn't see or children shouldn't see. I don't know if it was as much of that as if it was to just trump up like, oh my god, it's so bad that a woman can't see lay her eyes upon it. Um, I think it's all part of the show. Uh, that's my feeling. At least. One of the things that they displayed were something called a pickled punk, which is awful, especially when you find out what it is. Yeah, it's basically a an abnormal fetus in a formalbe hyde in a jar. And you could go by and look at pickled punks and gawk at them for money. It's it's awful. Yeah, this is what people did, like on Saturday night in Kansas. So um, the the usually this this side shows of the freak shows. At first, they were you would be some enterprising entrepreneur in some small town and you would notice that a little youngster had um a third leg, okay, and you your thought was, I can really make some money with this kid. So you go to their parents and you'd say, I will give you of all of the earnings of your child if you let me take him on the road, and he will stay in the finest hotels and we're the best clothes as exactly, and uh, the he will become famous in the world, will love him, h, just let me handle it. I'm going to be as manager from now on. And the parents would very frequently, especially if they were poor, would say, that's great. Do that give me some money upfront though, by the way, yeah, especially because a lot of times some of these people were a burden on their family because of their health condition, so they were happy to be rid of them. That's all very sad, okay. So that's how that's how it definitely started out. And then and it went on like that um for a very long time as well. But once borne him and not a Norman and some of the other guys, the big guys came around, they would just basically keep an eye out for that kind of thing, or they would be approached by these guys who would essentially be middleman kind of like um, somebody who discovered a boy band selling their contract to a bigger record company. But this was with human curiosity, people with the third lagger, hyper trichosis or what have you. UM. And then Barnum would take him and would would just take whatever exaggerated origin story that they came with and just throw it out and come up with one ten times more uh. And after his uh George Washington's nurse made Joyce heth died, who was not George Washington's right. He started looking around for his next collaborator, if you could call him that, um, and he found out that he had a distant cousin, a fifth cousin UM named Charles Stratton, who had stopped growing when he was about two years old. Yeah. He he never completely stopped. He grew very slowly. He made it to like just over three feet I think by the time his death. Yeah. He died at forty five of a stroke and he was three point three five ft tall. Um, but grew so slowly. I mean you know he was He was General Tom Thumb, very famously renamed General Tom Thumb by his half fifth twice removed cousin. Uh pt what does that stand for? Even Paul Thomas Anderson bon uh So he said, you know what this is great. Um, you were a small person and you're cute as the dickens, So let me dress you up in little adult suits and you're my new sidekick. Yeah that he He collaborated with the kid's dad and said, let's, um, let's make some money. Uh and he um he taught him how to sing and dance, pretend he was Napoleon, He did impressions Cupid, he played Cupid sometimes, and then he told everybody that this little five year old kid was actually eleven, which made it all the more astounding that he was that small, which he didn't even need to do, you know. And then for about the next like fifteen or so years, Um turned Tom Thumb into what was essentially the first international celebrity. Oh was he the first international celebrity? Pretty much? Tom Thumb was a sensation. Queen Victoria was a huge fan, met met with him twice to at least twice um. She apparently was really big into side shows, but Tom Thumb was her favorite. Um and he. They made so much money off of their first European tour that um Barnum bought his museum with the proceeds. Is there anything grosser than the Queen of England laughing at a small person imitating Napoleon for money. She may have even known Napoleon at the time, Oh, I'm sure she. That probably made it all the funnier to her. Unbelievable. So, but he was. He was a rich dude. He was paid uh in today's dollars Tom Thumb. Oh yeah, over four thousand dollars a week and retired and lived the high life in New York City. Um. And you know he didn't feel like he was exploited. No, he he actually got married. I saw that he had children, but I could I only saw that one place. I didn't see it anywhere else. But he he was married and actually, um, right after the marriage was brought to the White House to hang out with Abraham Lincoln and Mrs Lincoln. Yeah, he had twenty people at his funeral. He he was again, he was a very big deal. And from what I understand, at the end of the day, he shed his persona. He was just Charles Stratton, uber wealthy, uh, some little person um. And when he was doing his show, he was Tom Thumb who would dress up as Napoleon or whatever and take your money. But um, he he and P. T. Barnum together really made a ton of cash. Tom Thumb was a little better at managing his cash than Barnum was, because Barnum fell in hard times. A lot of people don't realize this, but he made some actually really bad investments over over time too. Yeah, he invested a lot of his money initially back into his business, which was smart, right, and but a lot of times he would be like this is gonna be a hit and it wouldn't be a hit. He didn't have the Midas touch necessarily, and he fell on hard times more than once. One of the times Um Tom Thumb or Charles Stratton bailed him out. Oh really, I get the feeling Barnum didn't know when to leave well enough alone, you know, like he had a big, thriving business and he just kept wanting to push it further and further. Hugh Jackman, I'm telling you. Uh So, now we will talk about a couple of people, um, who are afflicted with something. Uh. Well, they were micro cephalic, which means that they have a cone shaped head smaller than normal shaped head as well. Yes, if you've ever if you're a Howard Stern fan, then you know beetlejuice, he has his condition. Um. And they used to call them pinheads back in the day, awful term. Uh. And there were a couple of notable I'm not even gonna keep saying that, but a couple of notable people that performed um in these freak shows. One was Zip William Henry Johnson renamed Zip to z I P. He's from New Jersey, born to newly freed slaves and uh. When Barnum found him, he says, you know, I'm gonna do gonna make up the story that you were found during a guerrilla expedition near the Gambia River. I'm gonna shave your head except for a little ponytailed tuft on top, and address you in a suit of fur. And you get up on that stage and grunt like an animal. Yeah, he was paid a dollar a day at first to not talk to grunt and I guess to play the violin really badly. Yeah. I didn't get was he paid a dollar a day to start? Okay? I thought that might have been part of the story that he was in fact paid a hundred dollars a day. Later he became a very popular um uh freak. I guess. Yeah. The thing is is um he Uh. William Henry Johnson was probably not microcephalic at all. Um he micro cephal microsophilic is totally different microcephalic. Um he. Actually they think now that he had just like a slightly abnormally shaped head that was exaggerated by the haircut that they gave him and that he actually had no diminished mental faculties once what what at all? And he was just pretending the whole time, and not only fooling crowds, but he was also fooling promoters. Yeah, because that's one of the hallmarks of that condition. Is I believe that usually it's accompanied by cognitive stunted cognitive development. Ye, usually very severe, but not in his case. He was super smart and when he died said we fooled them all. Yeah, that was his sister and his deathbed. They're also married. Not true. So he made a lot of money too, he did. He apparently retired with millions UM a millionaire, so he's not the only UM Again. Pinhead is what this specific type of freak was called. Man, I can't believe I just said that. This feels so wrong. I know, um, but there's a very side show performer and Chuck. Another very famous side show performer who was also I guess technically in the Under the Umbrella Pinhead, who actually was UM Micro's cephilic was Schlitze. Yes, Schlitze is one of my favorite people of all time. Yes, let's see, they don't know for sure his real name, but Um, they believe it's Simon Metz born in nineteen and one of the Bronx. And Um, by all accounts from everyone who ever met Schlitze, everyone loved Schlitze. And he was a ray of sunshine and a nice, sweet carrying, kind hearted man. Yes, loved life. Anything that you would take for granted. Um, Schlitze probably enjoyed the heck out of and Um. He was very frequently built as a woman. Um. I think he was bill as an Aztec warrior at first, and then maybe even an Aztec woman. But he wore dresses all the time because he was incontinent, and this just made it the whole thing easier. Um, So he was bill as a woman for a very long time, and including in the movie, Um Freaks, the Todd Browning movie from Schlitze was in that and Schlitze actually has like this big scene that's like has he has a whole speaking like a dialogue section, But to this day no one has any clue what he says. Yeah, should we talk about Freaks a now or take a break and then talk about it. Let's take a break, all right, all right, So the movie Freaks, Uh, I've seen it, have you I saw it for the first time this morning when most people see it. Uh. Yeah, it's a nineteen thirty two pre code film. Uh. There was a time between when um, they started making movies to four when the motion picture production code kicked in. Uh yeah and properly called the Hayese code. UM. For five years there you could do whatever you wanted, I guess. And uh that's when this director named Todd Browning made a movie called Freaks about sideshow performers. And this guy was he actually ran away that the director actually ran away and joined the carnival when he was sixteen and worked as a carnival barker and even uh participated in stunts and he was he's a circus guy. And he had a lot of um side show performers as friends. And you can tell in the movie that that's he's like, that's who he's whose side he's on, that's who that they're the heroes of the story with the protagonists antagonists or normals or whatever. Um and uh it's a really morally fraud movie these days. But if you just step back and and think of it as like this guy having an affinity for sideshow performers and giving them a shot at at stardom, being on the big screen for what they are, for who they are, for what they can do. Um. Then it's a really kind of a heart growing tale. Heart growing, yeah, in a very weird way. It's it's wrenching the watch. When's the last time you saw a college They spent a long time. Just see it again, all right, we'll check it out like it's it's tough to watch his gut wrenching. Uh. There are a lot of um, well, let's just talk about some of the performers in the movie. Um. One of them who stands out is Johnny eck John Eckhart Jr. Who was a twin and he was born with a condition. Uh. Everyone said that he was cut off at the waist. Uh. Not exactly true. We actually had um unusable underdeveloped legs that you never saw, but it appeared as though he didn't have anything from the torso down. And as from a young kid, I believe he was even walking on his hands before his twin brother was even standing. So he was very advanced in a lot of ways. A very smart guy. He's a painter. Uh yeah, very accomplished. The magician. Um, and you had a great personality too, you could tell. Yeah, and apparently he was good buddies with um Browning, and Browning always wanted him around and by his side and was like, you know, you need to come sit with me by the camera and almost like his Uh. I don't know if he like could consider him a co director, but he always wanted him nearby. Pretty neat Uh. Daisy and Violet Hilton, Yeah, can joined twins, right, yeah, which they called Siamese twins back in the day. Um, thanks to Chang and Yang bunker right. Yeah, they were actually uh some of the first super famous. Uh. They were from a Siamese fishing village and that's where the term came from. Yeah, Siam was what we now called Thailand. That's right, uh and Chang and Ing we're born in nineteen I'm sorry, eighteen eleven. And they actually performed on their own for many years, made a ton of money, They got married, had kids, moved to North Carolina of all places, and um that well actually interestingly, Daisy and Violet ended up in North Carolina too, Oh yeah, but under much much worse conditions. Yeah, but um to finish with Chang and Ang, they eventually lost their money. They were millionaires Losser Dough and then we'd worked for in him later on in life. But I get the impression that they did it kind of like at their leisure almost and ended up reamassing another fortune interest from working with Barnum. Yeah, and they fathered twenty one children between them, married to Paris sisters and can join. Each had a house. Then they would spend three days at one house, three days at the next house. Um and yeah, they had twenty one kids. Pretty amazing. So Daisy and Violet Hilton, they were known as Simeon twins back then. Of course, Uh, we don't use that German anymore, but I mean I remember that term when I was a kid. So it's definitely like held on for way too long. Remember Ronnie and Dinnie Galleon. Yeah, are they still with us? Let's find out. Well, you're you're checking that. I'll continue. Um, I believe that. Uh that Browning spotted Daisy and Violet and said, you guys are great, You're pretty, you can sing. You'll be a big part of my movie. And they they had been performers all along. Um. By eighteen, they were ontour with Bob Hope as part of his dance troup and made quite a bit of money. Um. But sadly their story into North Carolina because they made an appearance in at a midnight showing of Freaks at a drive in and their manager ditched them and this party don't get they had no way to leave North Carolina, so they just stayed there. Yeah, they had to get a job. That just seems odd to me. If you don't have any money and knowing to call to ask for money, you go get a job at a grocery store and I hope that you can eventually die there. It seems like they would have gotten enough money to leave and go back to wherever they live. Well, they died in Charlotte, North Carolina of the Hong Kong flu. What is that? It was a flu epidemic. She's that originated in Hong Kong. But it's a different world back then, Siamese twins died to Hong Kong flu. None of that seems politically correct to know. It doesn't who else was in Freaks? Uh, let's see, Um, there were a pair of little people named Harry and Daisy Earls, and they played Hans and frieda right, and Hans is like the ring master of the side show and um Frida. In real life, Daisy was known as the midget may West. Um. And in the movie they're engaged, but actually in real life they were a brother and sister. Yeah. And they were in the Wizard of Oz even as munchkins. And we're in a bunch of movies with Laurel and Hardy as well, So lifelong performers. So the the whole this whole movie. And again, um, we kind of we didn't finish with the schlitz Schlitzy was in it too and had this whole big speaking part. Um. It was just adorable in the movie. You could like Schlittsi's personality just shines right through the movie. Very likable. Yeah, and um Schlitze was actually uh adopted that no one had any idea who Schlitzy's biological family was. They were not around. So the um, the people he performed with and worked for, actually took care of him. And when his adopted father died, his father's daughter, biological daughter said hey, schlitzee, Um, I'm going to commit you to an asylum in Los Angeles. And that's where Schlitzy was until one day just by total chance. Chuck. Uh. Another circus performer, I think a sword swallower right named Bill Bill you're schlitz Yeah, what are you doing here? You look so sad, And Schlitzy was like, I remember you, let's go. So Bill Unk intervened and got Schlitzy out of the institution, and uh he got to live out his days hanging out in the park being recogniz eyes by passers by. Yeah, he lived near MacArthur Park in downtown l A. And uh lived all the way up until at age seventy one. Yeah, so you know you gotta see Schlitze. You should see freaks. But even if you don't see freaks, like, look up Schlitzy's part A, it'll probably make you want to see freaks. So Chuck, Um, the Freak Show is well. Some people say that it's still around and that it's just on TV in the form of reality shows. Like basically that same sentiment and everything still has found all over television. Yeah, exploiting uh people like uh, exploiting obesity and exploiting dwarf is um and uh, yeah it's on television now. Um. But the actual side show itself, Um, it's well, it went away in a lot of ways, at least as far as like a traveling side show went. And it went away with the rise of UM the rights for the disabled. That that that movement that came along in the starting in about the like late nineteenth century, early twentieth century, and then really gaining steam by about the time Freaks came around the movie. Yeah, there were a few things that kind of killed it, UM, but one's definitely, like you said, science invented it and killed it as And here's something that is sort of reprehensible that I found out. There's a lot of these uh uh side shows would try and keep doctors away from the people because they thought, I don't want a doctor coming in here and saying that the dog faced boy actually has hypertrichosis. Yeah, because and it's a condition where you have hair all over your face, because everybody he was a cave caveman, Yeah, exactly. Did you know? Actually there was another there was a woman UM named Julia Pastrana, and she had hypertrichosis too, and she ended up marrying her manager. They were married, they had a baby together, and she died during childbirth and and the baby was born still born, and her husband manager, who ostensibly loved her, said show must go on. So he mummified his wife and they're still born baby, and then took him around to display them in the side show as ever unbelievable. So uh again, doctors would come along and start explaining these things, and that helped kill the side show. The rise of television and uh, you know, at home entertainment meant people weren't going out to places like sideshows anymore. Yeah, they could stay in their house and watch television. And apparently you could still find sideshows like the American Horror Story. Was it freak Show last season or whatever. I don't watch that, but yeah, um it was setting I think the fifties, and I think at that time you could still see, you know, traveling sideshows here there, but they were pretty broken down by that point. They were pretty much gone. But by the sixties there was a girl named Carol Browning and she I all I could find is that she had deformed arms and legs. I don't know what that means, but that was the description that was given given of her. But she went to a side show and when she visited the carnival in North Carolina. I think she lived in Charlotte. No Rawleigh and Carol, what is it with North Carolina? That's where things beginning in with with sideshows. Well, Carol, Carol Grant I think was her name. Carol wrote a letter to the Agricultural Commission, and the Agricultural Commission is in charge of side shows at the time, at least in North Carolina, and said this is wrong, like, this is beyond wrong. I'm I'm offended by this and this this should not be allowed to happen. And she actually sparked a national conversation about whether side shows should be allowed to be around, even if performers wanted to be a part of them. And that was the final death knell that conversation. But a lot of people came out and said, hey, you know what these people, you guys call them freaks, but you also empty your pockets to them, and they're wealthy, they enjoy the acclaim, they enjoy the money, and um, it's actually you who has the problem. And it didn't have much of an effect. Sideshows went away, and a lot of the sideshow performers ended up going from being pretty wealthy or well paid or having a steady income to um being broke and ending up like being abandoned by their managers like Daisy and Violet. Yeah, it's a tricky ground. It is. It's pretty much sad all the way through except for some success stories. And that makes the whole thing so morally ambiguous if you think about it, Like, it's just so easy to look from here and be like you named your movie freaks or you you you charge people to look at the elephant man. But what about those people who say, I'm cool with this, I'm signing on for this. This is making a lot of very wealthy. I'm happy. I've I've had all sorts of opportunities that weren't open to me before, and I love what I do. What do you do about that? Like, you can't condemn it. It's not an easy black and white thing to to deal with. Yeah, it's called a moral ambiguity. You said it that There have always been them, them, those them moral ambiguity. There always will be. Uh, you got anything else? No, if you want to know more about sideshows, freaks, that kind of thing, you can type those words into the search part how stuffworks dot Com. And since I said search parts not for listener mail. Hey, before listener mail, what about Ronnie and Donnie? Oh yeah, Ronnie and Donnie are alive. Awesome. They are sixty four years old as of past October I think twenty one, and they are the world's longest living conjoined twins. They're adorable too, they're oh hi ends right, yeah, very nice. What what documentary did we see on them or something? I can't remember, but we've we talked about him a lot over the years, So that's that's great news. But they're they're still at it all right, So listener mail. I'm gonna call this one, uh quick feedback on the Bill Gates podcast. That is quick turnaround. Hey, guys, my name is Brendan Cologne announced like Cologne, and I'm a PhD student at Habba Medical School in Pamelas Silver's lab working on artificial photosynthesis. Shoutout Pamelas Silver. How about that. I'm a long time fan of the show and wanted to say what you guys did? You did? You did a great job covering renewable energy with Phil Gates. During the episode, there was a question about the current limitations of artificial photosynthetic systems at present, the biggest issues are scalability, he cost energy in producing the building materials, and the efficient extraction of produced rules. Uh. These are standard engineering hurdles, but like Mr Gates said, we can call them Bill by the way, I don't think you can, Brendon, we can, but we can. Uh. These are standard engineering hurdles, but like Mr Gates said, the final product needs to be viable. Specifically, such a product would need to harvest in store more energy in the short term than what was required to build it makes sense and do so on the cheap. Uh. Fortunately, biotechnology and photo voltaic technology is advancing at a breakneck pace, so the future of this technology looks bright. As new biochemistries are discovered, more products will be available for production, and one vision of this technology is a local and individualized production chemicals on demand. I hope this helps. Feel free to reach out. Cheers Brendon, Thanks Brendon. Yeah, Brendon Cologne pronounced cologne. That's right. Uh.
