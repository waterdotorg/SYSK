Josh: Brought to you by the Reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff You Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Bryant. This Stuff you Should Know? Oh and hey Jerry, Sorry, Jerry. Jerry is the unsung hero heroin Yes, a little horse for a little monkey? Why it's an old Mr Science Theater three thousand long? Oh you through there? I thought she had a little horse and a little monkey or something under her. Wo be like, Jerry, what do you tell me? A little horse and a little bit a pony and a macaque with her? So? Uh yeah, that's how we're starting this one. Why not? Okay, all right, Chuck, I have a pretty decent intro this time. Well let's hear it then. Have you ever heard of the lost Colony of roan Oak? I have, but I would like you too. You fill us in? Thank you. So back in the I think seventeenth century the early seventeenth century, Roanoke was one of the very first colonies, if not the first American colony right um in what is now North Carolina, Virginia, right, um. And it was thriving for a little while. They had a nice little four and they used to fight with the Native Americans and you know, pretty normal early American colonial stuff. Right. So, like I said, everything is going happily along. And then about two years after the colony is established, an expedition bringing supplies comes along and they find the thing totally abandoned, no sign of life. I don't believe there is any dead bodies or bones, um. And the only trace of anything was the word crow a town carved into one of the posts that made up the fort. You're kidding, And I think there were some There was there was a local tribe called the crow Towan, but they were nowhere to be found. Isn't it very creepy? This whole colony law just vanished. I thought you can say wolverines was spray painted on the front of it. But the they think now that they may have been absorbed by another tribe, the Lumbi, which actually um were completely alien to whites until I think the early eighteenth century, very late, like several decades after the colony at Roanoke vanish, right, um. And when the Whites didn't counter and they said Hey, um, why does some of you look kind of white? And why are you building two story thatch houses like we have in England? Right? You know, how do you know how to read the Bible? Right? Um? With this ball? Exactly? They think so they think that the Lumbie tribe absorbed the colonists at Rohanu. Wow, but that is among the very few lost colonies of human history. I'll tell you another species that has tons of lost colonies. Bees, dude, best set up ever? Really, yeah, of course, really really good. Yes, Josh, we are here today to talk about colony collapse disorder because bees are disappearing at an alarming rate, much like the people of the rowan Oute colony. Right, and Chuck, I think that probably most of the people who listen to our podcast said, why do I care that bees are disappearing? I hate bees? They sting me and they they chase me in my dreams. You know, you know why I do? Why you want me to tell them? Because bees are vital to almost any kind of vegetation you can eat. And not only that. Let's say you're like, I don't need vegetables I eat and meat? Did you know? Here? Let me let me give you a little scenario that was posed in this article take the almond population. Let's for example, my new favorite nut, as you know, is the almond chucks. Crazy about all they're so good for you. Um. Beekeepers basically go to California every year with about forty billion honey bees too, uh, pollinate the almond crop every February. Every February, and over those few weeks of the world's almond crop is pollinated and about a billion dollars in exports are generated. So you might think, okay, well, I don't eat almonds either, tough guy. Those almonds the almond holes are sold as cattle feed. Part of the cattle feed. They're also crushed as shells for bedding for livestock, and the dust, almond dust is collected as an additive to the top soil, so that hamburger has almond juice running through it, which has bee juice running through it. Yeah, and that's just almonds. Yeah. I think a total of fifteen billion dollars worth of agricultural products are pollinated by commercial honey bees every year, every year, and we s that bees are disappearing. Um, mostly it's honey bees that are disappearing. Under the colony claps disorder, right, chuck, Yeah, specifically, that's what we're worried about. So it is important obviously honey bees are kept happy and healthy and um that they not mysteriously vanished without a trace. Yeah, it's not just about honey, folks. Let's although honey is delicious, it is delicious and nutrition. Let's talk about what colony claps disorder is, chuckers, Okay, uh, I think they. I think Jessica Toothman said in this article that attrition rates in a bee colony is normal because bees do have wings and they will fly away, and about is an average of what you're looking for. I think it's like an average maximum average maxim because I mean, when you let the bees out go pollinate, some are just gonna be like, I like this colony or I think I'm going to um go hit the road with Neil Cassidy or something. Right. You know, they don't always come back, that's true. Uh, And so starting as early as two thousand two, but really in two thousand six is when it really really peaked, or not peaked, but when it really showed its ugly face. The bees started leaving and not coming back. At it, and we suspect dying at a rate of anywhere from thirty that's huge. And do you remember you said a minute ago that every February about forty billion bees. That's in just one million hives. So if of a hive is dying off or it is a lot of bees, the just one hive, which we should probably specify, is virtually interchangeable with the word colony. Hi, haven't call any same thing. Yeah, you know what's creepy? What is sometimes when they when they come back and they see the all the vs the bees are gone. Sometimes you'll just see the queen and larvae and a few younger bees and that's it. And they're like, where's everybody gone? And maybe crow uh, what's over it again? Croat? Maybe crowatons like scrawled into the bee hive in honey. Yeah. Um, so yeah, that's colony cleps disorder most of the most of the time, it's the workers are just gone vanished, or at least of them, right, um. And what I guess another kind of interesting and almost unsettling aspect is that when a when a bee hive gets abandoned and all its left is like the queen and some larvae and and especially when there's tons of honey in it, moths, um, other kinds of bees, wasps, any other insect with the taste for sweet, sweet honey, beetle vades it immediately. Not so with colonies that have been hit by colony collapse disorder. Yeah, they wait a few days, right, Yeah they do. That's creepy. It's real creepy. That'd be like leaving some steak out in the hot sun in July and they're being like no flies or animals buzzing around right until like the following Thursday. That's really creepy. Yeah, and it definitely gives you an idea that something serious is up, right, So we have mystery, mystery, mystery, tons of bees dying or vanishing. Um. And like you said, check, this really stepped up. Been two thousand and six, seven and eight, right, and it's still going on. From what I understand, this is not the first time that this happened though, Yeah, you said it was the worst case ever. Was when it's not the worst. I think this is the worst case ever. But before it's been pretty bad. Uh uh. In Pennsylvania, um beekeepers reported fifty three percent of their hives just knocked out. Spanish gone um or dead. Uh. We have um mysterious bee hive abandonments uh dating back to the eighteen eighties, the early twentieth century. Um. And in nineteen oh three in Utah, Uh, two thousand colonies were mysteriously lost. Yeah, just gone. So this isn't if you'll notice it's Utah, Pennsylvania here or there. You know, with colony collapse disorder, it's spread around. There's there's there's evidence of it in Australia, in Europe, in the US. Yeah. Actually Australia said they've been doing Okay, okay, well there's evidence of it in not Australia, but the US I apologize. Australia did say they had reported. But things seem to be back on track in Australia, So you were right? Should I say it again? Now you just smack me? All right? So chuck the apiarists? You like that? Very nice? This is another word for beekeeper are getting a little bit concerned. It's widespread, the numbers are high. It's mysterious. What possibly is going on here? Well they're not quite sure, Josh. That's why it's a little distressing. I know this mystery of the vanishing. They do have some ideas, and after reading this article and a few other UH supplementary articles, my belief is that it's a combination of factors. It's probably not one thing. Yeah, And actually the U s D A Steering committee on Colony collapse disorder, it's a mouthful. They just released their first UM, I guess white paper on colony collapse disorder this past July, and they concluded the same thing. I real that there's a bunch of different factors at work. UM. There were some ideas thrown out, like some unknown organism or pathogen was acting them. They said probably not. There's a study done in Germany UM as to whether or not cell phone and cell phone towers were putting off radiation that was screwing with the bees homing abilities and this. Uh. These Germans did that study and they said no, not happening. And apparently the opposite was picked up by the news cycle to the point where the guy who conducted the study wrote the A p. A letter saying we found no link between colony collapse disorder and cell phones. Anybody who says or writes anything else is a liar. But they were linking that and journalists were linking that. Journalists loved it. Link stuff. Yeah, correlative not causative. Let's talk about a couple of these things, Josh, alright, Let's talk about the Israeli acute paralysis virus. This seems to be the most important factor. If there's several factors involved in colony claps disorder, this seems like right at the top. I would agree, Uh, just from reading about it. It It is a virus discovered by Israeli scientists in two thousand two, and it causes trembling, paralysis and death and bees, which is it just makes me really sad to think about a trembling paralyzed and then dying. Be What's cool, um, is that they these researchers in the study in two thousand seven, UM, I guess introduced I A p V into some hives and then kept some other ones separate, um, so that they wouldn't become infective. Because honey bees are very social and they frequently interact with bees from other colonies. Um. But they infected them in this greenhouse, creepy, and then as the bees were dying, the researchers noted that the healthy bees were dragging the dead ones to the outskirts of the greenhouse as far away from the high as they could, quarantining these dead bees. It is that seems to me to be a real red flag here. You know what else that when they um studied some there was another study in two thousand and seven that looked at already infected um colony collapse disorder hives and then non CCD hives, and they found that in nineties six point one percent of the infected hives I A p V was present, but it wasn't in any of the non c c D hives. So it's definitely a huge factor that seems like it, but not case closed because there are some other factors that may weigh in as well. Pesticides is a big one, specifically, Chuck the neo nicotinoid. Nice people knew that. It took twenty minutes for us to spit that out, they laugh. Uh, they are neurotoxins, Josh. And they are pesticides and they're used to protect crops against pests, which honey bees as well. Yeah, and um, I think the Germans, once again, the beekeepers in Germany are blaming this for massive die off rates, right, the same Germans who said that the cell phones had nothing to do with it, so much so that some countries are starting to ban this type of pesticide um even though I don't think there's been any causal link established, it's the correlations enough that, right, you know, do you want to hear the saddest factor? For me? It's sad, But at the same time, I imagined some be in like a crumpled fedor carrying a briefcase returning to the hive, you know, Joe versus the b the bee hive. I love that movie me too. Uh, stress, Josh, is what we're talking about. And these poor little bees because of beekeeper stretching out the pollination season, basically giving bees less time to recuperate before carrying them around to another crop. They're overworked and they're stressed out, and it could be, you know, disrupting their immune systems and killing them off. Sad, sad, sad. And then the last factor in the article that was mentioned as impossible culprit was the verroa might what's the deal with these suckers? They actually transmit I A p V two okay, um bees, Well, there you have it. Through little jerks, little jerky mites. So the like we said, fifteen billion dollars worth of agricultural crops products in the US alone. We're pollinated by commercial honey bees. So you can imagine that the U. S. D A Is a little worried about colony claps disorder. Right. Yeah, they're actually looking to alternative methods of pollinating, like synthetic methods of pollinating plants because of this, uh naked guys running through the fields. That's one and the other bees are trying to put other bees to work, Like which one was it, the blue orchard bee? Yeah, they're seeing if that works. Uh, And then of course they're also trying to do what they can to take care of the honey bees and restore their population. Um, but it's not just the U. S. T A That has a hand in honey bee repopulation. No, no, no, it's you and I too, Chuck, You and I and Hoggendoz. Oh yeah, well, we're gonna give you some tips here in a minute on what you can do as an individual. But I did want to point out that Delicious Haggandas ice Cream has has nearly fifty of their all natural ice creams it sounds like I'm reading an ad because it's from their website. Nearly fifty of them use honey bees in some way, shape or form to get their ultimate ingredient. So they've got a little deal going where they ultimate ingredients. Well there's fifty of them. Okay, well now sorry. Uh. They have created a special flavor called Vanilla Honeybee and they call it a delicious tribute to these essential creatures. And of course when you buy this this kind or any of them that have the ingredients that come from the honey bees help they donate some money. Cool, which is pretty cool. And you can donate just straight to a cause via the cause via the Hagganda site, or you can be nice to your local apiarists and maybe having a bad day and that could just help, right, sure, that would help. UM. So we have we have some tips for you, Josh, you want to go over some of these. My favorite is um contact your member of parliament and tell them to start funding bee research. For you to contact your member of parliament throw their wig at me the number one on the list of and this is clearly England, but imagine you can do the same things here. This has become a beekeeper. That's a good one. Sure, cool job. The more hives the better, unless they're infected, and then the opposite is true. Yeah. Another thing you can do is protect swarms. If you see a swarm of honey bees, don't go out there with the can of raid or your can of hairnet and a lighter. Yeah, that's that's even the worse idea. You You should contact um, a local authority, and supposedly they will contact a beekeeper that will come and round them up. You want to make sure that they're going to contact the beekeeper. Actually there's people who do swarm removals and just kill all the bees. Yeah, you want to make sure that they're going to be taken to a hive by a beekeeper and then the guy comes out with this can of raid and the lighter some local redneck. Uh. Plant your garden with bee friendly plants. This is the biggest one that you can actually make an impact here at home. So we're talking single flowering plants and vegetables, and they recommend the Aliam family meant beans except for French beans, and flowering herbs and bees especially like daisy shape flowers, so sunflowers, sunflowers, are big, are really big for helping to uh, helping the honey bees out. And if you have your hands in your pockets right now and you're feeling nothing but lint, and you're like, I really love to help the bees, but I can't afford any sunflower seeds. Man, I'm not like rich. You can actually contact a group called the Great Sunflower Project and they'll send you some seeds. Uh. In return, all they ask is that you spend h thirty minutes twice a month. If you can't swing that, then you need to take stock of your life, um thirty minutes twice a month in the garden. Uh, noting arrival times, departure times, and uh whether or not you even see any bees on your sunflowers and sending sending in the information. Yeah, exactly, because if you don't see any bees, that's really important to tell them as well. Right. And don't use pesticides mid date chuck. Oh is that a big one. Yeah, Well, that's when bees are most likely to be out foraging. So if you're gonna spray any kind of pesticide, don't do it in the middle of the day. It's bad news. Right. They also say, if you're going to use pesticides or pest control to use insects specific pesticides, So don't buy kill all and don't buy kills honey bees. Yeah, exactly a few other gardening tips for you. I know you're quite the gardener. Uh. They say, if you have space to use ten or more bee plants in a group, you can group them together. That's a good thing. Sure makes pollination easier. Sure, and if not, you know, do what you can plan as many as you can. Uh. They also require water when they're foraging in your garden, so you know, put out a little bird bath and if you don't have a bird bath, maybe just a dish of water in your garden. I didn't know that, did you. I did not. It's a good one. And they also um burrow in the ground, so they say not to completely mulch your entire garden, to leave some bare areas maybe where you don't see it, or maybe put a little mound of sand and the bees can home down in there. So another little tip you can use. And native plants are always good if you're a gardener, plant native plants to your state because bees eat them up. And aside from gardening, you can also buy local honey. You know. I used to know an apiarist and related him once for the Henry County Times when I edited it, and um, he sold local honey. I got stung by a bee, by the way, while I was interviewing him, really hurt man um and uh. Like three years later, I was at someone's house, a friend's house, and they just happen to have honey from this guy's farm. I couldn't believe it. Yeah, if your city is like um, Atlanta, then they're all manner of farmers markets. That story sounded so much more interesting in my head before I spit it out. I thought it was interesting. Things can't tell by the way edges breeze right over. Uh. If at as like your town, you probably have all kind of farmers markets, local markets, and I guarantee you there will be somebody with honey. It does. And they say, if you're into um immunology, uh, and you believe that you can immunize yourself from uh local allergies using honey, which is yet to be proven, but it makes a lot of sense. You want to buy honey that's um created within fifteen miles of your your house and buying the local is always a good idea all across the board. And I got one more unless you have one more? No, I'm done, okay, because I want to finish with this and it's so good. Uh. Under the heading be friendly, some tips on you know, if you have bees in your area, don't swat them, don't flap your hands around. Just stay calm and move slowly away into the shade, they say, and bees will lose interest. They also don't have as much interest if you smell like alcohol or leather, and they regard regard dark clothing as a threat. So put on some dark leather pants, get drunk, and hang out in your garden. Apparently I will never get stung by a being. Wow, I'd like to see that. If you want to learn more about this mysterious colony collapse disorder, you can read just k Toothman's fascinating article how colony collapse disorder works. I imagine if you type in collapse disorder or colony collapse or colony collapse disorder into the handy search bar at how stuff work dot Com, it will yield said article. Uh. In the meantime, let's do some listener mail, Josh. These are two from two kids. And you know, we like the kid emails because they're always nice and super friendly and cute and not like a cynical old rotten adults. So the first one is from Betto, which I love. That name, Betto is what is that Italian Portuguese? I would think it's Italian. Okay, hey guys, my name is Betto pronounced b et Dash. Oh. I know you're laughing, it's a laugh. I have listened to every single one of your podcasts since the eighth grade, and I am now a sophomore in high school. Now. Doesn't that really put it in perspective? Yeah? I feel old. All of a sudden people are actively We're seeing these people grow up. This is it brings a tear to my eye. You know, when we get a graduation imitation from Sarah the eleven year old fan, then it's time to hang it up, all right, he says. Beto says, I have to wake up every morning at six am to catch the bus at seven so I can go to a school thirty minutes away from my house. It's about an hour bus ride, that's how that works. And all I can do is listen to my iPod every day, I download two or more and prepare for my day, and you have two. You two have become quite possibly my two favorite heroes besides Matt Bellamy, who I had to look that up. Who isn't He's the lead singer of Muse. So where heroes along with this muse dude? Because every morning I'm sitting on that crowded bus with loud people and I can listen to you two talk about a random subject, including ones that sound boring at first, but thanks to you, I learned something and get a few us along the way. You're the coolest guys I know, kind of since I don't actually know you, he says, and I hope that you guys never quit doing this. Your number one fan for real? Betto, well, oh no, he he follows. He follows up for you specifically. He says, Josh, You're amazing and I have a man crush on you. But I have a girlfriend, so you know, ha ha, she doesn't know, that's what he says. Wow, I know, did Betto just come onto me? I think? So? Alright? Betto actually says he would be an all shock if you read this on the air, but I doubt you will, so I'm kind of I think Betto just used for verse psychologist. So this Betto kid is sharp, just got punked by a tenth grader. Al Right, here's another quickie from Nick and Alfaretta. Nick is eight seventeen and Alfaretta, Georgia, and he has written us before, but he had a personal tie to Edward of Woodstock from the Mercenaries podcast. He was his great great great et cetera grandfather. How about that? Well pretty cool, huh. He says, I know this because well that's what he put. He didn't know how many greats it was. And he knows this because they have a family tree and he was right near the beginning of it. And after he was Edward of Woodstock, he became Edward Prince of Wales. Oh yeah, and then and that's what he says at least, and he goes in details a little bit of Edward of Woodstocks life and just says that thanks for mentioning, and he's related to him. Very cool right here in Georgia, yeah, and al Florida. It's right up the road, a piece, right up the road. Well, thank you Betto and Nick. We appreciate both of you guys for writing in, and we love all of you who right in, and by love I mean really appreciate and are fond of.
