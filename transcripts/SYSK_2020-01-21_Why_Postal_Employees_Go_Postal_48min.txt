Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should Know, a production of My Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. Oh Boys, can be a long year. I'm Josh, there's Chuck, there's Jerry over there, and this is stuff you should know. May be long year, that the year is always the same length. I almost forgot the word podcast in the intro. That's an indicator it's gonna be a long year. We're only going to do subjectively. We're only going to do this a hundred more times. Yeah, but we just did one and three, so a hundred more d one more. I think we do a hundred and four a year, do we? Jerry? Yeah, because it's fifty two weeks times two. That's what I meant, So we've done one. I was just joking by hundred two more. Look bored, That's what I'm saying, Long year, buddy. Jerry's got on her principal shoes. She does. Josh just made Jerry walk up and down the hall so I could hear the clip clop of her of a wooden heel, and it definitely made me like I had a little PTSD of like, oh boy, someone's coming after us. It sounded like the principal was coming and we were in the office. We were smoking in the boys room, which I never did. I never did either, man, even when I was a high school smoker, I was like, are you out of your mind? Smoking the lobby in the I'd like escape, you know, campus the smoke or whatever. Was there a smoking section at your now, I wasn't that. What am I like your age? I don't think there was by the time I got there either, but I definitely remember maybe the first year or so. But I definitely remember when my sister was at my high school, she's six years older, there was a smoking area by the dumpster and like that's where they had a roped off her students could go smoke, and they're crazy, it's awesome. They're like, hey, we know it's a long day. If you need to go, if you need to go light up, just do it over here. That's the official place. Yeah, you need to go cool it up cools, yeah, or go feel alive with pleasure this newport. Yeah. I think so. I did smoke on a plane a couple of times. I was on one flight that I remember that had smoking, an international flight, and it was like, it's crazy. Yeah, there's no barrier, no partition, no nothing. It's just these are the roads that you consider in and smoke, which is all based the whole plane is a smoking section. Yeah, point, it is crazy. It's always funny when I see movies where people are smoking on busses and planes and restaurants, and it's really different time, different day, different era. Speaking of a different time, I guess it qualifies as a different time. Um, I think today, Chuck, that we should talk about in the era when people went postal trite and I'm looking at something up relevant. By the way, I'm not just checking my email right now. Well, I'll tap dance for us. Then. Well, I was just curious if there was a band called Going Postal, not if, but how many there were. And I just typed in going Postal band, and uh, I see quite a few Facebook pages called going Postal band, Twitter accounts going postals, some with an end with a little apostrophe going postal. Those are the little more loosey goosey, like Jimmy Buffett style, like yacht rocky. Yeah so yeah, of course people would take something horrific like workplace shootings and turn it into a band name. Dude, not only a band name. There's a franchise of male centers like where you get your mail sent to called going postal or got really nationwide franchise. Interesting, any article that you read about the post office, it will be called like going postal. Like it's completely been co opted and removed from his context, so much so that I would guess our younger listeners aren't fully aware of where that whole thing comes from. Yeah, And I think not that it's cool and acceptable, but I think the reason it's even allowed to happen to name things this now is because we are now in an era where that term uh as we'll learn in this podcast, and we've talked about the golden age of skyjacking and the golden age of this and that there was a weird golden age of postal workers shooting up their workplaces and it hasn't happened that much since then. And so that's what I think has allowed people to be like, hey, good band name. Huh. So I think because no one would call a band school shooter now, you know, because that's the active horrific thing going on. But it's the same thing. And you could make a really good argument or case that it grew out of the shooting. These were the first workplace mass shootings that America is exposed to. And I would put to you not that people don't shoot up post offices any longer, but that when it does happen, it is no longer even remotely as newsworthy as it once was, because at the beginning, we didn't understand what the heck was going on. Now we understand firsthand, all of us, anybody who has a job in America now understands what's going on. And it's also spread from beyond the post office into offices around the country, businesses around the country, and even into schools. Some people, yeah, some people make the argument that neoliberalism is to blame, and I'm okay with that, and that will explore that more later. Yeah, liberalists, did you like I'm trying new things in the two thousand twenty? Uh? Did you practice your delivery or all? Right? Well, but I nailed it. I think I think so too. I know that podcast on is looming on neoliberalism. It's long been on your list, So just a matter of getting around to it. I don't know how, maybe how about five years from now? Alright? Within the next five years, let's say that if we are still blessed enough to be doing this job. You keep saying that because apparently every time you do ten years passes and everybody's like, aren't can you believe that you even said that? So I just keep saying that because I want to keep doing this. I think it's gonna neat to think about, like having a twenty plus year partnership. Like there might be a podcasting Hall of Fame one day we can go visit it exactly, look at Mark Marin and uh, Karen and Georgia. Maybe they'll give us a senior discount. All right, So we should talk about and did you write this one? Actually no, Dave Rouse did. Oh man, he did a great job. And the way he put together the story I think works. Well, we're gonna follow this format. Why not? Uh, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's right, that's my mom tra And how long are you going to do that? It's like January, gonna do it all this month? So he starts off with a story of a man named Patrick Henry Cheryl, forty four year old man in Oklahoma City. His known in his neighborhood as crazy pat. He was a big dude. He was a loner um. He had a lot of He ticked a lot of boxes when it comes to mass shootings. He was basically like Pile from full mental jacket when he was in Yeah, it sounds like, yeah. He was a loner um. He had been caught as a peeping tom um. He hurt animals. He would tie cats and dogs defenses with baling wire. Not nice at all. He was shy, he was awkward, didn't have a lot of friends. He joined the Marine Corps, which is where he learned how to shoot que private Pile once again. And then after the Marines, he moved on with his mom and when she died in he was alone with his Ham radio. I don't want to throw any shade at Ham Radio, at the Hams out there, because remember we found out in our episode on Ham radios that like they are the most courteous, that's right, like civic minded people around. So this is a bad apple, right right. He doesn't exemplify the Ham radio community. And I didn't even want to mention that, but the idea of him alone with his Ham radio bears mentioning it. You can't obfuscate the truth. He's got to bring it out, address it, and then you know, keep going. That's the man. In eighty four he enlisted in the National Guard of Oklahoma. Uh. And in he started work, as you know what, a postal carrier in Edmund, Oklahoma. Right. So, he Um, by all accounts, was a I don't know if disturbed is the right word, but maybe it is. Certainly it's a less balanced individual than than probably the average person for sure. Um. So when he was told that he Um was going to be fired if he didn't shape up, he wasn't super great at his job now, he wasn't according to his supervisors. He would deliver mail the wrong address. Um, he would be late to work a lot, and he was given a notice like you're gonna be fired if you don't, if you don't start doing what we want you to. Uh. The next day he showed up to work and without saying a word. This is what makes this one so creepy, he went to his supervisor, he went to find the postmaster and he shot them without saying a word. And he started moving around his workplace at this Edmund, Oklahoma post office, and within fifteen minutes had killed fifteen people, including himself. Yeah. Um. Side note one of those people was the grandson of Notre Dame football coach New Rockney. Um. People were locking themselves in vaults. Uh, they survived, so he didn't kill everyone in the office, which you might be asking, why is the post office have a vault stamps? Yeah, they really care about those stamps. They do valuable. They are people hiding in offices and under their desks, and by the time the swat team gets there, they find him dead at his desk. He went to his desk and killed himself. Right, So fifteen minutes, killed fifteen people, including himself, and did it without saying a word. From what all people are saying. Yeah, and this was, um, one of the bloodiest events in American history mass shootings at the time. Um, there were a couple before this, but this was pretty early on in mass shootings. Um. Yeah, America had not really been fully acquainted with mass shooting. Kid. They were so rare, so rare that they were huge, huge, huge stories. And they also seemed like total anomalies, not the very beginnings of a pattern that was starting to emerge. That's not what people thought of these things at the time. They you couldn't. If you go back and like watch Dan Rather reporting on this, he can't make heads or tails of it. It's just the most senseless thing. That's what they use. Senseless, nonsensical, insensible, like they just couldn't understand it. Yeah. The one um, of course, the famous sixties six clock tower sniper and at the University of Texas. Have you ever seen that documentary on that. It's done in like the animation, through the animation software like in Waking Life, and somehow it makes it even more disturbing. I have not seen that, but I'm gonna see it because this stuff fascinates me. UMO one, I don't know if we should ever cover that one. The one that mcdonald'son California was just horrific. That and the difference between that one and most of these take place over it always seems like it's like six minutes, ten minutes, twelve minuts. The one at the McDonald's was seventy seven minutes of just bloodshed and shooting. It was awful, It was so uh, but they were still anomalies. They were anomalies. And this was the first one that took place in an office. The New York Daily News said, Cheryl put a new wrinkle to this kind of violence. He brought it into the office, right, So he was not the first postal carrier to come to his workplace and shoot up the place, right. Um, he he targeted like the back office. But there there have been a couple before I saw, even going back into the seventies, where postal workers had come to work and shot the place up, usually targeting a supervisor. Yeah, and it's it was never this many people, I think was one of the big differences. That's a huge difference. Yeah. The one in South Carolina, three I think, was just one person um killed with the twelve gauge. The postbaster barricaded himself in a storage room I ronically of a convenience store. You'll see why later. So just put a pin in that, but was actually killed in the convenience store across the street. Yeah, and actually it wasn't just him. There were other people barricaded in that convenience store storage room with him, but he was the only one he shot. And that's a pattern that started to emerge. The more people started looking into these things, the more they were like a lot of these are They're not random. These guys let people live that they could have easily killed, and they went out of their way to find people who they did kill or tried to kill. And a lot of times it would be their supervisor or the postmaster, somebody who was in charge of bossing them around, or possibly a co worker who had you know, um, gotten a promotion instead of them. Yeah, that happened specifically in one case, and another guy was stalking a co worker and he came to work, UM, and I think he didn't end up killing her, Is that right? No, he killed killed a male employee instead. So by the time this Edmunds, Oklahoma, a lot of people will point to that is like, that's not the first postal shooting. This is the one that really started to catch everybody's attention. Yeah, from eighty six to ninety nine, there were fifteen different incidences or incidents, But you were right by the way, I know, but it's just a mouthful. Um. That involved current or former postal workers killing coworkers thirty four people over a thirteen year period, which included that fourteen in Oklahoma. Yeah, a lot of people point to is the peak of the going postal era, not even necessarily because of all the bloodshed that year, I mean there were some in ninety three, but more just the way that it leached into the cultural consciousness by that time, I think was when it first appeared in print. To write. Ninety three was when it appeared in print in the St. Petersburg, Florida Times. And ironically, they were talking about a symposium on workplace violence that was sponsored by the United States Postal Service, and the article says, um which has seen the US Postal Service has seen so many outbursts that in some circles, excessive stress is known as going postal. This is that same year Seinfeld debuted I think they debuted Newman as a character, and they basically said he's a postal worker and referenced postal workers going crazy. Sure, um, who would you who would you like to be? I'll be Newman? Okay, who are you? I gotta be George? Then, I mean you had to tell the people that's what I mean. Oh, I see, I thought you were presenting me with a fake choice. Now let me this is George. Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living? Newman? That's my George? I mean United States postal worker. Aren't those of the guys that always go crazy. He come back with a gun and shoot everybody sometimes remember that scene, so do I went and looked at it. There's actually more to it. Did. They ask him why, and Numan actually explains it, and there's actually a lot of water to his explanation. It will turn out, he says, the mail never stops. Mail never stops, right, it's always coming. It's always and then it's publisher's clearing house weak or something like that. He's like it never. They have to like snap him out of like this tirade that he goes on. But it's it's actually supposedly part of what was responsible for this phenomenon, the ceaseless pressure to constantly move the mail as fast as possible. I've been watching Seinfeld a lot lately. Yeah, yeah, what do you think? It's great? It holds up pretty well, holds up pretty well. Yeah, it's it's and it's funny to hear Larry David um because this was before I knew. I knew he created Seinfeld, but before Curbs, so I didn't know what he looked like or sounded like. And he's his voice a lot like he's a voice of Steinbren and there's a couple of other things, like they'll just be a random off screen line and it's Larry David and now watching it, it just cracks me up. It's but yeah, it holds it pretty well. Obviously, it's some of it. We're in different times now. Some of it's kind of like untoward but not too bad. Okay, I'll just say that, Yeah, it was. It was the nineties. No, I know, it's a different era, different era, and that was even the emergence of the PC era. But compared to today, it's it's like like you can't see that kind of stuff. Um, should we take a break or you got I got one more cultural reference. There was a um, there was a Simpsons and I don't know what year it came out, but I'll bet it was around where, um, Flanders and Homer become like best friends because Flanders takes Homer to a football game and Flanders learns that he can't stand Homer. It doesn't like to be around him, and he has a dream where where he climbs a clock tower with a gun and starts shooting at Everybody's like, there's Homer, there's another Homer. There's Homer, and one of the people he shoots at is a postal carrier who drops his mail bag and produces like an assault rifle and starts shooting back. And it's just the most casual thing that requires zero explanation whatsoever, because by this time everyone knew going postal mail carriers. They're not just like some friendly guy who you know, gets you know, chased off by a dog every once in a while is the worst thing that happens. This guy is like on the verge of cracking and killing everybody, and he comes to my house every day, like what is going on? And this is when that kind of started to really rise to the surface, that that question. Yeah, and like you hinted at, I'm glad you picked this because it's there. Uh. As it turns out there is something to it. It wasn't just coincidence. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in other cases spread after this. All right, So, like we said, most of these killings occurred roughly over eighty six to about ninety seven UM, but they date back to eighty three and as late as two thousand six UM. One of another big famous one was Thomas McIlvaine. He was in Michigan. Yeah, Royal Loac, Michigan, just above Detroit. Yeah. This guy was martial arts enthusiast and he was in the Marine Corps as well, and he was discharged dishonorably for running over a car with a tank. Okay, so I was watching I read that as cat by the way. The first like three times I read this running over a cat with the tad, I was like, oh my god, but it was a carcharged him not as bad unless there was a cat in the car to he was driving. Yeah, tuneses knew about going postal. Um. So there's a documentary out there called Murdered by Proxy How America Went postal, And they go to great lengths to to basically say Thomas McIlvaine was not totally off his rocker, like he was considered by his coworkers. Still today, people who were there when he came and shot up the place, victims of his shooting. Still some of them will say, I don't condone what he did, but I totally understand it. And when he was yes, because he was treated so poorly by the management and so aggressively poorly and hostily that that they basically said like this was just a powder kig waiting to happen. And when they heard that this was going on, they didn't know who it was not. They said, like, we didn't just think I was Tom Tom McIlvaine. They said, it could have been any one of us because this this, this, this was so toxic there. So, yes, it's easy to characterize him as a wing nut because he shot up his post office and killed a bunch of people. But there are other people who were there who say, that's that's that's not a full picture of of who he was. Yeah. I mean if there's a situation where there is a um, a workplace shooting and a hundred percent of the people don't go, oh, well it was this guy, uh, then it might bear looking into the to the workplace environment. Again not condoning in any way, but it's like he it's just interesting to think about and once we see the reports that came out later, like I said, there are some weight to some of this stuff. UM ninety three, I mean mclevaine, I guess we should say, um in six minutes, killed four people, wounded for others, killed himself. He let off a hundred rounds of shells in six minutes. That's I can't imagine what that must have been. Like. Dude, that my Donald's guy had an oozy I know, I I there are very few people that I hate, but I hate that man. I hate him. Yea, it was. He was a despicable human being. Yeah. So ninety three was and I remember this actually, Um, there were two post office shootings on the same day. I remember I was in college at the time, and it was in the middle of the going postal era, all the headlines and I remember two of them happened on the same day, and it was almost I mean, it was horrific, but it was almost like this weird, like you gotta be kidding me. Yeah, exactly. Um, And you know this was back pre widespread internet even, and it was still like a big deal on campus, everyone talking about. Yeah. I can imagine, um, because I think it confirmed this general suspicion that had been confirmed officially that there's something going on and there's something to this going postal thing. Yeah. And one of them was not a mail carrier, and one of them was a mechanic, right, and another that was passed over for a promotion killed two people wounded two others. His name is Larry Jason, and this is the one who killed the woman who got his job. No, he was he went after the woman. Oh no, no, no, you're right. I'm sorry. I think he wounded her. I don't know if he killed her. Oh yeah, I wounded two people, Yeah, including supervisor and the woman. He killed two people and then wounded two others. And then the other guy was Mark Hillburn in California. He killed his mother and her home before going to the post office. And he's the one that was looking for a woman that he was stalking. She wasn't there, so he killed someone else, right, he was. That's actually kind of an atypical case that you could you could make a case doesn't necessarily qualify going postal because he wasn't disgruntled by being mistreated or whatever. Right, it was a stalking thing, which is bad enough. Workplace homicide involving stalking is horrible. Yeah, as far as going postal, look, it probably doesn't actually qualify. Yeah. And then two thousand six, it was a pretty interesting one. Um because mass shootings very rarely are at the hands of a woman. But Jennifer San Marcos in Goalita California, which is just outside Santa Barbara. Um, and this was in two thousand and six. She killed how many people here? Six? I believe she killed six coworkers, and notably, all six of them were people of color. Yeah, this is in two thousand six. She was a very disturbed individual, had put out a lot of signs to her employers, including having to be carted away literally in a male cart in handcuffs from the postal sorting facilities. She worked at UM and committed for seventy two hours again involuntarily. UM. And she came back years later and killed six people on a rampage. She was known to be extraordinarily racist and just about just like racist stuff and mentally ill to write to herself. Um. So yeah, she she basically raised a lot of red flags, and I guess they let her go and then she surprised everybody by coming back years later. Yeah. And side note, Um, she applied for her permit at one point in her life to publish a newspaper called The Racist Times, and I guess they were like na, Well, she applied for a business license to to to start a company to publish that. Yes, yeah, and I guess was rightfully denied. Yeah, I guess I don't know. Can you can you as a local government say like free speech? Yeah, I would think so, especially to local governments, but maybe she just didn't have especially in two thousand five. Yeah, who knows. Yeh. By the way, I'm gonna apply. One of my goals is to be a notary. Oh really, I heard Nick Thune became one. Oh really, Yeah, that's a very he said. Everything I read in two thousand and twenties, going to get a receipt sign means newspapers, magazines, receipts. So I guess he's gonna be he's gonna notarize everything. Yeah. I got something notarized the other day. And then I don't think you can notorize your own stuff or can. It seems unethical. Yeah. So it's not like I want to do it, because first of all, I don't need notaries that much. It's not like to save time. But I just thought, what an interesting, weird, kind of fun thing, you know, Chuck Bryant, podcaster, notary public. I think you should get that like wrapped around your minivan. Yeah, you know, I'd have to get a mini. Step one is getting a minivan. This is your list for get a minivan, become a notary, get a rap saying as much on your minivan. Have you seen that suv here on the parking deck, the Kim Brothers karate that's wrapped. That's great because the whole side of it is this guy getting a stomach kick and he's just like in silhouette photo. Now it's a full on photo. Very it was like the size of the whole backseat door and advertise and Kim Brothers kind of te it's very, very awesome. It worked for him. It's pretty good. The rap worked. They're like, that was well spent. And by the way, I wouldn't charge for my notary services either. That's the whole It's not like to make extra. It's not a side hustle, okay. But the thing is is like people don't value stuff that they get for free. My notary did it for free. She even came into work early to do it. And I was like what, oh, she said nothing. I went no seriously, and she said, I'm running for judge. She handed me a thing she said, just vote for me. Okay, So that's not freek Like, that's illegal, that's quid pro quo quid pro quo? Oh, you don't even know what that means? Just kidding, Yeah, it's Spanish. Right. Um. My daughter was watching she Frozen in Spanish the other day and I went to change it. She went, no, I want to leave it in Spanish. She said, s A P, s A P. And then she came out going. I was like, what are you doing? She said, I'm speaking Spanish? So what she speaking Spanish and you just didn't understand or was it gibberish? It was gibberish, But I said, you know who speaks Spanish, said Jerry's daughter. She went really, I said, yeah, And so is she gonna learn Spanish now to speak to Jerry's At some point? She's she's going to I don't know when, but I'm gonna get her going. You know what I want to do. I want to go on some like archaeological trip to the Middle East and then we'll overhear some scholars speaking Aramaic and you'll realize that that's what I was saying. After she watched Frozen two, just like in in uh in Um, what was this the movie? And not only is it Aramaic, but it's like the location of Jimmy Hoffa's body, or right now the Aramaic or like the Holy Grail, what was the the Exorcist? Oh sure, yeah yeah, or she'sn't maybe yeah, like some ancient tongue, should we take a break, had taken a break like seven minutes ago? All right, we're gonna take a break, and we're gonna go. Uh. It's actually a good spot because we're gonna talk about whether not there was something to going postal credit to this. Let's get serious again, because you would think that after these sort of a series of shootings over a period of about a decade, even though that final one was in two thousand six, it was a bit of an outlier that there would be big investigations into what's going on at the US Postal Service and did that happen? There was, but it was ill conceived. Yeah, let's talk about it. Okay. So by this time, when people are saying, like going postal it's a thing. Your postal carrier is gonna snap and shoot up your whole family or whatever, the Postal Service realizes it has a pr problem on its hands exactly. So they hire a warmer Secretary of Health and Human Services named Joseph California, Joseph Califano Jr. And he leads a commission. He chairs a commission to look into this going postal thing and to the great relief and four million dollars payment that of the Postal Service. You mean the U S taxpayer, right, yes, Um, Califano and his his UM group come back and say going postal is a myth. Yeah. And this was after a report by the General Accounting Office that did their own investigation and report. Uh. They actually issued six reports on poor labor management relations. That's just the g A oh alone. Yeah, the toxic work environment there. Um. And so the US Postal Service, via our money, like you said, threw down four million bucks to try and clean that report up, right, And and so the Califano report is what it's called. It was pretty clever, and it's in its goals and execution, Yeah, for sure. Basically said we're gonna look at the CDC stats about workplace deaths and workplace homicides in particular, and we're gonna just compare stuff statistically. And they did, and they found that not only is it not particularly dangerous to work at the post office, but that some other professions like, um, working as a convenience store clerk, that was the irony that I said to put a pin in. Or working as a taxi driver is far, far riskier as far as your chances of being killed in a homicide go a hundred and fifty times likely. Or if you're a taxi driver, then a postal worker eight times as much if you're a retail worker. And basically most of those are convenience store clerks, like killed during a robbery, yeah, exactly, or watch a postal postmaster get killed in your supply rooms. Right, either way, not a good day at work. I wonder which one that qualified for for the CDC because it was in a convenient but it was a postal service employee. I think it would be reflexive, meaning it would be could have to be at your workplace. I think it would qualify. Has having been a both maybe at that point I think the s he's like, fine, both, this is just too convoluted. Yeah. I picture like a meeting with a bunch of people sitting around smoking cigarettes, kind of debating this one, and then one guy just sticking a big bite of a club sandwich is saying, just throw it in both, right, They're like, this is after the new Gingrich Bob bar era, So we're not even allowed to use the word gun in the report. We have to just say homicide by bang bang bang bang. Um. So the California Fano report comes out, and again it's at the very least pretty convenient reading of statistics by the Postal Service. It is, and they basically said they had a press release, they held like all sorts of interviews, and they had California was respected, you know, like government servant. Public servant come out and say no, not only is this a bad rap for the post office going postals a myth? And to work at the post office, why you couldn't find a safer place to work in the United States. CDC statistics bear it out here. It is in black and white. And the press aid it up because the idea that America and American culture was wrong, that our intuition had gotten it wrong, and that actually it turns out that the whole thing is a myth. You and I would eat that up normally, but we get the even greater pleasure of saying that the Califano report was a myth and that that's where a lot of people's reporting stops even today if you look up going postal and the idea of working at the post office being dangerous, some reporting stops right there. That the Califano report proved that it was a myth, and it turns out that other people came along and said, this Califano report is way off, and here's the truth. Going Postals actually quite real. It's just that the Califano Commission went at it from the wrong direction. Well kind of purpose flee, yeah, not kind of purposely, very much purpose for four million dollars purposefully. Yeah. Notably the one man named Stephen uh Misasako. He's a I don't even know what accident that wasn't been off a couple of weeks. You can tell he is a thirty four year veteran, or was at the time of the USPS worked, it says here nearly every capacity. I think. He had a lot of jobs at the Postal Service, and he wrote a book called Beyond Going Postal, Chuck. We should also say that his one of those jobs is very important. He was a workplace improvement analyst, and one of the things that he was responsible for doing was figuring out what caused workplace violence at the post office. So he wasn't just like, you know, just some guy who had some ideas. Like this guy had learned firsthand what was really going at the post office, and he saw this Califano report as a whitewash. Yeah, I mean, he he said, And he used their own statistics, but he also used his own you know, personal experience u uh, anecdotal from his own point of view, and the research he did as that workplace improvement analyst, and he was like, you know, um, let's look at the stats. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, part of the CDC, said that of worker on worker homicides in the eighties were postal employees, even though they account for three quarters of one percent of the civilian workforce. So three quarters of a percent of the workforce is responsible for thirteen percent of the worker on worker workplace homicides. Yeah, and I think he was the I don't know about the first but one of the major voices that was saying, Okay, so you might get killed more often as a taxi driver, but not by another taxi driver, right, And the very definition of going postal, it's not Mary lou hinter walking in and shooting Judd Hirsch in the taxi bay. That would be going postal exactly, or going taxi. Sure, well, it's still be going postal. I guess it applied everywhere, but it means a worker on worker, usually homicide, almost always in the workplace, usually related to work. I can't believe that it took someone to write a book to point this out and why everyone was going to wait a minute, A convenience store employee getting robbed and killed is not the same as going in there and shooting up your office. Yeah, I know, it's kind of bizarre. I'll bet the alternative press was all over it. But it took this time to come along and write this book and be like, hey, hey, let me spell it out for you. So that was one thing was he just basically said, hey, like, yes, going postal is real, and here's the stats that prove it. Yeah, and here's why. Yeah, that was basically it's a pretty toxic environment. They did a certain the Califano report itself did a survey of twenty postal employees on their culture and compare that to national averages and other professions. And this is stuff, like I said, it's in the Califano Report. That said, uh, postal workers scored way way lower than the national average and all seven areas of positive attitude towards management, yeah, including it was a big sticking point, including like do you agree with the statement I am confident in the fairness and honesty of management? They're like, no, no, not really. Do you feel like you have autonomy at work? That was a big one. No, but everyone, not nobody. But they scored thirty nine favorable rating compared to the national average of seventy seven, so basically half as much. YEP said that they felt that they had autonomy or any kind of um ability to direct their own work or self. Yeah, and it's I wonder why, but it seems like the Postal Service, more than other jobs, had a culture and it seems like they've tried to correct it. But um so, I can't speak to like the current status, but when I worked there in the eighties, it seems like it had this weird culture of management being militaristic and talking down and dressing down employees in front of other employees. Yeah, so that was it, I mean, plain and simple, like, that was the style. It was a kind of I saw it described as a paramilitary style. And one of the big through lines that I think made a lot of postal workers and probably still do, but definitely did in the eighties and nineties feel helpless, powerless, and pushed to the brink was that they were um. They were subservient to their supervisors, who whose direct orders they had to follow. So imagine if imagine first, Jerry's our boss. Okay, step two. Imagine if if we said what we're gonna do an episode ongoing postal and Jerry said, I order you not to do that. I don't want you guys talking about that. You can't do it well. And you gotta add you're not doing two podcasts week now, you're gonna do eight, okay, And and in not listening to Jerry, we could just lose our jobs just for that. She could be like, well, that's it. You didn't listen, You're fired. That It was the culture, that was the structure, and I think still is at the post office. You had to follow a direct order from your supervisor, just like in the military. You had a choice. You either listened or you lost your job. That was a big one. Okay. So that's kind of like this mindset of how you are coming into work every day and you're getting this every day, multiple times a day from this person. How do you not start to kind of hate this person who keeps pushing you and pushing you. Yeah, and they were understaffed and overworked. That was a big one, working like sometimes up to eighty hours a week with Nixon had charged them with being profitable. Yeah, that's where a big turn happened. That's where neoliberalism comes in. Is this idea that um so Nixon signed the Postal Reorganization Act of nineteen seventy one and said, by three postal service needs to turn a profit. It's no longer going to be receiving texpayer funding. It needs to make its own money. And we're gonna open up competition from private industry, which is where FedEx and ups came from. So it went from being a pretty cushy government job where you know, you're you had a pension, and you know you were taking care of you at a union all this stuff, to all of a sudden, you're like pitted in competition with like private industry, and now like you can be fired at the drop of the hat um and you have no protections any longer. It happened overnight, and a lot of people point to this as the postal service being among the first industry in the United States economy that was neoliberalized, that where competition, deregulation, all this stuff happened as like a model at the postal service first, and then it started to spread into the rest of industry the rest of the economy to where now it's just commonplace, it's just capitalism. You don't even call it neo liberal liberalism anymore, and it's just normal to us. It's just you know, dog eat dog workplace where you know, if your employer tosses you a few cents for you know, your four oh one K, you're super grateful. That is not what it was like before. And the postal service was the first group to kind of undergo this transformation. And so some people say, well, they're the first ones who had workplace shootings, And if you follow it, the workplace shooting started to get more and more prevalent as more and more of the economy was liberalized, um so much so that in the eighties, workplace shootings tripled by the by the end of the decade, And they say, well, it was because of this neoliberal um revolution that came in and just upended that safety net to where if you didn't produce produced produce, you could be tossed out on the street and nobody be held accountable for that. Some people, some people don't handle that very well, and they can snap and come in and shoot up their workplace. And that's what some people, UM explain the going postal as right. And you combine that with UH incidents of mental illness and the gun culture in this country, and this is where we are. UM. Another thing that was going on at the post office was or the postal service, was that there was not much of a There was no way to if you had an issue, to really fix it. UM. Their grievance process was just ridiculous. UM. As of April two thousand and this is when the Californa report was released. UM, you would have to go to an art. You could file a grievance and go to an art and they would provide arbitration. But as of April two thousand, there were a hundred and twenty six thousand grievances awaiting arbitration, which was one grievance for every seven workers. One out of seven had it filed an official grievance. And that's not just like I'm unhappy and I'm complaining to my you know, spouse at home. There's an official filed grievance. And from what I understand, to file in official grievance was a big deal because the um your managers could retaliate against you with impunity and like harass you out of your job. Basically, yeah, well it's what we see now and for forever before this with filing aggrievance on like sexual harassment. It's like you're you're probably on the way out the door if that happened. I mean things are changing a little bit now, oh yeah, yeah, uh so since two thousand six, Um, this has really dropped off. Um, I think only for incidents since two thousand thirteen, and two of those or I'm sorry, three of the four we're at, uh like a FedEx or ups. But I guess going FedEx isn't really catchy. Going postal, going postal is and now you can go postal let your local going postal franchise where you can pick up your mail. It's amazing and relative security. It's so bizarre. It is what a weird world in country. It's what's weird to me is like you you want this to be wrapped up somehow and it's not. It's just kind of ongoing. But it's just turned into something else. Yeah, spread it's weird. Uh, well, if you want them, we're about going Postal. You can look that up on the internet see where you come up with um. And we are aware of the game Postal. I don't know if we mentioned it or not. We didn't. It's a video game, yea. How do you how do you get away with making a game like that? I think they really enjoyed the shock value of it. You think it got The second one got banned in New Zealand and Australia. I read interesting. Okay, uh, I think long ago. It's time for listener man, I'm gonna call this a safe cracking. We got. We got a lot of good uh remarks about safe cracking, including one guy that said we did the best job of explaining how locks work. And that's I was like, really, yeah, did you listen to the same episode that we've talked about. That was high praise. It wasn't praising. Hey, guys, just listen to the safe cracking. Great work I am co host of Heist podcast about the famous heist from history plug Plug. I thought you did a solid inform a piece on safe cracking. A couple of things here, Chuck was actually correct. Some safe crackers do use a seed line torches. For example, the mysterious expert Australian safe cracker known as Mr X. Wasn't that from Arrested Development? Oh? Was it? Mr? I watched a few of those the other night too, Such a great show. Uh. It used Mr X using a seed line torch to cut a two inch hole into the safe of Carrie Packer, at the time, the richest man in Australia, to steal five and a half million dollars in gold. Uh. Two fun facts about the history of safe cracking. The Little Joker was a tool used in the early nineteen hundreds. It's a tin wheel you could place behind the combination dial of a safe and when the bank manager would enter the combination to the vault each day, it would record the combination be a little notches on the tin required a robber to break into the bank twice though wants to plan it and wants to retrieve it. But the upside is you could pull out the little joker into the combination and walk right into the vault. But you double your exposure. Yeah, but that sounds like a pretty good way to do it if you're going with double your exposure. By the way, that's safe. I bought it, came and Emily was like, we really need a different kind of safe. Really. It's like really, She's like, yeah, so now I got this stupid heavy box that I'm not quite sure what to do with him. Maybe I'll try and sell him in craigslistter something. Do you remember the combo? Uh? I don't. I haven't said it and it took and it's it is a key mainly you're also you can sell it on craigs. Have some weirdos come over to your house and buy a safe. You can maybe notorize something for the mother. They make a podcast out of this. I think this is begging for it. And then another fun fact. Baron Max Shinburne was a bank robber and machinists who took a job at the Lily Safe Company, at the time, the biggest safe company in the US during the late eighteen hundreds. He worked there for a year. Not only did he learn everything about how the safes work. He also snuck little jokers into saves before they were shipped out. And then uh, when he quit, he and his crew traveled to the s and broke into all these safes he had put the back doors into. They broke into so many Lily Safes that some say Max and his crew were single handedly responsible for putting Lily Safe Company out of business. Wow, he said.
