Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Put us together, and you've got the podcast duo. That's huge in Dallas. Yeah, you've got a lot more than that. Yeah, that about four hundred pounds of hairy goodness, slippery hairy goodness. Yeah, four hundred pounds, and I'd say at least a hundred pounds of that his hair. Yeah right. I wish if I could get a haircut and would solve that problem in a shade. You did get a haircut. We have the same haircut. We're matching hair It's like, um, it's called the five guard. Yeah, four guard? You go, is there a five? Yeah? I want? I want, I go five, and I do a four and then do a three on the sides. Just feather it up. You know, it's weird this conversations. Yes, uh Umi says that she can smell a new haircut. You know how you can smell a freshly cut long? She says she can smell a new haircut, and I'm like, no one else on the planet. Can we even looked it up. There's no reference on the entire internets to smelling of a new haircut. Right, maybe she's a super taster smeller. I was going to say, I don't think that that translates to taste chuck. But is that a segue? I think that works kind of right? I mean, um, consider this. You know when you've ever smelled something and you're like, I know what that would taste like, but it wouldn't taste like that, But you just you can tell how something would taste for how you would imagine it would taste. The reason it's so easy to imagine that is that smell and taste are as similar as any two senses are because they're both reactions to chemicals. Right, olfactories smell gustatory. We'll probably say those words taste very nice. And the types of there, they're different types of molecules that react to different types of UM senses. Right, So you have an odorant that we smell that reacts with our our odor receptors, and then you have goostants or taste its. Yes, I prefer tasting um that react with the taste receptors on our tongue, right, right, But because they're so close, you know, you really actually can't have one without the other. Which if you've ever had, um, you know, any industrial accident associated with chlorine, you'll know that not only can you not smell any longer, you can't taste any longer. Yeah, or that's why the tastes weird when you have a cold. Like Patty and Selma, they had an accident. I can't remember what happened, but they everything tastes like cardboard to them. It was like this offhanded thing they said in the Simpsons, but like after it sunk in, I'm like, that's the most depressing thing I've ever heard. They were big smokers too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess that was my Patty and Selma. Uh, since you mentioned it, we should go ahead and point a little factoid here that worms and other invertebrates actually there's no distinction between taste and smell. Yeah. They're like, why why put any kind of division up. We're just gonna call all one thing. But my head looks like my butt, so what's the difference, right? They distinguished between volatile and non volatile organic compounds, right, which means that if you paint a room and put a worm in it, it knows that you just painted that room, right, or if you got your hair cut right perhaps, Yeah, uh so, I guess we should talk about these uh g r c s, gustatory receptor cells, taste buds. That's kind of where it all happens, it is, and you know, the taste buds are a little Oh, I guess they're part of the little bumps on your tongue. But yeah, it's actually under that. Yeah, well how that works. It's wrapped up in a package, right. Yeah. It looks like a little spring onion, like the butt of a spring onion, or radish looks like a radish it does, or beat It looks like one of those maybe even a weird gar like or you know what it looks like here looks like a hot air balloon. It looks like one of those boxing Yes, nice, chuck um. Within this little what's called papilla papilla Yeah, um, I don't think you're supposed to say it like that. Within that, there's fifty taste receptors and they're generally specialized taste receptors, right, and they're gonna be the same kind of taste receptor in every peppie, right, um. And so you've got fifty of those some basil cells which are skin cells. They produced skin cells, right, Yeah, not basil is in the plant. That would be great. If they had basil that lived in my tongue at all time, you would be turned one. Remember that's right. It's as for men, yes, just for men gel Um. Great if you're actually sponsored by things and we just worked them in like that. Yeah, it's called product place, right, what do we do on that? Um? So you have about fifty receptors in this little peppie lace and basil cells, and um, you have a little each each receptor cell has a little hair sticking out of it. Yeah, gustatory hair. Right. It's not Italian though now, but all of it does sound in town. That's from what I gather from this photo rendition, is that that is what you actually see poking up on your tongue. Right. The little round thing is actually the little goostatory hairs, isn't it. That's what it looks like. It's coming out of the top of the speed bag, and they come out of taste pores. And it's the goose story hair where all the actions taking place. Right, Yeah, that's where flavor and take well this or taste starts. Say you put a bite of steak in your mouth, right, so the the um, the saliva is breaking down the meat. It's the first step in breaking it down, and it's breaking it into these little molecules called tasteins or gustin, yes, depending on your preference and um. These molecules bind to the saliva, are taken across the tongue, and they stick to the receptors that are generally uh designed to if you believe in intelligent design, designed to um create the sensation that we call taste, or they just happened to match up. If you don't believe in intelligence, right exactly, good luck. And Chucker's taste is much different from flavor, isn't it. Let's define taste and flavor because this is a big This is a big thing. Yeah, flavor. I think Sarah Dowdy actually have stuff you missed in history class. Fine podcasts. She wrote this and the way she put it, which I thought was great, was flavor is it's sort of like a full body. And we'll get into actually that stuff later with the gut cells. But flavor is a whole body experience. It's um, all your senses, including smell, obviously tactile, and she said that with spicy food, pain is factored in. Is one of the aspects of flavor. Yeah, I love that. So taste is this this taste in molecule wrapped up in your saliva, smacking against augustatory hair. Yeah, it's it sends a transmission to your brain, right, and your brain encodes it and says mommy right. Or salty. There's different voices for each taste, as I'm sure you know already. Um, don't ask me to do sour, but that's just the we will later. That's just the taste. The flavor is that the pressure that the steak puts on your tongue, um, the the the TecTile sensation of you know, the kind of ends of the meat. You know what I'm saying, it's just kind of dancing across your tongue or if you like your steak rare, medium rare, like I do that, just that lump of like warmish, bloody flesh, right, yeah, And then like you said, pain to all of our vegetarian fans, just turned off. Just are so disgusted right now. But that whole sensation is flavoring. All these different sensations are going to the brain, and the brains like steak. Yeah, you know what I want to know. And actually just thought of this. What is the deal when you like, eat a piece of cheese. Someone will tell me that, I'm sure like you get a piece of sharp cheddar and it feels like your jaw locks up. Do you ever have that with certain flavors? No, really, your jaw lot, I know, with like really dill sour flavor. I'm like, no, I'm talking about Jerry, have you ever had that cheese? Jerry's asleep, Like, I'll put a piece of cheddar in my mouth and my my jaw just like clinches, like noticeably clinches. I have no idea what you're talking about. Jerry just said, yes, Jerry doesn't know what we're talking about at all. Well that maybe you know. We're gonna talk about super tasters in a minute. There are different types of tasters. We found out it's not the same for everyone, So maybe that's one of my you know, my kinds, right, And here's a little spoiler about super tasters. The key to supertasters. They have more taste buds. It's huge boring alright, so chuck, um, there are, of course, what every school kid knows, our primary tastes, right, yeah, sweet, salty, sour, bitter. Right back in our day, that was it. That's all the taste you'd get, right, sunny, yeah, and um what was it? Salt, sweet, sour, bitter? Yeah, right, and then um, what's funny? In the Western world, For a good century after a fifth taste was discovered, we still stuck to these four and didn't recognize that there was a fifth one Americans because the researcher was Japanese and his work was never translated to English. So in about nineteen d nineteen o one, um a Japanese researcher named kikun Ikeda Yeah, thank you aka Akita Akeda. Yeah. In the early nineteen hundreds he discovered um something called umami, which means a delicious savory taste in Japanese, right right. What he was doing was he was he was cooking some of that Japanese seaweed that we both love, and he was like, you know what, this is neither sweet, salty, bitter or so or so he started researching it, and he found out that he isolated the glutamic acid and found out that it had his own good statory receptor. So he was like, this is legit, and he said it in Japanese is the problem, right, yeah, And everybody was like, what that guy just say, mommy, let's go back to the World's Fair in St. Louis right, that's my scream. Um. So one of the reasons also that it was never really investigated over here is ou mommy is much more of a flavor that is in Japanese dishes, like you said, seaweed huge, but also over here we have tomatoes and new mommy flavor meat meat savory, sure, right um. And uh Kada's research was backed up in the West in nineteen five later, yeah, when some researchers started to try to isolate the taste for monosodium glutamate. And remember oummi is uh glutamic acid, right, yes, so glutamate glutamic acid. So they're trying to isolate the flavor of MSG, which is a pretty distinct savory flavor, and they found that no combination of the primary taste bitter sweet, salty sour could replicate MSG. I wonder how they did that. I don't know. There's a lot going on in flavor science that it is fascinating huge, yes, but it's yeah, I'm curious, but they basically yeah, you're right, they came away with nothing. All the combinations. They can't account for MSG and it's magical properties a flavor and calories and uh, it's supposed to like make you feel full or something, you know what they say. I don't know with MSG. Yeah, I thought that was the deal with or maybe that was just an urban legend people like, you know, Chinese food. MSG makes you feel awful. No, it makes you feel sick. It's called Chinese restaurant syndrome. That's Chinese restaurant syndrome. I know with me if I eat MSG, Um, it's uh it feels like a clause grabbing the top of my stomach hurt so bad. Um, yeah, it's it's a lot of people are allergic to MSG. And of course Chinese restaurants were famous for they I don't think so, and most most restaurants actually advertised whether or not use it. Well, they advertise that they don't use that. They don't advertise like with MSG is a bad thing. Sure, but remember we got a listener mail in once from somebody whose family owned a bunch of Chinese restaurants and was like, you guys talk about Chinese restaurants center and because MSG is found in like snack chips or you know, and we get all the blame right, and it's just it's not just Chinese restaurants, and a lot of Chinese restaurants have stopped using MSG. So there you go, listener. We satisfied that two year old listener mail just we finally get around to it. And did you hear what a pro I was. I didn't cite the snack chip that he used as an example. That's how good we're getting. Wow. Yeah, my mind is blown right now too. So UM, like you said in two thousand two, actually is when Akita's study was finally translated into English. So many years even after oh so from that point New Mommi um was accepted as an as the official fifth taste and then but think about it, so that's like a century because the taste map, which we'll talk about the tongue map, that was established in nineteen one about the time that Kata was coming up with the umami. But it was this that sweet, sour, salty, bitter right. Um, So for a century the taste map didn't change, and then in two thousand two, U mom is accepted in the West finally, right, and then it seems like the floodgates open, right all of a sudden, like they're like, well, wait a minute, if there's a fifth taste, maybe we haven't been paying enough attention. Like fat is apparently now the sixth primary taste, right, leave it to the French. Um. There are new studies now Joshure's that says that, well, they they think they've identified fat as its own thing, like humans have a taste for fat, and that the funny thing I thought, if you have a high sensitivity to that taste, you eat less fatty foods. You know, chuck. That is I think, Um, really, that's something that's going to become what gets taste research. It's funding is obesity and diabetes and stuff, because what they found is people who are when you're talking about super tasters, supertasters who taste sweet things, tend to eat less um tasters who a lot of people don't really detect the fat as much people who do have less body fat. You said, the lower body mass index. Yeah. Um, so you don't eat the foods that you taste the most. Yeah, that's interesting, it's very interesting. Yeah, they did. The lady did the one study on supertasters, and I think she found that women in their forties at least, I guess that was her set was they were uh, they gained less weight or they were you know, slimmer, right than non supertasters. But she didn't because they were eating less of it. Yeah, but she didn't find it in men, which I thought was odd. I guess men are just like we just shovel whatever. Bring it on. Yeah, it's like, oh, you want me to lose some weight, watch, I'll just drink water for a day and there's fit you pounds should right, So chuck now it's two and if you stick out your tongue, please stick out your tongue. Chuck. You know I bit my tongue almost all the way off when I was a kid. Oh I see that. Wow, it's like Frankenstein's tongue. So all right, chuck, stick out your tongue please. Still. Yeah. Um, so we've got you, mommy. We've got sweet, sour, bitter, salty, fatty yeah yeah, and uh, a lot of it looks like the that's a pretty fat tongue, chuck, it's not thick. This is worse than the beat poop. I like the beat boop um. And we also have what they've recently discovered that we actually have specialized receptor cells that detect carbon dioxide. Yeah, well, should we finish the tongue map real quick at least? And why it's bunk? Sure? Uh, because you were pointing, but people can't see you point, Josh. So the classic tongue map says that bitters in the back, sour was on the side, salty is on the front edge, sweet is on the tip, and umami they're throwing on the posterior and saying that that's where that is. Yeah, they're like that that real estates open. That's but they're fine. They've they've also found that um that there's fat somewhere has to go in there somewhere, right, Yeah, do they know where that is yet? I still knew. Yeah, it's too new from what I understand, right, but I think it's it's not just it's I think it's going to take the the the tongue map away. That's going to be done away with because there are primary tastes, certainly, but they're finding that, you know, the whole tongue map when it was invented in nineteen o one, Yeah, a German researcher. Basically what he did was to say areas of low sensitivity were depicted like there was no sensitivity, like there's those lines that like there's actual borders. And yes, maybe this area of the tongue is higher in recept yourselves for umami or sweet or bitter, but that doesn't mean that it's not found elsewhere on the tongue as well, and so a lot of tastes are a mixture of all these. Number one, well sure, and all he did was interview people, which I thought was odd. Yeah, his research was backed up in nineteen seventy four by Virginia Callings, Right, well, sort of backed up and sort of not well, it was kind of like revised. I guess it's like, yes, his he was right and saying like this area is highing sweet receptors than this area, So you could conceivably put a tongue map, but maybe it was just kind of pushed the wrong way and that um and overlap. Yeah, Callings was the one who was saying like, this is a lot there's a lot of interplay going on, including CEO two. Let's get back. Can we talk about now is the time? That's pretty cool. I mean you sent me this over the emails a couple of days ago and said, dude, you you tapped me on the head and said, dude, you know that bubbly stuff. You think that's that's what's making that taste in your mouth? And it's not. No. Actually, there we have a gene that UM expresses an zyme that's meant to detect carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, right, so we can break it down into useful forms UM, and they've for forever. Basically we thought that anytime we drank a carbonated drink, it was a popping in the little bubbles on our tongue that created that sensation. Not so fast. They put people in a pressurized chamber, hyperbaric chamber, right, given them soda that yeah, has no bubbles present, and people could still detect the carbon dioxide taste. So there's yet another taste. There's no place on the tongue man for carbon dioxide, and yet there's specialized receptor cells for detecting it. Right, yeah, Well, because they like everything else, they said, this is interesting. Let's get some mice and genetically uh make them different and weird and test them out. And they did that and they found it was the same receptor as sour. Right, yes, what they um the sour receptor basically doubles as uh CO two detector as well. They removed that in mice. Yeah, um. And also they put a sensor into one of their nerves, which is pretty interesting in and of itself that we can do that. So those those combinations, those series of studies um led to this discovery that we have uh c O two detectors. And what an important discovery that that is? Right, and Chuck, it is is it? I think? So what does it mean? Well, that's the whole thing. It leads you to the question, Chuck, why do we have taste? Anyway? There's one obvious answer is that, um, we are we learned to eat by deriving pleasure from it, and we associate some taste with their pleasurable right. Well yeah, but early man, it was a lot of times like warning systems. Well this is the less obvious answer, right yeah, Like if they ate something sweet, they're like appealed to them. It's you know, it gives them a lot of calories, and so that's a good thing. If they tasted something really bitter, it might be poisonous, so you should spit that out right. Sour could be spoiled something more. It could be you know, a sweet and sour candy, which is yummy, right, right. And and with early man we had yet to figure out a way to encode ideas and warnings about like not to eat something to you know, the written word um, So we had to use our taste senses on our own. And we still That's what's so cool. That's why I love evolution all these years later. That's why we're still attracted to sweet things because that was survival. It gave you calories to live, basically food energy. Right. But we have also gotten to the point where we are, you could say, a reasonably fat society here in the US. And you mix that together with health consciousness or self consciousness especially, and all of a sudden you have artificial sweeteners, which you would think is good for your body. But they found that there's a correlation between U seeing um, artificial sweeteners and type two diabetes, right, And they figured out through this investigation, they figured out that there are tastes cells elsewhere in the body. It's not just the tongue. And we're getting this idea that not only our tastes, um, they're more primary tastes than we realized. Tastes are interplace of of different um receptor cells, and there's taste cells elsewhere in the body, in the guts specifically, but also probably in the pancreas, in um, the liver, in other areas. So these tasting these molecules that are bounds alive and they enter the gut, they start sending out other signals rather than meady right, like what we were saying that the like a bitter taste might be something poisonous. Sometimes you'll eat something poisonous and it gets past the old tongue and you swallow it, and that's when the guts taste cells kick in, and that's why you might like it might spur vomiting. It triggers your vomiting reaction. Thank god. Yeah. UM, that's one way with the type two diabetes. Uh. With the sweet receptors in the gut are signaled by something sweet, they tell the blood to start absorbing insulin. Right, they start, they tell the surrounding cells to start absorbing insulin. Glue coast, I'm sorry, burn for energy, So insulin which actually chuck you. Remember we've talked about before, and I think whenever we talked about longevity, insulins like the worst thing for your body. But we use it to go into cells, to basically open the cells, so gluecoast can go be burned, um and you. But if the glue coast doesn't arrive, if there's no sugar eaten and it's just an artificial sweetener, that signal is still triggered. The insulince still goes and jams open your cells, but nothing gets burned, and the insulin levels go up, and you have type two diabetes. So that's the tie between drinking like a diet soda, right and leading potentially leading to diabetes. Right. But isn't that interesting that we figured out something new about taste That it's all over, it's in all over sensation is what they're coming up with, Right, that's crazy. So what else do we have, Chuckers, Well, I think we finally need to just um map out the supertaste or thing just a little bit more, right, because supertasters are pretty cool and how it all happened is really cool. Shall I tell the story? I'd like to hear this story. Way back in the nineteen thirties, a scientist name Arthur Fox from DuPont was pouring some and this is like every like, osha, this is the worst nightmare when they hear stories about this laboratory stories like this. This dude was pouring some PTC. Do you want to say the long name? I do, but I have to find it first. I'm not prepared to say it. It is fennel theo carbon minde. Yeah, very nice, thank you. So he was pouring some of this PTC it's an organic uh compound, into a beaker and the way he described it was he said it suddenly became a cloud that started shooting all over the room and this is when Ocean's like, oh god, and uh. It basically filled up this room. And he was in there with his partner and his buddy was like, a ah ah, it's awful, it's so better. And he was like, what are you talking about? Wow, that's not bitter. What what do you mean? And then you know that triggered the conversation. Wait a minute, what's going on here? You had a really awful reaction. And apparently I've seen studies on YouTube this they don't use PTC anymore dangerous, but uh, apparently it's so bitter, it's like the reactions are hysterical. So he goes home and he starts putting this stuff on his family's tongues and his friends tongues to see if they react the same way. And he found that there's no rhyme or reason who it happens to, because it's a genetic trait. And they said, it's what they used to use this for. It's so specific of a genetic trait. They used to use it for paternity cases like up through like the nineteen seventies. Yeah, it's as they said, it's the most like, uh, one of the most common mentally and traits right up there with like eye color and blood type. Is whether or not PTC makes you like freak out with bitter really, Yeah, that's a terrible test. Yeah. So, and it's it's a specific gene. There's a dominant allele for the T A S two R to eight gene. Right, they've they've isolated that. Yes, seventy percent of people this is what's weird. Se can gets the bitter taste. Fifty eight percent of Australians and of Native Americans in both North and South America, almost all of them have that reaction. Really Yeah, that crazy. Yeah, I don't even know what it means. I just thought it was interesting. So the in UM there was a researcher from Yale who coined the term super tasters. Right, yes, and it's not just bitter and it's not just people who react to um PTC or PCP. All right, everyone reacts to PC. Yeah, but whether or not you get you beat up ten cops I think is probably that's a praternity test to let's see how you react to PCP. Right, Uh, it's not just this bitter taste, right, you can have a supertaster who really tastes sweet things, really tastes you mommy. Really it's a primary taste, right, Yeah, that's just heightened And like we said, the spoiler is you just generally have more of these pepiles. Yeah, you have more taste buds of the type than other people. Yeah, and it can be a good thing, like to have a heightened sense can be good in certain respects, but it also apparently, UM like coffee and Brussels sprouts and really sweet and spicy things. Super tasters can't handle that a lot of times. So it's a curse as well as a blessing. Yeah, I would say I can't handle broccoli, but it has nothing to do with taste, you know, I like all that. I've been eating beats like crazy lately, ever since I beat salad. Yeah, I've been making my own beat salad. I've been grilling beats, a little balsam, a little olive oil, not hand that I'll have to try it, put it on the grill, and then the next day you're gonna think you need to go to the doctor. But it's just the beats, that's all I'll say. So that's pretty much it. Like we said, UM, if you're a super taster. Also, it supports that um that aversion to foods that you can taste more than other people. Super tasters who um are are sensitive to sweet ten to eat less sweets, etcetera. But they also avoid leafy greens, which is not good. No, you gotta have that. Yeah, you pregnant. Actually, we forgot to mention they don't use PTC anymore, but they do use p R O P as the test now, which is a it's a synthetic compound. They just call it prop, right, and they use it in um thyroid medicine. Right. Yeah, but now that's that's the standard supertaster test to see if you have that better reaction to that. So they just give you thyroid medicine or they drop some prop on your tongue. I don't know how it works. Weird. Uh. And then lastly, chuck the answer to why a lot of stuff tastes like chicken. I don't know. This surprised me. They have UM, well, at least that cornell. Using gas chromatography, they have isolated a thousand UM concentrations chemical concentrations in n chicken that that contain tastings that the human tongue can taste or that the human brain can sensus taste. And they used to think it was hundreds of thousands. They're like, no, it's just thousands, and chicken is like, well, I made up the chicken part. That's my theory. And my theory is that it's because there's only a thousand instead of a hundred thousand. There's your answer right there. And then lastly check that also makes me wonder if there's a thousand chemicals and they used to think it was hundreds of thousands. So there's hundreds of thousands of chemicals out there, but we can only taste a thousand. It's kind of like light, you know, we can only see within a certain band of light. Makes you wonder how things that we can't taste taste. You just chew on that one. And if you want to know more about taste, go to how stuff works dot com where you can type the word taste in the handy search bar. Uh. And also, uh, this is I think requisite listening for a molecular gastronomy podcasts that will do some time in the future, don't you think? All right, let's love to do one on that. Alright chuck. Then you know what time it is, right listener? Mail? Or are we doing some sort of uh Facebook or anything? Oh wait, we got our big, big announcement. Yeah that's right, thank you for reminding us. Go ahead, all Atlanta event right, Yeah, we're gonna do an Atlanta thing similar to what we did in New York. Yes, because we got called out by all the Atlanta folks like you go to New York in New York, New York. What about Atlanta. Yeah, well we're like, yeah, we kind of have to. So yeah, we're gonna do trivia night, right, all comers can come take us on. We'll figure out the details. But um, we're looking for venue still. Yeah, we could use you people for details. If you were in Atlanta and you have some connections with what might be a good venue to host our trivia, please get in touch with us. Yeah, so yeah, we'll keep you posted. If you have any suggestions, comments, whatever about the Atlanta thing, email us. And now wait, well, should be sometime in August we should point out. Okay, we don't. We don't have a lockdown yet, but look forward in the next like six weeks. Now listen to me. All right, all right, Josh, I'm gonna call this rare shout outs because we don't do these very often. Shouts out, shouts out, shouts out like the new Williams Sapphire. Hi, Josh and Chuck. My husband and I are huge fans of your podcast. We eagerly wait every Tuesday and Thursday so we can hear what you have to say. I guess that proves your fans. Yeah, uh, now you can be my Heroes as well. Next Saturday, July is my husband's twenty four b day. Chuck, this is very kind of you, and I don't know. We don't do this very often. We just bought our first house. He made me promise not to buy him anything. I guess because they just spend on their money in the house. I wonder if you give him a shout. I know you don't do this often, so let me tell you why he's cool enough to get a one of a kind birthday greeting. His name is DJ Vile.
