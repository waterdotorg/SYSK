Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from house stuff works dot com? Welcome to the house Stuff Works Podcast. I'm editor Candice Gibson, joined today by my trustee staff writer Josh Clark. Josh are you today great? Candice? How are you? I'm well? Well, that sounds like it can only mean one thing. Today's topic of choice? Is swearing at work a good thing? Josh? You seem to be a pretty gunghir advocate of this. Why is that? Candice? You remember my where your Hawaiian Shirt to Work? Campaign? Um? The whole thing was just a drive to get everybody loosen up and get to know each other. Well, it didn't take as well as I had hoped, So now I'm starting a swear at work campaign? Oh you can? I know exactly where this came from. This article you're it called is swearing at Work a good thing? Yeah? Yeah? And this is based on an actual study. We're not just like tossing own words for fun here. This came out of Great Britain, the University of East Anglia, where essentially some researchers looked at what happened to people who swore in the workplace? Yeah, they hung around a mail order warehouse. Yeah, and they were looking to see if swearing at work alienated coworkers or if it actually brought them closer together with you know, all the salty language and people really showing their true colors. Sure, sure, I could see a lot of cheeky Brits running around the mail order warehouse just cursed in up the storm. You know. It had to have been a really fun study to do, I imagine. Well, I think so. And it was pretty successful too, because the hypothesis was correct. It really did establish better relationships among employees because they could feel like they were really expressing themselves and really communicating with everyone in an authentic way. Sure, it's a it's pretty much basic social bonding theory. The more you share of yourself, the more you can establish social bonds like trust. I mean, how can you truly trust a co worker if they've never heard you swear? I mean, think about how much closer you and I are thanks to the word son of you know that kind of thing. I know I say this every time you turned an article to me. But it's interesting, especially about this study is that the mail room workers, like you were referring to these sort of lower level employees. Yeah, they really let it rip all the time. But when they examined how the executives behaved and spoke to each other, no one really cussed that much. It was a little bit more reserved and refined. Right. Well, the studies authors were saying that they hope that while management might not swear, uh, they they want to see hr directors maybe look the other way or even encourage it because it does develop social bonds. But you know, the East Anglia study really didn't, you know, put the whole thing to rest. This is a pretty whether or not we should allow swearing in our culture, whether it be on work or television or radio, is a pretty big ongoing battle. It really is. And I now, for instance, I was looking at the FCC and some of the rules that they have about swearing and the idea of a fleeting expletive, which is essentially when you just say like hot pie and it's not really in context with anything relating to sexual content or bathroom humor. Sometimes the sec will lett networks get away with it. But when you're talking about and there's a toilet in the same sentence. That's not gonna fly. No, I agree. Um. And the FCC is actually as strict as you might think their standards are. They're not strict enough for some people. Have you heard of the Parents Television Council? Yes? Some more? Okay, Well they actually you may be upset about this. They went after the producers of one of your favorite shows, Gossip Girl, because they had a they who are you really getting the hang of this swearing it or campaign? Well, you know that I've had to take off my Hawaiian sure in mine as well. Yes, I appreciate that too. Um. So they go after Gossip Girl for this kind of steamy ad promo campaign that they came up with, and they all so didn't like. Um thirty rocks milf Island episode. Did you see that one? It was a good one, but the Parents Television Council didn't like it. Actually, these people are pretty scientific. They've released studies of how much of an increase in profanity there's been on television over a set number of years. So for instance, and this is during the Family Hour, which is eight to nine pm, Um, there is a increase from two thousand one to two thousand six in in Profanity Right, they found eight hundred and fifteen foul wards in a hundred and eighty hours of programming, which is four point five three swears an hour. The most amazing thing is that somebody actually sat there and watched a hundred and eighty hours of television programming counted everyone of the swears. Well, clearly I'm in the wrong business.
