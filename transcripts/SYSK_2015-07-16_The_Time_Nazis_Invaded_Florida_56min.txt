Josh: Welcome to you Stuff you should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, Jerry's over there. This is stuff you should know. So huge thanks right off the bat to everyone who came out for our Northeast plus one summer tour. Yes it was a pretty big success. Yeah, big thanks Boston and New York in Philadelphia and Durham in Washington, d c uh and look for us this fall, like early October in the Midwest, the Upper Midwest. Don't get excited yet. St. Louis not yet. But hopefully we're targeting Detroit, because boy, we're long overdue for Detroit. Yeah. I don't know how we're going to be received in Detroit. You're gonna love us, I hope. So I think we're looking at your cargo Detroit, maybe Cleveland, Minneapolisoliswaukee, in Milwaukee or Madison, We're not quite sure yet, so um maybe some advice wisconsinites. Yeah, and then everyone in each city will just say come here because I don't feel like driving a few hours. Uh So yeah, thanks for the support and look for us this fall. And did you thank squarespace. Yeah, did you think how stuff works? Yeah? Did you thank Jerry for the moral support? Sure? I think Jerry every day. It's part of my wake up routine. Yeah, I'm looking forward to going back on tour. It's fun. It is Okay, you read for this, I'm ready. We're gonna channel our stuff you missed in history class. Yeah. I'm not sure if they've done this or not. Have you are you? I don't know? So, um, Chuck, I don't know if you know this one because it didn't come up in this article. But back in World War Two, did you know that the Japanese actually carried out main campaigns, two of them in Oregon? I didn't know that, Oh you did. I'm a bit of a buff and then insane. Yeah. I mean there's a lot of forgotten history or little known history that you read it in. Uh. Thank god for like the Internet, because someone will post an article and say, I bet you never knew this, and then you're like what, Yeah, that's pretty much the function of the internet that what you just describe, you know, So this one, I think I've learned about this from unsurprisingly Uncle John's bathroom reader years and years and years ago. But definitely not in this kind of detail. It turns out. Then in World War Two, in I believe in Armagansett, New York, which is on Long Island, and ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, which is just south of Jacksonville. UM, Nazi saboteurs landed. They invaded America. Pretty remarkable, it really is. What's even remarkable is how badly their operations went. Yeah, what's remarkable is well, not remarkable, what's uh. Thankfully they chose a bunch of dopes, um, half hearted dope, half hearted dopes who I don't know if they didn't do their research. We'll get into how they picked these these shmos. But it didn't go so well. But if they had to pick them like the right guys, it might have been a whole different story. Oh yeah, totally in this war and and the FBI, especially Jager Hoover, really lucked out that these guys were half hearted dope. Well not if you ask him. No, it was just you might as well have worn a cape around the office, you know, well he may have. And little else. So um, back in World War two, even before World War tour, before the US centered the Second World War Hitler had this great fantasy of sending New York City up in flames, Like he really wanted to just destroy New York and Verna von Broun, the guy who helped get America to the Moon, was working on a rocket program that could strike uh, the United States from Europe. That was one thing never fully realized, um, because the war came to an end before they could develop the right kind of missile. But they were working on it, and they were also working on long range bombers. They could fly out of Europe all the way to america'ss coast and bomb. Apparently hit they used to literally sit around and watch like film footage of cities burning and like fantasizes about New York City. Crazy. Yeah, well he was pretty crazy, um. But he finally realized that, like, if he was going to get New York, the best, most efficient, most at hand way to do that was to send saboteurs into the United States to infiltrate and do New York themselves. That's right, you know, terrorists essentially. Well, yeah, the only thing that kept him from being considered full fledged just straight up terrorists is because we were formally at war with this country. So they were they were considered officially spies and unofficially saboteurs. Yes, Uh should we shout out the articles here? Yes, let's right off the bat. I read, well, I read a few. I read one on uh damned interesting, which was good. Uh. There was one you sent called world War two German saboteurs invade America in nineteen two. Yeah, that was on history Net. History Net, and I feel like there was one more. There was a Spiegel article. Oh yeah, that's one o UM called Operation past Storious Hitler's unfulfilled dream of the New York in flames poor. I know his dreams failed. So, uh, World War two hadn't been raging for long for the U S when this happened. It was right after uh Paul Harbor was bombed, and Hitler said, you know what, they think they're over there, They're a long way from us, so they probably feel pretty pretty safe. So let me undermine that and let me devise this plan um. And it was originally going to be a wave of saboteurs like every you know, four to six weeks. They were going to be sending in small teams of of terrorist slash spies to wreak havoc on the US, and uh, thankfully it didn't work out that way, so it was kind of scrapped. Yeah, the the obver I think that's how you pronounce that you're the one who knows German, Is that right? Yeah? So that was the the basically the sabotage unit of the German Military Intelligence Corps. And these guys had kind of perfected their craft with explosives and terrorism and and um all that jazz in your Pean theaters already in the war. And so they set up a school, a terrorist school, which supposedly these guys were trained in like jiu jitsu as well as explosives and stuff like that. And I'll bet it looked a lot like um, enter the Dragon in there, but with Germans, you know. Yeah. I wonder if they were training kung fu school on an island somewhere, but this is in the woods. I wonder if they in the Black forest perhaps. I wonder if they were trained in pe knuckle and movie watching and car buying I think that, and rolling over and singing like a canary. So the the app there um selected a man. His name was Walter Capp Or is that Cappy Walter cop what Walter Capp, who was a pudgy, bull necked man as described in the history article, and the reason that they selected him to head up this operation, which Cap came to um nickname is Operation Pastorious, which was named after Francis Daniel past Story is one of the early German immigrants to the United States who arrived in Philadelphia in three The reason they selected Cap for this operation was because he had lived in America for twelve years already, so he was he was he understood America, how it functioned, what targets should be struck, that kind of stuff. And they said, select your teams, and so he put a donkey on the wall and got a tale with a little pin on it. Right now. What he did was he did some research and he went through the records of something called the Austlin Institute, and they were big on getting Germans back to Germany ones that had emigrated to the United States workout, yeah, okay, So specifically the ones who were looking he was looking for ones who had been in the United States in this case, and a lot of these people have been in what was called the Boon or is it the bund uh I would say it's a booned, the American booned, which was like the basically the Nazi sympathizers in the United States, and they would set up little shops all over the country. Yeah, and they would speak out against UM Franklin Roosevelt or UM speak in favor of fascism. And apparently they managed to get twenty thousand people at a rally at Madison Square Garden once by holding a Knicks game. Pretty much. I don't think the Knicks could even get twenty people would come out to Madison Square. Um, but they were so unpredictable and radical here in the United States that even the Nazi Party officially distanced itself from these guys officially. Unofficially they recruited from their ranks specifically for Operation Pastorious. Yeah. So what he uh? He found some some blue collar dudes, um. All but two of them had been Nazi Party members, which was a good start. Ford dropped off right off the bat, and that left him with what would be U eight dudes, which they divided up into two teams of four, one leader on each side and three dopes below them, with with cap at the head of the whole thing. Yeah. Even though he didn't come over to the United States for the operation. He was just sort of running the training initially. Yeah, and he was watching him do jiu jitsu. I guess so you're in the hilarious Germans. I don't think so. It just seems a little like, you know, neighborhood ninja camp kind of stuff. You know. Well, they had to train in some sort of hand to hand combat. No, they're saboteurs. They're not. They don't need to know that they're not. They're supposed to know how to blow up a bridge. Yeah, but what if they it caught in the middle. I gotta like turn and run away jiu jitsu somebody down. Now, you just run if you're a saboteur. Well, that's some foreshadow right there. So I hear the players on on one on Team one, we'll call it Team um Nights. How about that? That one? Sure? On Team Minds, you had the leader George John Dosh and he was thirty nine. He was the oldest guy and uh thirty nine, and he was picked because he was um. He was a smooth talker, and he was apparently just seemed very American, which was you're gonna stick some Germans over there to to be saboteurs. It's probably good if they can pass themselves off as just regular good German Americans. Right. Plus also you have the added benefit of not having to teach them to speak colloquial English. Sure. Um, and they already know the terrain, they know the culture. Where's Coney Island? Vant the hotdog exactly? Yeah, so they were all good, right. Yeah, was that count Dracula? Uh No, that was that was my German saboteur. So that's why they went with the guys who had already spent time in America. Plus they it also showed, um, a pretty significant loyalty to your homeland, the fatherland in this case, where when war breaks out, you go back to where the war is being fought supported. Yeah, you know what I mean. So they're like selecting from the Ostlands Institute roles of emigrants who were also boond members. It seemed like a just to knock it out of the park group of guys. Yeah, so um, uh josh, he was. He actually did, like he said, served in the German Army in World War One, came to America, worked as a waiter, and then in nineteen thirty nine said, you know what duty calls, I'm going back home. Um. The second guy on the first team, Ernest Peter Berger. He was supposedly a smart guy, and he had an interesting story because he was he had long been a Nazi, since they said, as you know, as long as Hitler himself had been a Nazi. Yeah, he was part of the beer hall push. Yeah, he was what you call a what's the early adopter. He was Nazis, he really was. And he he actually had fled Germany for the United States because he was afraid he was going to get brought up on brawling charges. That's right. He like to fight. Yeah, And he stayed there for about six years and then worked as a machinist in the Midwest, even joined the National Guard, the U. S National Guard, and um became an American citizen yep. And then he went back after Hitler game power, right, Well, he went back mainly because of the Great Depression, because the right yeah, but I mean it coincided. But he was like, yeah, this place stinks now yeah, and Hitler's in power, I'm gonna go become a brown shirt and rough up people on the street, which is what he did. Pretty much because he really did love to fight. And um, the brown Shirts were purged in the Night of the Long Knives by Hitler and his cronies and um Burger was it was Burger right? Yeah. He he managed to not be killed during that purge. Yeah, so he was working with his buddy um Ernst Room of the Stormtroopers like serious business, right, Rome was actually killed during the perch Oh yeah, they put apparently they put a pistol in his cell with him and gave him ten minutes to kill himself. And he said, if if you want me dead, Adolph's gonna have to do it himself. And they came back and he was staying there right, and Hitler is like, what is going on here? Um, and the guy was standing there with the shirt off, with his chest bear to him. Yeah, supposedly, and they just shot him in the chess point blank and the head of the Brown Shirts went down. So that didn't work out for him, No, but Burger did survive this, Yeah, he did survive and went off to college. But then he wrote a a paper about the Gestapo that was not too favorable and he got sent to a concentration camp for his efforts for seventeen months, right, and then when he was released, they said you can come out, but you have to go off with the army. Yeah, they harassed his wife. It was I don't know that he was the best pick, right, think we've antagonized, thrown in prison and then forced into the army. We also killed his boss, harassed his wife. Will trust him as a savage as a team of one of eight, So Burger is the right hand man to Dash's team on Team Team mites E I n Z E I n Z. And then there were other There were two other dudes, Heinrich Henk, right, it's a great name, and Richard queerin Yes, And they were a couple of machinists who, um, we're a couple of machinists. They've been in America for a while back, and we're selected for this team. Yeah. Basically they went back to Germany started working at Volkswagen and um, you know, I guess we're probably eager to leap on h top secret job like this. It's probably appealing to these guys, you know. So that was Team Ice. We'll talk about teams right after this. So Chuck tell us about the smiling faces on Team survive well, Josh teams FY was led by a man named Edward Curling or Edward I guess who is I take it as the only competent person in this entire mission. Yeah, he seemed like it, right, kind of a little more than the rest. Comparatively speaking, he seemed like a criminal genius. Yeah, that's a good point. Um. So he was also one of had gone to American to work, married a German woman there and then they worked together as butler, butler and cook for a little while, and then he said, you know what, I don't like you anymore. I think I want an American woman. So he did that and then, uh, when the war broke out, he tried to sail to Germany. Right, So I'm not sure if he was a mastermind either. Another thing about it, well, he showed a lot of initiative. Well, good point, and he was turned back by the um the coast Guard. But he finally made it to Germany UM in nineteen forty and he ended up working at the Ministry of Propaganda. Yeah, I guess, huh yeah, sure. And when he tried to um sail to Germany that one time, he actually had a guy with him named Um, was it Herbert new Bauer. I believe that was a new Bauer on his boat. Yeah, he was on that crew, and so he would have been turned back as well. So, um, he was a natural fit, right, and each other and Curling actually recommended Herman new Bauer uh to be part of the team. He's like, he can hoist a sail. Yeah, what else do you need? That he was in the boone who cares that was the youngest member of his crew at twenty two? Was Herbert helped? And um, he moved to the U S when he was just five years old. And so I don't know that he was a great choice because he was practically American. Yeah, and you know he was also not so smart, or put it this way, experienced. He was not experienced, right, A little a little green, a little wet behind the ears. Um. And then the last guy, Werner Thiel, he surprised surprise as a member of the boond and he was working in a war plant. So just this weird hodgepodge rag tag group of guys were selected. Only two people out of the whole original twelve or had been in the military. This sounds like a movie in the making, but it just if it would have had a great third act, it probably would already be a movie. Oh yeah, you know what I'm saying. Yeah, it is lack a third act. I imagine like when if someone had tried to develop this, like this sounds great so far, it's going great, and then that's how it ends. Yeah, shel fit. Yeah. Um. So these guys are put together. They're sent to the over school to learn jiu jitsu, and the old guy, George Josh is like low kick low kick, Oh my hip, yeah you know. Yeah. They were also studying like explosive techniques and wiring, not just explosive jiu jitsu technique, but real explosive wiring, detonation timers, all of this stuff. They got to go on field trips to um power plants and bridges and canals and see like where the weak points were um and all of this took place over an intensive eighteen days of training. That's it. They got eighteen days of training. Yeah, and apparently Josh, the leader of Team Inns, wasn't even I read one account this said he basically kind of snoozed through most of it, which would go on to explain a few things later it's hilarious. Eighteen days and you can't even stay awake to learn how to blow something up. Seriously. Um, all right, one, they were given their assignment, um, and these were I mean this was pretty smart. The assignments were. They had a good they had a good plan in place. Small teams of dudes. Uh Dash's team was assigned to destroy quite a few things. Um, hydro electric plants at Niagara Falls, the Aluminum Company of America factory in Illinois, Tennessee, New York three plants, and the Philadelphia Sault Company's cryolite plant, which apparently supplies raw materials for aluminum. Right. And the reason they want wanted to go after aluminium was because aluminum production in the United States the output was greater than all of Europe's both sides access and or no, I'm sorry. All of the access is aluminum production put together. And aluminium is a very very valuable thing. During war you used to make air craft frames. You use it to make um, the interiors of ships. Apparently you use it for everything from like m R. E's, like the field ration tink hands or well not tin cans, aluminum can but all of this stuff comes in handy. And if you can sure pin wheels like the good ones, if you um put those man, you can cut your finger off with one of those things. Uh. If you can cripple aluminum production, you can put a serious thing in the wartime effort. Yeah, it was. It was a smart play. Um. And then they are also told to bomb um locks on the Ohio River between Louisville, Kentucky and Pittsburgh. Yes, so disrupting transportation that would have been a huge deal. They would just strap a bomb to a pack mule that was supposed to be pulling a boat along the canal and kaboom. So that's team mines. Yeah, team spy curling steam. They said, all right, you guys, we want you to concentrate on railroad because we saw during the American Civil War destroying railroads is a great way to cripple and army. Um they blew. And I don't think that's where they got the idea. You know, it's long been a wartime thing to destroy railroads. I see Pennsylvania Railroad station at Newark. Uh, the Horseshoe Bend section of railroad track near Altoona, Pennsylvania, Chesapeake and Ohio railroad parts of it, the New York Central Railroads, Hell Gate Bridge locks and canals in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Ohio, and the water supply system of New York. Right. And they were also told to carry out acts of general terrorism to scare people in general, bombing Jewish own department stores, UM, locker rooms at UM train stations, just basically just foment like real fear and make Americans feel like, wow, America is being struck. Yeah, we're vulnerable. Um. And so the guy said, okay, let's do this, and they they they shipped out on two different subs from Lorient, France. U boats Baby, this is Germany, Yeah, okay, U boats. Um. They left on U five eighty four in U two oh two and um they had each team had four boxes, three of like dynamite and other explosives, and then a fourth box of things like timers and UM detonators and wiring and all that stuff. Sausages sure, just in case they got a little hungry on the trip. Yeah it was Germans after all. They also had a lot of money and roughly about a million dollars today UM. At the time each group had fifty grand and they needed this to travel and to live and to bribe people and pay folks off right in cash. So they had and what's equal to about a million dollars today in cash on them and nothing greater than a fifty bill. That's a lot of money, like physically a lot of money. Each member was given nine thousand five of which it was his very funny like team leader is going to hold onto this and you can keep for yourself and your money belt and only carry like four fifty in your pocket, and um, that should be enough dough to carry out this plan was the idea, yep, and then the uh. The team leaders also got handkerchiefs that had um the names and addresses and things of contacts in invisible ink written on them. Yeah. So this is like a bona fide spy, yes, bionage terrorism operation. Again, great movie in the making so far, so the m And again I think you said before that like Hitler was planning on sending several waves or wave after wave. Apparently the schedule was every six weeks they were going to send one, one or two teams to the United States. Yeah, I got, I mean it was a really smart and scary plan. Um, because catching you know, a tiny team of four guys who can assimilate as Americans, um or at least good German Americans. That's that's tough to catch. So chuck you uh two O two, which actually left two days after you. Eight four showed up off like fifty yards off the shoreline of Long Island and just frightening the thing about. Yeah, there was a German U boat fifty yards off of the shore of Long Island. UM on June twelve, showed up about eight in the evening and it belches out its cargo of um box of explosives and saboteurs, and the dudes um as they're rowing to shore, they put they were wearing like German military uniforms. Yeah. I didn't fully and this didn't make a ton of sense to me. Oh well, if you were caught in playing was behind enemy lines. The rules of war state that you can be shot on site, but if you're caught as a German marine prisoner of war and you have to be, that was taking a chance. I would addressed as an American. No, I mean, like I think that was smart. Yeah, I don't know. I would have addressed. I would have tried to assimilate, not been like, I'm a German marine, You're you're supposed to take me hostage, right, But I think it would be yeah, come on, let's go, I'm taking you hostage, whereas if the guy had been like, you're a spy, I am allowed to kill you right here and now. Yeah, I just I don't know. I don't agree with that one, but hey, everyone has their own rules when it comes to saboteuring. So sabotaging, right, yes, sabotaging. I was just kidding anyway, And I've learned recently that that was of um, that's that words of recent providence. Did you know that, like it didn't come into use until the beginning of the twentieth century. That makes sense. I would have thought it was a fairly old word. Yeah, nope. Did we just think of sabotage or do we just start calling it that? Like? Did they not used to sabotage back in the day. Yeah, I think they just started calling it that. Okay, So, um, the so this is Dash's team team since team mines, and they show up on the shore and they're wearing again German military uniforms, which they took off really quickly, very quickly. Yeah, once they saw that. You know, Okay, we made it. Yeah, the operation has begun. They changed, right, Yeah, they changed clothes and they started uh I guess they put on there I love New York shirts and they started digging big holes in the beach to to bury these munitions so they could come back as needed when they wanted to blow something new up. Yes, they can't just carry that stuff around, No, and they needed to just stash everything and go and cool out and make sure that no one was like onto him or anything like that, and then come back and get it, like you said, as they need. Yeah. The plan was to meet up for the two teams to meet up in Cincinnati on July four, UM for a baseball game. That is what I'm imagining. Yeah, the Reds versus the Braves. I don't know where the Braves were then, probably Milwaukee, sure, Okay, I don't think they moved to Atlanta until the sixties. Yeah, but I was trying to think of Boston, but they were that was long before so um. The team in inst was it was changing. They just landed. They were in the midst of changing when they were discovered by coast guardsman. Yeah. Well one of them was that Josh climbed over a dune and while the other guys were still bearing and changing uh their clothes, and he walked up and there was a coast guard dude, John Cullen, standing right there, and he was like, hey, what you're doing, basically, and the guy was like, oh, nothing and uh he uh. He apparently was kind of handling things when comes over and Burger thought that so the team Inns had been rowed to shore by two German sailors, and I guess Burger lost track of the German sailors and assume that they were still there and that for some reason it was only Josh four guys plus the two right. And then Josh had climbed over the dune to talk to one of the sailors. So Burger comes up and asks the question in German, and the coastguardsman, John Cullen, is like, why are you speaking German? We're at war with Germany. What's going on? And at that point Josh tells Burger to get Yeah. He said, you fool, go back to the others. And the guy was like, what others? Wait a minute, And so Josh's story was that they were um fisherman stranded Fisherman and before he got really suspicious, Cullen, the guy from the Coastguard said, well, if you guys are Shannon Fisherman's yeah, we have a Coastguard like house party house up the beach. We just ordered some pizza. Come with me. You guys can eat some pizza and um chill out. And Josh is like, well, uh, we don't have any idea on us. Yeah, we don't fishing permits either. We don't want to get in trouble. And I was like, well, you're telling a guy from the coast guy that, so you're in trouble first of all, but secondly that strikes me as weird. About that time, Burger comes up asked his question in German, and Josh sees the writing on the wall and tells Um tells Colin, well, he says, do you have a mother and Colin says yes, And he goes do you have a father? Says yes, and Dash says, well, then I wouldn't want to kill you, So how about I give you some money you can forget that this ever happened. And he tries to give him a hundred bucks and Colin says nope, yeah, he says no, thank you, um, and he said He ends up giving him two hundred and sixty dollars and Colin basically realize that something was going down and I just needed just take this money and act like I'm down with the take and get out of here. So so he does, so he does. He's scaddles and then oh but not before this is very key piece. Actually, Josh grabbed his flashlight before he left and shined it on his own face and said, you will be meeting me in East Hampton sometime soon. Do you know who I am? And then guy was like, no, I don't know who you are. And he said my name is George John Davis, which was a lie. Uh well, it was his real alias for the mission though, so like he actually gave him his real alias, and he said what's your name? And um, Colin said Frank Collins, which was a lie. Which was a lie. Pretty quick thinking and um, basically he scrambled back and Josh came back over and was like, little seeing there, guys, I totally took care of it. Should not be a big deal. Don't even worry about paying the guy two sixty. Yeah, we're good. Yeah, So everybody finished bearing these boxes, which they did, and um Colin ran off and went and grabbed some of his fellow Coast guardsmen. By the time they got back, Team Science had left a train. But apparently, and this is another thing, so the U boat that dropped off Team Acience had grounded itself on a sandbar and was sitting there like trying to get back out to sea because Dawn was just rocked back and forth in your chair? Was that that's what it looked, was that the method in there? Yeah, it just moved right exactly. And finally the tide came in just enough for them to dislodge themselves and go back out of seat, just in time. But apparently um Colon and the other Coast Guards wanh it came back, caught sight of this U boat heading back out to sea. Not good, right, No German U boat off the coast of Long Island just ran into some guys who are speaking German and tried to pay you off. And then now all of a sudden, in the moonlight, you can see the ghostly outlines of four freshly dug holes in the sand. Let's see what's in there. Yeah, I wonder if um i couldn't find. I saw that about the boat being stuck, but I couldn't find if that was like, if they could have gotten away, you know, it could have all changed. They may not have been that suspicious. I think that Collen was suspicious. Yeah, he was definitely coming back, but seeing the U boat was just icing on the cake exactly. Okay, so the other dudes had hop date. Well, they dug up the holes and they found the stuff and said, okay, um, this is a huge deal. Yeah, we just found a trove of explosives in German military uniforms buried on the beach, like sixty miles from New York. Yeah, so Toots sweet. By ten twenty three that morning, those boxes were in the office of New York City Police Captain John Bayliss, who then promptly got in touch with the FBI, and by noon that day, thirteen hours after they had arrived, the FBI had all that stuff in custody, and j Edgar Hoover said, there's a to get a blackout on the news, so these guys don't get wise to this, and we need to get the largest man hunting FBI history underway. And they did, and we will explore that and all the ways the FBI got some lucky breaks on this right after these messages. All right, so Team Science, let's recap here. They are in Manhattan. They go shopping at Macy's. Of course. Yeah, we got a lot of cash. All they had with them was the clothes the civilian, the clothes they brought and all that cash. Yeah, that was it. Everything else is buried back to the beach, but is now an FBI custody unbeknownst to these guys. That's right. So they go shopping at Macy's. They split into they said, let's split up into pairs, because that makes sense. Uh, Kieran and uh he checked into the hotel Martinique ssh and Burger I went to the Governor Clinton hotel Governor Bill Clinton, and uh, I don't think so. And um, unless he was named after the hotel, Oh yeah, I never know. That's why he always wanted to be governor. And so apparently, um, Josh and Burger met. He summoned Burger to his hotel room up on a tall floor and opened the window and said, I've got a plan and I'm gonna tell you about it, and if you're on board, you're on board. But if you're not, then one of us is leaving through the door. One of us is leaving through the window. He basically threw down the gauntlet Burg to Burger, I wow, I didn't realize that. Yeah, And so Burger he basically said, I would like to turn and sabbothe tour, sabotage the sabotage, and go against Germany. And because America is kind of great. So Josh was going to kill Burger if Burger can go along with it. That's what he said. And apparently Burger had the choice to like, or you can you can defeat you and throw you out the window where you can triumph and be the living victor. Yeah. So I think Burger was just on board. And they said that in this article that um Josh probably was telling the truth that he was. He was really this was his idea from the beginning. So here's the here's the question. Like, historically speaking, Josh has been uh seen as a genuine betrayer of this mission. Sure, but when he became a genuine betrayer of the mission is is issue? Still? According to this history and that article, either he he knew it before they even landed, and that that is why he showed his face and gave his real alias to John Colin on the beach, which makes sense, or his encounter with John Colin on the beach rattled him enough that he was like, this is never gonna work. We're already we're already dead in the water. That's a quick turn. So now I'm going to go ahead and betray it. Yeah. I say that he was in on it from the beginning. That's what that's my feeling, because he was in sicycle. Just I don't know, it seems like a really quick like they just land on the beach. Five minutes later he meets a guy and he's like, wait a minute, it's off. I'm gonna betray Germany. It just seemed I don't know, a little too hasty. Well maybe he had nerves of spaghetti. Yeah, cook spaghetti. Even so, uh, he says, here's the plan, the on Monday burger. Yeah, he said, on Monday, I'm gonna go to the head. They closed the window by now I think said they went to dinner and everything was good, and he said, I'm gonna go to Uh, I'm gonna go to Washington meet with j Edgar Hoover. That should be pretty easy to get that meeting. The man himself, Yeah, here he wears nothing but a caper on the office, and he said, you go back to the other two guys and just sort of occupied them for a little while while I'm going to d C and requesting a meeting with the FBI. The head of the FBI, um so Burger, says do this. Josh says, okay. It's Sunday, and Josh doesn't make his way to d C until Thursday morning. Instead, he goes so remember he was a waiter in America. Well, he called. He called the FBI first, at least right and the reason why he called first he was a little worried because apparently back in UM in a training camp in the woods, cop Falter Cop had said, you guys don't need to worry, we have a man on the inside of the FBI. So Um, Josh was worried that if he called, or if he just showed up at FBI headquarters he talked to that one guy right out of all the FBI guys, he would have that that level of bad luck, which, from what I understand, that was something that was a good concern for her to have um. So he called the New York Bureau first and said, I'm a German dude, I've got information for Jacker Hoover. Tell him I'm coming. And then he hung up, and he went to a club for waiters and then played pinuckle for like two straight days. Yeah, I get I think he was probably gambling. That's what I think too, because if I'm not mistaken with the math, he ended up with more money than he came with. Yeah, so he wentn't gambled with sabotage money. I think. So, Man, that guy is some serious. He's pretty awesome. Uh So, eventually he said, all right, I gotta go to Washington. This peanuckle game has dried up. So he hopped on the Sella Express for Washington, which I highly recommend. By the way, man, train travel is awesome. Regional train travel is a delight, such a delight, And especially from Boston to New York. You just right along the coastline there and it's just lovely. It is lovely. Sailboats and cape cod houses on points, lobster rolls. Yeah, it's nice, good stuff. All right. So Josh has arrived by train finally. By this point, team spy has landed. Yeah, show up in Florida and they're like, let's do this for real. And I imagine Pontevedra Beach in three It was a pretty low key scenario for sure, you know, yeah, I would think so. So they are twenty five miles south of Jacksonville. They bury their crates, no sweat, hop on a bus, go to Jacksonville. Um. They split up from that point to went to Cincinnati too, went to Chicago. Yeah, and like I mean, there was no must There wasn't like any no one was calling the FBI like they were in it to win it basically. Yeah, why they should have done Team I should have done their recond beforehand. The U boat should have not pulled up next to a Coastguard station first of all. That would have been one thing. Yeah, because that Coastguard station was like half a mile away. Yeah, it was there. All right, maybe they're bad until so, uh Josh gets to d C, checks into the Mayflower Hotel. Yeah, this is the same day that Caroling's group lands in Pontevedra. It's a big day, huge day. Uh, And he in d C said all right, I'm gonna call the FBI again because you gotta meet with Hoover, and he reached out to a Dwayne Trainer, and of course, Trainer says, you know, this is probably not a legitimate call. We get these kind of weird calls all the time, but just in case, um, let's go pick him up. Yeah, let's let's see what's going on. It's a slow day at headquarters. Yeah exactly. So they go and pick up the German and they bring him to the Justice Department, and Dash said that he was basically bounced from agent to agent every He's kind of a hot potato on nobody wanted to deal with him, And finally he convinced these guys enough to end up in the office of Mickey Ladd, who was running the man hunt for the spies, and the head of the Spies was now sitting in his office, Yeah, telling him he's the head of the spies, and he still didn't quite believe him until Dash said, oh, yeah, well here, let me show you this and dumped out dollars on Lad's desk and Lads said, I'm so pleased you came in today. Come with me. Yeah, so, Josh, here's here's his idea. Is I want to talk to Hoover himself, because I'm gonna be a hero and I might even get like a medal of honor out of this, right, Like maybe Jagger will have me over to his house for dinner. Who knows what could come of this. Take your tape parade, They threw those all the time back then. Um so they the FBI gets them talking. He does get to meet Hoover briefly, but um, a couple of other agents take his deposition, which lasts for thirteen hours. Before he finished, he had told them about Burger and where Burger was, and they went and picked up Burger. Yeah, he like, while he was still telling him the story, they were already on Burger's hotel staking him out. Yep, so they before they picked up Burger, they were staking him out, like you said. And they watched Burger go meet Karen and Hink and so they just arrested all three of them, and all all of a sudden, they had team in custody within like a day of um dash walking in the FBI headquarters. It didn't go so well for team I No, so when when the team leader betrays you, like, yeah, you're you're in trouble. Your toast so on June twenty two, Hoover wrote to f d R and said, you know what, sir, we've we've caught all the members of this group that landed on Long Island. Pretty great, huh and we are awesome. Um. He didn't mention that the guy turned himself in and told him where everyone was, and uh so FDR was just thought that Hoover had done like a bang up job basically, and he's like, wait, way to go, way to do your job exactly. He lied pretty much, so um Dash had no real leads or anything about team, but he did have a handkerchief that had contacts on invisible inc. And surprisingly he hadn't blown his nose in it at this point, but he and remember how you were supposed to get the invisible ink to become visible. Luckily, the FBI had a crack team of lab Tex on this thing and they figured it out. And now all of a sudden they had the names and addresses of all of the German contexts for these teams right there in their hands, thanks to Josh Right. So they were all obviously staked out, just waiting on Team Heights or I'm sorry, Team Spy to meet up with these people, right, which they did. But first teams FI did some other weird stuff like Herbert hopped. He was in Chicago, where again he had lived since he was five, and Holpe decided that he would buy a Pontiac car. Yea, yeah. He went to his parents house, told his dad everything. Yeah, I had his dad buy in the car. Yep, and um, he proposed to his girlfriend. He remember he had left during the war and he was an able bodied man over age eighteen, and so the local draft board um wanted to know where he was. So he dropped by FBI headquarters to clear up his draft problem. Says I'm back. Sorry, I've already registered with my local draft board. No need to track me anymore. I'm just an all American boy. And um the FBI was like, yeah, sure, thank you for coming by, and then tailed them on the way out, and then he led them to at least one other team member, right yeah. And while this was going on, Curling and verner Thiel went to New York UM and met up with a friend named Helmet Lena because they wanted to have sex with a lady, and so Lena hooked him up with the mis his mistress said here, have sex with her, and he said great, thanks, and he ended up traveling with that woman. Curling did and within a couple of days after Dash surrendered. Um, they spotted Curling because they were trailing him at a bar where he met with Deal, and they arrested both of those guys. Right, So two down on team Spy about help, I'm sorry, three down at this point. Right, Hope was taken down in Chicago. The only one left at this point was Herman new Bauer. Right, and new Bauer spent his time in was it in New York? Uh? I think he was in chick Okay, you're probably right. Um, he just went to the movies over and over again. That's what he did. He was apparently lonely, so he sought out some friends of his wife, whom he hadn't really met before. Umthing told him everything. He gave him his money for safekeeping, but kept enough to go to the movies a bunch. So basically he kept a dollar right, and um, okay, dollar fifty and h then he um was I think he just come back from the movies when the FBI picked him up. Right, So Dash remember is sure that like he's going to be feted as a herero that Jaker Hoover is probably like thinking about him right then, he's just like basically like Ralphie in a Christmas story, just daydreaming about like how he's going to be carried around on everyone's shoulders. He probably should have been so, I mean, he's the reason why this went south because he said, you know what, I'm siding with America. The thing is Hoover. He didn't care Jager Hoover. Not only did he not care, Hoover was taking the credit for all of this unraveled, right. He couldn't let Josh be known as this guy who had come and um given him this whole thing on a platter, or else Hoover would look like an idiot, and Josh might very well have been hailed as at least a slimy collaborators rather than a criminal. After everybody was rounded up, the FBI arrested Josh, and Josh must have been quite surprised by this. Well, yeah, they arrested him, but they said, hey, just go along with this. You'll get a full presidential pardon after six months. Sort of play along with the arrest, and he was like, Okay, I see so put me in the jail with the other guys so they don't know yeah exactly. It was like, yeah, sure, well, because that job with Hooper's planned to keep it all quiet still exactly was working out great for Hoover, it didn't work out great for Josh or the others. Chuck No. So um FDR wanted to make sure that he could get the death penalty and that this could be kept quiet. So he as he formed a military tribunal to try these guys, and it was the first one since um Lincoln had been assassinated. It was a big deal. So the prosecutor was Attorney General Francis Biddle, chief defense was Colonel Kenneth Royal Um. They defense argued initially for a civilian trial that was quickly scrapped and they said, no, we're going to move forward with the tribunal and held the trial out the Justice Department in Washington during the month of July nine and basically said, we know the whole there's not going to be much of a trial, fellas, we know everything because you told us everything. You are coming here to sabotage and blow up our junk and you're in big trouble. Right, And the prosecutors sought the death penalty as expected. Um, but it was up to FDR to decide when and where, and to do that he had to have a transcript of the trial. And when he got this transcript of the trial, he it became obvious that Hoover hadn't really done anything. Yeah. Appinently FDR never called him out on it in public, No, which was a nice thing to do, I guess, because that would have just been further embarrassment for like the whole country, you know. So they kept that quiet, but at this point it was news all over the country. They weren't keeping it quiet with a press, uh. And the American public was way in favor of the death penalty. In fact, there was an open letter published in one newspaper calling for them to be fed to Gargantua, the guerrilla at the Wringling Brothers circuit, because that's fair to Gargantua too, Yeah, eat those Germans. Well. Instead, they electrocuted six of them on August eight of the District jail in Washington, d C. That's right, um, including Herbert Hout who was just like, I just wanted up Pontiac, Yeah, I just wanted to see my parents. Right, Burger and Uh and Josh were spared the death penalty because they basically had a hard time proving in court that they didn't you know, fully intend to betray the operation. Yeah, exactly, So they did not get electrocuted. Um. They were sentenced Burger too hard labor for the rest of his life, and Josh was given thirty years. But President Truman commuted their sentences, released them and deported them, had them shipped to UM West Germany. West Berlin said don't come back, Nope, get out, and the other guys were buried in a potter's field by the way and outside Washington, Yes, which is now UM the d C Municipal Water treatment plant where they were buried. Yeah, just right now. They're part of the system, I guess Um. And so Josh and Burger go back to Germany and Burger starts like feeding the media Um the story basically five years later and blames Right and blames Josh for the deaths of these other six German patriots who were saboteurs. Right and Josh Um tried to publicly clear himself through he first saw to pardon in America so that he could come back. He really wanted to get that Germany, Yeah, I can imagine, um, and Uh America said, no, we're not going to do that. We're not going to pardon you. We're still mad at you. Germany said, we're mad at you too, and so he just kind of faded out of the public spotlight. Ye. He he ended up dying in nineteen at the age of eighty nine, and I didn't see any follow up or Burger for Burger. I think he wasn't quite as vilified as Doosh was, right for sure. But that was not the last time the Germans sent saboteurs ashore. There was at least one other ill fated attempt in another German submarine. These are expensive boats. Many, they are really taking a massive risk to drop off a couple of saboteurs. But they did it again off off of Maine in a snowstorm, and two uh former American residents German Americans, um, we're we're sent off under the main coast in a snowstorm. They were seen by a local boy scout using a compass during the snowstorm on the side of the road, and the boy scout was suspicious, so he traced their tracks all the way back to the shoreline when they come out of nowhere and he's like, I'm going to call the police. So the scouts actually called these guy. Yeah, that's pretty cool. What's ironic is one of these German American saboteurs was a boy scout himself, so it's like boy scout on boy scout tattling um. And they got picked up immediately, and as far as everybody knows, that's the last time Germany ever tried that. Yeah. I think the idea was that hitler Um. It's like this, this is embarrassing. Yeah, let's just focus on the rocket program. Yeah, we can't keep sending guys to the United States who immediately get there and start doing stupid things giving themselves up. Go and see mom and Dad seeing the movies playing p knockle. So that's it. That's the story of the time the Nazis invaded Florida and New York and Maine. Uh. If you want to know more about that, check out history Net, check out damn interesting, check out all sorts of stuff. Yes, just search it. You'll find all sorts of cool things on it. I would not look for the movie coming soon into a theater near you know, the third act non existent? Not really, No, it's just kind of a let down. Yeah, that end with a bang hands with Germany being mad at them in America too. Uh let's see. I think I said Germany's mad, which means it's time for listener, ma'am.
