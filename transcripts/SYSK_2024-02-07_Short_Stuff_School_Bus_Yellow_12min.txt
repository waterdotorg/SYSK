Josh: Hey, and welcome to the short stuff. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck, and there's Cherry and the driver's seat hopping along, bouncing along in our little stuff. You should know school bus.

00:00:14
Chuck: Two quick questions off the top. Did you ever have to ride a school bus to school with regularity?

00:00:20
Josh: I've got two words for that.

00:00:21
Chuck: Oh yes, and please tell me you do. Do you remember the name of your school bus driver?

00:00:29
Josh: I got several words.

00:00:30
Chuck: No.

00:00:31
Josh: I feel really bad that I don't now that you ask, But no, I don't remember the name of my school bus driver.

00:00:37
Chuck: Oh that's okay. You may have had several. I have a theory that like a school bus driver, if you have the same one as one of those, that kind of sticks with you. Even though my dad was my principal, I usually rode to work with dad, but I did ride the school bus some because you want to as a kid. Some Ruby's dying to ride a school bus, but they don't have one at her school and it's always sad when she sees them. But I had. Mister Wagnan was my school bus driver, which is interesting now that I think of it, because before school buses, you might have been taken to school in a wagon.

00:01:14
Josh: That was pretty good. Segue man. It's been a little while, Yeah, it's true. Until the nineteen thirties, the late thirties, actually the forties probably. Yeah. If you were a rural kid, a rod duror or the kid of a rod ur and you wanted to get to school, you very well may have been taken to school in a horse and buggy essentially, or a cart, farm cart, maybe a truck, who knows, whatever could get you to school, that's what you got to school. And because there was no federal system or standardization across the United States, there was whatever your school district could think of to get you to school. And even trying to get you to school was a fairly new concept in the early twenty century after industrialization drew everyone to the cities, because the school was in the city, that's where most people were. You know, before that it was like good luck getting to school. Now I was like, okay, we really need to get you to school because we have to train you to work in these factories.

00:02:14
Chuck: Dumb, dumb, exactly. Thankfully there was a gentleman and this is just kind of the perfect short stuff. While we invented short stuff was because of topics like this, like why your school bus is yellow, It's because of a man named Frank sear See y R. He was born in a rural area. He was raised on a farm in Nebraska, and as he grew up he got to be in his bonnet to advocate for the education of people in rural areas. He was a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, and he started studying school transportation. He was like, I'm sure. He was like, you know what, I got taken to school in a truck maybe or maybe it was even a wagon back then. And we got a real hit and miss system going on here. So we need to protect kids, keep them safe on the way to school. And a good way to start that is nine years later, in nineteen thirty nine, he organized a conference in New York City about improving and standardizing the American school bus.

00:03:17
Josh: Yeah, and it was a success. He didn't just get crickets back. He got a lot of people, educators, people who were in charge of transportation for their counties, people who made buses all showed up to New York City in that nineteen thirty nine conference and he said, Okay, let's create these standards, and by the end of the conference, we're going to have come up with standards for school buses throughout the entire United States. And now it's just like, you know, big whoop. But if you go back and think about it, especially that this just didn't exist and he created it out of thin air, it's a pretty cool accomplishment actually, because he was successful immediately.

00:03:56
Chuck: Yeah. Absolutely, that's why. You know, when you get on a school bus, you're gonna have the same width of the aisle, the seats are going to be basically the same, the doors and the dimensions of this stuff are going to be the same. But what Frank's here is really really known for is school bus yellow or the official name is National school Bus Glossy Yellow.

00:04:18
Josh: Pretty great name.

00:04:19
Chuck: I love it.

00:04:20
Josh: It's a mouthful. But the reason that that was part of the standardization too was, as Frank Seer's son William put it, that whenever you saw a bus that color, you'd think, Okay, there's a bunch of kids going somewhere. Yeah, you just associated with this. So that meant they needed an eye catching color that wasn't already widely used, that they could associate with school buses and that's exactly what they came up with.

00:04:48
Chuck: Yeah. So, as the story goes, Sere was looking at colors in his office was really drawn to all these colors on the orange spectrum, different kinds of yellows, yellow greens, stuff like that, because he wanted something that stood out. And at that nineteen thirty nine meeting he brought fifty cheese. He narrowed it down to fifty choices. I probably would have brought like three maybe, but he brought fifty choices, hung them on the wall and said, all right, we need a special committee. We're all going to decide on this. And they chose that sort of yellowish orange color originally called National school Bus Chrome, and that was it. He published a forty two page booklet saying here's the standards that we're proposing, and that pamphlet was school bus yellow.

00:05:36
Josh: Yeah. I say, we take a break and when we come back, we'll explain why that was such a great color for year to pick.

00:05:45
Speaker 3: Let's do it, okay, Chuck.

00:06:08
Josh: So Frank Seer and his conference members at that nineteen thirty nine conference, they came up with forty four dimensions for the school bus, or forty four standards for the school bus, and one of them was school bus glossy yellow. And Frank Seer was not a safety expert, he was not a visual scientist, he was not an optimologist. He didn't know anything, but he had a good gut for picking out what color would be the best one to pick, and that yellow was a really great color. Because as this guy who's interviewed, doctor Stephen Solomon, he's an optometrist and founder of a company called Visibility Emotion, which is a consulting group. He said that yellows are most easily seen by the human eye, not just for any people with normal vision, but even if you have red green colored deficiency, you still see yellow. And he basically said, like Frank Seer stumbled upon essentially the perfect safe color.

00:07:11
Chuck: Yeah, that's awesome. I love it.

00:07:14
Josh: The reason why yellow is so visible is because it stimulates both the red and the green cones. We've got red, green, and blue cones and it just sets two of them a flame. Right, So even if you have red green color blindness, you can't differentiate red or green. Yellow says, hey what about neither? And you can still see yellow.

00:07:36
Chuck: I love it. So it works for almost everybody. Imagine there's somebody that probably can't see yellow, right.

00:07:42
Josh: Yeah, I guess, but they're probably just being contrarian.

00:07:45
Chuck: Yeah. Maybe so Frank's here passed away in nineteen ninety five, but obviously was able to see his vision. I imagine every time Frank's here was out on the road and saw one of those yellow school buses, he probably felt a little little warm in his tom thumbs. I know I would. So these days, any school bus in the United States of America that is sold or lease they have to meet all those federal safety standards and be painted that color. I do think it's funny. And we're going to cover this kind of quickly. That and this is something I've always wondered that they got together. They said, all right, let's get forty four standards, width of stuff, heights of stuff. But we're all in agreement. No seat belts, right.

00:08:29
Josh: I know, it's crazy.

00:08:31
Chuck: I've always wondered about that, but it kind of makes sense when it's explained here. And by the way, big thanks to Dave Ruse. This is one of his short articles from housti works dot com. But school buses don't drive super fast, they don't hit like when they are in an accident. It's usually not the kind of thing where like there's a very fast stop. They're heavy, they're slow, they don't stop suddenly if there's an accident. I mean they plow through whatever they're hitting. Is in reality what happens. So the seat belts, Like for a kid fifteen rows back plowing through a Prius at twenty three miles an hour, that kid's not going to go go flying, you know, eighteen feet through the front windshield.

00:09:18
Josh: That kid'll just be like, hey, watch the speed.

00:09:20
Chuck: Bumps, mister wagnan. But school buses are very heavily regulated and very safe. They are compartmentalized, so you know, those seats are very closely spaced for that reason. They have energy absorbing backs for that reason. There's all sorts of rollover protection and crush standards and stuff like that. So school buses are safe. They just don't have seat belts.

00:09:46
Josh: Statistically speaking, they're safe too. Apparently in the United States, any given weekday, twenty six million American kids ride to school on a school bus. And I looked up a lot of trouble finding this, but I'm pretty sure what I found was that that's more than twenty percent of the people on the road in the United States and any given weekday. Wow, and yet it represents less than one percent of all traffic fatalities.

00:10:13
Chuck: Now was that rush hour stats?

00:10:15
Josh: I don't know, man, I tried really hard. I couldn't find anything nuanced like that. I basically had to cobble it together myself. So what I found was that on the on the road something like thirty six percent of Americans drive any given day. So I took that and figured out how many Americans there are? Was thirty six percent of that percentage is twenty six million that number, and that's where I came up with more than twenty percent.

00:10:43
Chuck: No, no, no, I like it. I think it tracks, and I think that we will definitely hear from someone who thinks they have found a better way to calculate that. But just the eyeball test. When I'm driving Ruby to school in the morning, we see a lot of school buses, Oh yeah, everywhere.

00:10:56
Josh: You do not want to get behind one.

00:10:59
Chuck: No, and you do want to stop though if that arm goes out, because that is a I don't know if it's true, but I heard that that is like the second worst moving violation you can get behind, like a dui. I don't know if that's true, but I know it is a hefty fine. They don't take lightly.

00:11:16
Josh: It seems like it should be. And I mean, even if the cops don't get you, there's people who will chase you in their car if they see you do that. It's a really gross violation of like social standards.

00:11:28
Chuck: It is you don't do that.

00:11:30
Josh: No, you're like, I don't care about children's lives, is what you're saying. I need to get to Starbucks, I need to get to Cracker Barrel. I need to get somewhere that's more important than a child's life, is what you're shouting at everyone.

00:11:43
Chuck: You know, who else didn't care about children's lives? Is that guy who kidnapped that school bus, yellow school bus in Chowchilla. Yeah, buried that thing.

00:11:51
Josh: That's right, You got anything else?

00:11:54
Chuck: No, that's a past episode Chowchilla school kidnapping. Look it up. It's great.

00:11:59
Josh: Yeah. Hats off to Frank Seer and heads off to Short Stuff, which is out.
