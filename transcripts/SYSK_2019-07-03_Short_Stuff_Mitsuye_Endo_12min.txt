Josh: Hey, and welcome to short stuff. I'm Josh, and there's Chuck and there's Jerry over there. So this short stuff because it's shorter, that's right. And this is one of my favorite kinds of short stuff, kind of tailor made for a short stuff when you have a little bit of information about a great person in history who never got their due, but there's not a lot much more known about them, right, so you can talk about her in this case and twelve minutes or so her and him. Yeah, good, it'll be thirteen minutes. That's right. And this is the story on the her part of mitsu yi Indo. Nicely done, I think so. I'm pretty sure too, Okay. Mitsu Yi Endo was born in Sacramento. Wait where was she born Sacramento, California? Which is an important point here, Chuck, because from being born in Sacramento, California, in he was an American citizen, natural born. That's right. She was one of four kids to Japanese immigrants. Um, and got a job working for the government. She was went to secretary school and then worked as a secretary for the Department of Employment. Full blooded born American working for the state government. Right, um, and she was working for the state government in December of nineteen one when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and the sentiment towards the Japanese in America turned sharply at that point, um so much so that I believe the next year UM, the President at the time, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, issued an executive order called Executive Order nine oh six six, which we have recorded on before. That's right, we did a whole episode on this. But Executive Order nine oh six six basically said, anyone of Italian American, German American or Japanese American ancestry is basically fair game to have their constitutional and civil rights utterly stripped from them during this crisis of wartime, just because we're not sure if they might do something hinky to disrupt America's wartime effort. Right. So, within just a few months of December seventh, nineteen UM, the United States dismissed all Japanese American state employees, which included Mitsui Indo. UM. Hundreds of people affected, and sixty three of those people were brave enough to get together and challenge the firings, and they had a little backing by the Japanese American Citizens League, and they got together and they hired a very cool dude uh an attorney named James C. Purcell, Yeah, who was not at all Japanese, had no Japanese ancestry, and him whatsoever. He just saw that this was not right. He saw something that wasn't right, and he decided to take on this case. Um. And so the being summarily fired because you are of Japanese ancestry, not a Japanese immigrant, but like an American born person of Japanese ancestry. That's bad enough. But under this executive order, in this kind of wartime hysteria, things got way worse for Japanese Americans, especially ones on the West Coast, because part of this executive order was basically like, hey, military, do what you need to do. In the military said, well, we figured we should probably clear the West coast of anybody like that. We're going to forcibly remove Japanese Americans from their homes and eventually into internment camps. And that's the episode we did. Yeah, Japanese in tournament. It was a good one. So they're basically incarcerated. Um, she and her family, And we should point out that her brother was serving in the U. S. Army. That's a huge point. It is huge point. Um. Her family was moved. She was moved a couple of times. They were at Tuley Lake at one point, which is a very famous uh internment camp that I think is still around as like a living museum. Um. But at what eventually she was separated from her family. They started by trying to keep families together, and then they just stopped doing that and people like mitsui Endo ended up being separated from her family, forced into a prison. It was a detainment detention center. If that sounds familiar, Yeah, exactly. Um. So Purcel's on the case. He's uh gotta be in his bonnet to help these people out, and he's trying to build a case. And what he needs is to find somebody, just one person who will step forward and who was brave enough to challenge their incarceration through habeas corpus petition, which is to say that basically, hey, I shouldn't be um incarcerated and I officially legally challenging my incarceration, right it means bring me the body. It's part of the magna carta I think, where it's basically says, bring the prisoner to me, the judge, and let me decide if they're being held illegally or not. We did an episode on that too, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, we definitely did something at some point on habeas corpus so. So mitsu Endo was a perfect test case or challenge case for this to pur sell because she um, she was a Methodist, she was a citizen and natural born citizen of the US, her brother was in the army, and she'd never even been to Japan in her entire life. But there's a big part of this, like, despite her just perfect um presentation, for a case like this, you have to convince her too. And part of Japanese culture is you don't stand out, number one. You certainly don't stand out by making trouble for the authorities. So it was extraordinarily brave when she finally agreed to be the case for all Japanese Americans who are being unconstitutionally treated by the US. Yeah, and that that was what did it. When he said, hey, listen, this is not for you, this is for everyone, and um, still slightly reluctant, she agreed and saw the bigger picture. Uh, and we're going to talk about the rest of our story and Purcell's right after this. M okay, chuck so um Mitsu yi Endo has agreed to have her case taken by Purcell on to basically challenge all of Executive Order nine oh six six in the constitutionality of it, right, And I think in pretty short order this case, um was people in government knew what was going on on the federal level, and they found out who she was and what her story was, and I think early on they were kind of like, oh, yeah, this probably doesn't look good for us. Wait, she's a methodist. Oh god, uh, this doesn't look great for us. So you know what, let her out. Um, she'll be fine, and just just let her out because she I think we probably did the wrong thing here. But she said no, and I guess also at Purcell's urging, she stayed and turned um and said, this is a societal issue. There's something much larger at play, and I want to I want to carry this like all the way to the top in the court system. Yeah, because the government said if you just drop this and go away, we'll let you out specifically, and she said, nope, that's pretty pretty cool. Man. Yeah, so um, she said no, and they kept uh, they kept um the case up all the way to the Supreme Court. Supreme Court heard it and just ruled unanimously that no, this is totally unconstitutional. What's happened to her? Um, It wasn't so much that the Supreme Court case that um, their decision in the end O case, that it closed the Japanese Internament camps, Japanese American Internament camps. That wasn't the what happened. What happened was it produced the pressure that convinced Roosevelt to shut down the Internament camps. Yeah, this is fairly cowardly, I think. Um. In the end, they did the quote unquote right thing. But it was only because this was looming. Apparently there was inside word and they got tipped off that like, hey, the Supreme Court is gonna come down against you, Roosevelt basically. Uh. And so the day after I'm sorry, the day before the Supreme Court handed down their decision, Um, Roosevelt came out and they said, oh, you know what, we're we're just gonna end this Internament thing right here, right. And then the next day the Supreme Court made like made public their decision and end which was Yeah, cowardly, I think it's a pretty good word about it. But there's no way of getting around that. It was the end O case that was the pressure that closed the internment camps, and so much so that, Um, there's a law professor named Amanda Tyler who's an expert on the case. She said that, Um, she's interviewed survivors of the Japanese internment camp Japanese American internment camp. Sorry, um, who considered Purcell as they refer to him as the man who set us free? Pretty amazing. It is pretty amazing. And Endo herself is very much regarded as a hero from this too. But she kept such a low profile that she um, her own daughter didn't even know the impact that she'd had until her daughter was well into her twenties. Yeah. She eventually made her way to Chicago, Um, after all this washed over. She worked as a secretary for the Mayor's Committee on Race Relations. A couple of years after that, married a man named Kenneth Sutsumi, and she had met him in an internment camp. Like tell me this is in a movie waiting to be made. They went on to have three kids and she kept a pretty low profile after that. Like you said, UM was not a braggart, Um, but it was. It was a big deal. And I think as like this has come out more in recent years. UM, she's definitely like gotten her due in certain corners. I wish the story was out wider. That's one reason we're doing this. But she lived in Chicago for the rest of her life. Eventually, very sadly died of cancer in two thousand and six, and so Shell kept practicing law right into his eighties. As a matter of fact. Yeah, that's great. UM. So this is this is noteworthy still today. Is that UM law Professor man of Tyler points out because there's an ongoing debate over whether the executive, the president and the executive branch has ultimately absolute power when it comes to matters of national security, especially during wartime UM, or if the courts still have of a check as the Constitution suggests that they do, over the executive's actions no matter what it is or no matter what the situation is, that the executive can't be absolutely right, no matter what and unquestioned by the court. Yes, And I think by constitution suggest you mean the Constitution clearly lays out in demands right, Well, it depends on your interpretation, right, So I guess that's it for short Stuff again, Chuck, nice selection. I think mitsuji Endo needs a parade every year and her honor agreed. Thanks a lot for joining us. Hope you enjoyed it.
