Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, the Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and there's Jerry the Stuff you Should Know herb. Have you ever heard a tupper Warrior burp? Yeah, sort of, I mean it, you know, it doesn't sound like a burb. It's just sort of like, can you emulate one? Well, it's just like a like air just sort of it's like a burb. It sounds like a dude, yeah, something different. Yeah, but I don't think you could call it a Tupperware bart because it probably wouldn't sell us. Well, even a burp is a little you know. Okay, So I guess I have heard one before when I was a kid, but I thought like there was like a burb or something like that, or do you remember that cartoon. It might have been like, h what was the Droopy I think it might have been a droopy cartoon, So some sort of cartoon where like they had a machine that burped radishes. But I like it. It was a great I think it was like the Kitchen of the Future, one great cartoon. Bert. That's what I assumed the Tupperware thing was like, yeah, that was a big droopy fans I thought I was missing out. Nope, no, it's just a little air being expelled. But it was a very very important bit of air, because Chuck. At the time that Tupperware came out, women were using like basically a pot that they cooked something in, maybe a bowl, and putting a shower cap over it and storing it in the ice box. You know what they call that primitive? That's primitive food storage. It sounds like a tuk tuk would have done something like that, not men and women in the nineteen forties, except he would have used like some sort of Madagascar type animal pelt sure them from the movie Madagascar. No, not Madagascar. I say, that's what I'm thinking of. I say, I haven't seen it one. So they're very similar. It is setting like different climbs in different time periods. I've never seen me either, different animal protagonists. I just I can get a lot from commercials. Yeah, uh so, yeah, Tupperware, let's let's talk about it. Um, the original patent. I love the name of this thing, and you know it was created. You want to drop this cool little fact by the name the name of the guy Earl Tupper. Yeah I never knew that. Yeah, I guess I didn't either. I didn't didn't think about it. No, you think of tupper war is nothing but tupper ware, and there's no Tupper who invented It's crazy talk, right, Yeah, No, there was a tupper named Earl and that tupper tup tupperware. Yes, the Earl of Tupper he Uh he has a patent um call it. Well had he didn't have it anymore. Uh. The e s tupper open mouth container and non snap type of closure. Therefore this by the way, Yeah, that's why I read it like that. But I was explaining that to the everybody else. Do they know me? This is going poorly? No, it's not so. Um. Let's you want to talk a little bit about Tupper himself. Yeah. He Um was a bit of a reclusive figure, as we'll find, but he was also like a he was a pretty sharp guy. I A grouch, I think is a possible way to describe him. Maybe a bit of a mad, smart, tinkering grouch. Um. He disliked his father because he felt his father lacked ambition. And this is when he was like ten. Right, Um, all you do is just go to the races and lay around het. Well, his parents owned a like a farm of sorts, but I think I get the idea. It was like kind of a harvest your own farm. And this kid, little Earl Tupper, when he was like ten twelve, he was like pitching the idea to to build like a children's playground on the grounds of his pick your own farm for you know, to at track tourists and stuff. And his I was like, it sounds like a lot of work, totally, just go to school or something. Get out of my hair. And Arrow was like, you're gonna pay for ignoring me. But he he was of sharp contrast to his father, is what I'm trying to say. He was very ambitious. Big Tinker came up with a lot of different patent ideas and apparently patents too. Yeah he Uh he had a book of inventions. Uh. There was a better stocking guarter, which is a very sexy thing for a child to admit, right. Um, A better way to remove a burst appendix. Yeah, yeah, that's for real. Um, a dagger shaped comb to be clipped to the belt. Um pants that wouldn't lose their crease. Um. This one of great import. Yeah, the customized cigarettes, I can't believe that didn't catch on, like for real, you know how Coca Cola does this stupid cans and bottles now with names. Oh now I understand. Yeah, there were cigarettes that said like Sporty or the collegiate on the cigarette, so it would have like your sports team like emblazoned on the side. Maybe the problem is none of these inventions took off. Now this guy literally well he could give his inventions away, but like he almost literally couldn't give him give them away. He he ended up manufacturing these things and giving them away is like premiums for other stuff like cigarettes and things like that. Yeah. So, um, he starts a tree uh doctor business, Tupper Tree Doctors that um failed after um the depression, people were cutting back on things like tree doctoring. So he went out of business and in a very fortuitous move, went and worked um for Visca Lloyd Plant, which is a division of DuPont making plastics. Right, and this is where things kind of started taking shape. Yes, yes, yes, so basically he gets into plastics and this town in Massachusetts that he ended up in where the Vistalloid plant was, he was all over New England basically growing up right, this particular town was kind of like a mad scientists mecca where like all of this stuff is going on in plastics, all these little tiny plastic manufacturing outfits are, you know, start It's like a startup town for plastics in like the thirties or forties. They're like, we have this new thing, Like what all can we do with it? Yeah? And which, by the way, plastic, especially polyethylene. Polyethylene was invented by accident, and by the forties they had still kind of they perfected the polyethylene or had come out perfect, but they hadn't figured out quite how to use it. And Earl Tupper was one of those guys in the forties on the cutting edge of taking plastics and figuring out how to mold them in the right shape, how to keep him from being oily or sticky or falling apart when they were sitting out in the sunlight or all this stuff. This guy is doing all these tests and he ends up coming up thanks to getting a block of this pure polyethylene from DuPont, the good stuff, the good stuff, uncut stuff, um, and he figures out how to make this bowl, A wonder lier bowl is what he calls it. Yeah, and um DuPont at the time didn't think that they could even mold plastic. Like he was smarter than their guys because he figured out how to do it. And Um then along with the design the the patented U tupperware seal that made it so useful and famous, that made the what sound that made the like the burping sound or tooting sound. Um he originally got that idea for the seal from paint cans, apparently, the fact that you could turn a paint can upside down and it wouldn't leak paint out all over the place. And he said, I guess we can do this with food, you know, Yeah, like put food in here. It's sealed. Look at the demonstration. It's upside down and I'm shaking it and there's none of that gravy coming out. What right, the grave is not coming out. I can drop this bowl and it's not gonna break because everyone knows how clumsy housewives are breaking stuff all over And the fact that it, um is that you burp it right, and it makes that sound, and you're basically preserving the food for many many days to come which was huge because a lot of the people who were um homemakers in the forties and fifties, they had lived through the depression and they remembered exactly what it was like. So preserving food was a big deal. And so this thing was like it's really easy to take for granted these days, but it was very cutting edge technology. Well, these days they have all those terrible cheap oh uh, I was gonna say knockoffs are not knockoffs are major brands. But you know those little cheap plastic containers that are sold, they're they're not nearly the quality of Tupperware. No tupper Warres started all that. Yeah, and this stuff is garbage. The lids don't fit right ever, they break, they don't, they don't do any thing that Tupperware did. Like I have a Wonder bowl from the nineteen seventies that's still like perfect. I mean it's a little worn down, but it's still like functions perfectly right. Well, it's a testament to and that other garbage that stuff, like I don't have anything from last year. Well, it's made and it was made during a time of much more disposable thinking. You know, at the time it was like, we're gonna make something now will last forever. Yeah, and I think they still have a lifetime guarantees on everything. Yeah. Like you could send in a tupperware piece from the sixties and they'll, you know, if it's broken and it meets the requirements, like you know, you didn't smash it with a hammer or something. Um, because they can't prove you, they'll give you like credits or the equivalent of what you could get today or something. It's like, well, you paid for that, but like, let's see what the West Aid currency calculator has to say about that. So, um, he formed Upper Plastics. Uh. Thing did not take off though, um like he thought they would. He put him in department stores and hardware stores for some reason, not a good place to sell your tupperware. Yeah. I mean nowadays I can see that, but back then you probably just went to hardware stores for nails and hammers and stuff. Yeah, I'm sure there are home goods and stuff too. It was probably closer to a general store in the hardware stores today, but even still, they weren't flying off the shelves at the point. They were not. Um. So what he did was there was another timeline going on at the same time. UM Stanley Home Products was this, uh basically pioneered the non door to door sales in favor of hosting a party for lack of a better word, in home demonstrations where you would gather people together. And it was a guy named Norman Squires had um garnered a lot of profits in this kind of sales, and they had working for them a woman named Brownie Wise and she was selling all kinds of stuff for Stanley Home Products and uh they called it the hostess group demonstration plan and she was a great, great salesperson. Yeah. So these people at Stanley Home Products basically found tupperware on their own and started selling it at these hostess parties. Right. Yeah, she formed her own company called Tupperware Patio Parties. Oh did she yea before she was hired. Before she was hired, And she was selling so much of it that Earl Tupper got in touch with her and was like, I can't sell this stuff in stores like you're beating like department stores in New York City sales records, and she yeah, she really was. She had a lot of charms. She had um she figured out that this burp thing that was so essential and made this product so revolutionary, right that, Um, it wasn't like intuitive, you didn't just understand how to work it, and so it wasn't helping sale, which again seems weird today, but back then people like, what is this weird colored thing? Just go together? And they're just banging them together in the isle of a hardware store crying. Um. They She figured out that if you demonstrate this to people, especially in like somebody's house or whatever and they've had a couple of martinis and there's or Derv's, people are apt to buy these things. And yeah, like you said, she started out selling department stores hardware stores obviously, um, and she got hired on by Earl Tupper. She was in Detroit at the time. I think I think she'd moved down to Orlando when she was hired. Oh really by that point. Yeah, she was from Beauford, Georgia originally. Yeah, she was from Earl Georgia. And U ended up, um being married and divorced, which was pretty unusual at the time. And she was a single mom. Yep, the little Jerry Wise that's right. She unfortunately her husband was a violent drunk that too, so that's not saying that. That's PBS taken the fall for that. So she was re married him for about six years and then it was basically like, I'm gonna make my own way. He only had an eighth grade education, and she was killing it on the sales front. Yeah, she she really was. So it took before we get any further about Brownie Wise. Great name name, yeah, maybe not a band name, but a great name. The brown the Brownie Wise would be a good name, or the the Brownie Wise massacre Yeah sure, yeah, there you go, or Brownie Wise over Drive. Both of those anyway for one another. I guess the point that I'm trying to get to his Let's take your break, Okay. So Brownie Wise has her tupper Wear Patio Parties company out selling stores. She gets hired on UM. They literally divide the company into uh two sides, the Tupperware manufacturing up in Massachusetts and then Tupperware Home Parties down in Orlando. Down in Orlando, yeah, where she lives. Basically, Earl Tupper comes to her in n and says, hey, how would you like to be one of like three female high level executives in the United States in the world I would guess, and she said, that's sure, why not, I'll do you a favor. And I said she was a very interesting woman. If I didn't, I did in my head and meant to say it, but she, Um, there's apparently a movie coming out about her life, starring Sandra Bullock. You did not say that, and I did see that, So there you go. I couldn't find any information on except that I think it's in uh in pre uh pre production right now. Oh, I see, I think it's going to happen. But um, yeah, I mean she she's one of the great uh woman entrepreneurs that this country has ever seen, the world has ever seen. Really yea, because she took this tupperware, which everyone except the American public agreed was great. In ninety seven, the year that Tupper invented this stuff, Time named it this amazing thing. It won design Awards. Yeah, she was on the first woman on the cover of Business Week magazine, right right. But even before she came along, everybody, especially in the art world, in the design world, um said this, this, this stuff is great. But it was just sitting there languishing, and then then Brownie Wise comes along and just turns it into a blockbuster, like turns it into it an American iconic brand, which it still is today. Yeah. And what she realized, which is uh was a stroke of genius, was it's the nineteen fifties. The suburbs are happening post World War two in a big way. Um, there's a lot of women that are that are homemakers, that are I guess we could just say they were bored and looking for something to do well. Plus also they had very um, they had very real constrictions on their time where like they're basically freedom of movement. They didn't have cars, they didn't have things like this, they didn't have a lot of ways to make money. Yeah. Well, and again they were out in the suburbs for the first time. It's not like many of these were connected by subway or anything. That was still an inner city deal. Right. So, But rather than view these places as fast like waste lands of isolation, Brownie Wise said, no, these are like little tiny social networks where people know and trust one another and they're board out of their skulls and they're looking for ways to make money. Like so, not only do you have a really great market to sell this to, you have a really great workforce that's just sitting there, idol. And she said, how would you gals like to sell tupperware? And they went, let's do this, that's right. And what she did was came up with a system where and you could work your way up the chain, um, from sales all the way. Well, let's let's just detail it. What you are is your consultant at first, which is out there, you know, holding the parties, hosting these parties. Talk about everybody's till yeah, and then you can work your up to manager if you organize a certain number of parties, and then managers, uh, we're eventually recruiting other women. So if you recruit enough women and increased sales, then you could rise to distributor. And that was the highest level you could attain at that point. Yes, you could be a distributor. You have your own office, you have your network of managers, and then they managed the consultants or the party throwers, party hosts, and um. Basically she started her own army of salespeople. Yeah, so incentibized salespeople. Right now, there are two point nine million people in the world. Every three seconds there's another top waur party. But we're getting ahead of ourselves, right, So she she put together this workforce and again it was UM, this guy named Norman Squires who came up with this idea that led to UM being a huge, huge hip for tupperware, but also later on avon Um and Mary Kay and Pampered Chef and like all of these, all of these brands that like are sold through hostess parties basically get you in our house and get you drunk and just leave me a blank Checkly, but the it wasn't invented by Brownie wise, but she definitely perfected it for sure. So UM she tapped this workforce. And one of the ways that she kept people excited and loyal not just the fact that they could rise throughout this hierarchy UM in the tupperware industry, but there there was also like this thing that she created called the Jubilee every year down Orlando. It was a big company party it was, and they would just pull out all the stops like they would bury fur coats. They were bury blenders. One of the buyers once said that he bought a hundred thousand blenders once for this jubilee. They just bring all these tupperware sales associates and just basically throw them a party for a few days and let them just win free stuff and have a great time. Yeah. And when you say, Barry, I think we should explains that sounds really weird. They would bury these prizes and people would go and dig them up. Right. It wasn't like you can't have this. Look at what you can't have, we're burying it. They just sounded fun. You're like, they bury for coats, they bury anything that moves. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, but it was all part of the fun. Apparently they lost a lot of them too. Yeah. Years later, Um, at the at the Tupperware headquarters in ORLEANSO, they went to dig a pond and they found a bunch of the prizes that had never been found. Yes, some say there's still for coats buried all over Orlando by the illuminati. Right. So, um, those are the big jubilee parties, the big company parties. Great for morale. Um. The hostess uh themselves or the consultants would um, they would make percentage. Uh, they basically make a cut what they were able to sell as well as get prizes. Um, like these really neat prizes and the more parties you hosted, the better the prizes would get. So it's like it's like the Wild West. It's the Heyday for these women. They're like earning their own money for a change. They're getting these great prizes. They're feeling great about themselves. They're not bored any longer. And their husbands were like, WHOA, what's going on here? Give me that money you made? Yeah, exactly. And things were so successful with this model that that was their only sales model up until the late nineteen eighties. Right, You couldn't even buy the stuff in stores. No, he just stopped. It wasn't even worth the money or effort to distribute it. The stories. They just did it through parties and home parties. Thank you, Brownie Wise all right, So, um, and like you said in they started selling it through um catalogs, I guess, uh, yeah, I think they. I've seen like older catalogs from like the fifties and sixties, So I don't know what that means. Maybe over the phone you saw Tupperware one. Yeah, it's on our it's on the podcast pitch for this episode. There's a link to this kind of design layout and it has some catalogs. So it must have been like ordered by phone. Oh yeah, maybe so. And then just about ten years later, Tupperware had their first website, which e commerce in that was fairly forward thinking. Yeah that's true, you know. Yeah, um, so this caught like wildfire today you can it's not just like an American institution. There are Tupperware parties, like we said, at the rate of one every three seconds, and more than a hundred countries around the world. I had no idea that Tupperware was that popular in like Asia and India, And they said half a million, more than half a million every year in France alone. Yeah, of Tupperware sales are outside of the US these days. Yeah, and it's a I mean, like it's got it moving like gangbusters. Last I saw, I was trading at like sixty three dollars a share, which is down from like a hundred in December. Maybe. Um, Like it's it's a really set company again these days, Like it's been able to just be on the brink of utter irrelevance when it finds a new market, when it figures out a new way to do to sell, when it figures out a new product, like currently right now in China. Um, Tupperware is making tons of cash selling a thousand dollar water filter, and they're doing it by traveling from town to town and setting up these in home demonstrations or public demonstrations and showing how to do it. So they're like taking the Tupperware model that Brownie Wise like really perfected and and figuring out how it best works and cultures around the world. Yeah, I know. They make um also, like uh, depending on your country and what they eat, like certain shaped um containers, right like round bread containers for non in India. How about that? So what happened to Brownie Wise? I guess she retired, was thanked, carried out on everyone shoulders, and lived a great fulfilled life until her death. Right. Well, we're gonna tell you right after this break, all right, Josh, let's fast forward to um. The Tupperware business is booming, Brownie Wise is a bit of a celebrity. The twist is going like Gangbusters? Was it? Probably okay? People are still twisting the night away? Yeah? I mean what was that like? Probably started three years? Sure there was some squares still twisting. Yeah, they weren't doing the mashed potato yet. No, I think that was a little later, Okay, Um, so business is booming, Brownie Wise is killing it. She's a celebrity. Earl Tupper um starts to get little jealous over the years. It's as simple as that. Yeah. As much as he like didn't seek or want the limelight, he was still jealous that Brownie Wise people thought that she was Tupperware and that she started the company um and started selling like I can sell anything like this. So she didn't say that him in the media said she could. She could have done this with any brand. She's that great, and Earl Tupper wanted to be like, well, no, I mean my product that I invented is you know a big part of this, if not the thing, Earl Tupper right, so he um he apparently also she stopped kind of cow towing to him quite as much. Um, but I got on great for a while. Yeah. And again he had said to their PR department and to any media interviewer like, yes, this lady is the face of Tupperware. Treater is such, promoter, is such, And he, just like you said, ended up getting jealous. Didn't like that she wasn't cows outing to him any longer, and in night said, you're fired. Yeah. He The story I read was that he wanted to sell the company and cash in, and that he didn't think and was advised that it would be really hard to sell a company with a woman in such a prominent position on the board. And so he, uh, like you said, just unceremoniously get rid of her, gave her one year salary. It was like thirty grands zero stock that she had built almost from the ground up. Yeah, or help build at least. And I gotta say that was her you know, that was her mistake. She should have gotten some stock along the way. Yeah, I guess. You know, she's too busy selling And yeah, I mean exactly. She was imagined thirty five grand a year was a pretty good salary at the point. You want me to look it up, I will, you can. So she got that small pay out. She went UM and what he said to her was is that there were some accounting errors in the previous year. She wouldn't come to Massachusetts to talk to him about it, and sort of dug In says that she said that she had gotten sicker, injured and couldn't leave Florida. He finally went down to Florida UM and basically said that, you know, these jubilees are too expensive. The landscaping you've done here in Florida, the company headquarters is too expensive. You're spending too much money on clothes. Uh. And we own all that stuff, We own all your clothing. What well, I mean that's I don't know if he actually took it, but he basically was like, you know, she paid for all that stuff through the company, as she should have, you know, to keep up appearances. But um, yeah, that was it for her. She started a small company called Cinderella Cosmetics that folded after a year and sort of faded into obscurity. Then um earl tupper Uh sold out that the next year I think sixteen million. Yeah, he sells out for sixteen million dollars. Nice cash. She wrecked all drug company, which was eventually absorbed by Kraft, who apparently now owns Tupperware. I think maybe it's the parent company. Um and yeah, sixteen million in nineteen fifty eight. It's not too bad for a boy who couldn't get his parents to build a playground on the family pick your own whatever farm. Did you find out if she thirty five grand was a good salary? Yeah? It wasn't bad. It was like two hundred and I think thirty two thousand dollars back then. Yeah, that's good. It's not bad. I mean especially for a executive. Yeah. Um. But he sold the whole thing for sixteen million, gave her one year salary, moved to Costa Rica, bought an island, announced as US citizenships so they didn't have to pay any taxes on that. Got divorced. Yeah right, and uh said Siona, everybody, I'm going to Costa Rica to buy an island and keep a note pad in my pocket. So anytime an idea for a new invention hits, I'll have it. Yeah. And just like probably you know, eight pineapples on his island. Yeah. He died in three in Costa Rica, Uh, seventy six, and she died in nineteen and Um, tupperware has not gone out of fashion. It's it's been featured uh starting in what year was it, I guess when they first came out at the Museum of Modern Art, and then again in two thousand eleven. I think I even saw this exhibit. In fact, I'm almost positive I did, because it was about just industrial design and things, and there's Tupperware all over again because of its gorgeous of course, now you know that fifties era design. The original line that tupper released is called the Millionaire line, and it came in six colors, five pastels and one white, right, yellow, blue, green, orange, and pink. And they're really pretty. Like if you look at a set of these things in a good, good condition, they're gorgeous. He went on to the Plastics Hall of Fame. Um and now like this stuff from the fifties and sixties, you can get some decent money on eBay for that stuff, you know, because it still works and people love that retro look. Did you know that he refused refused to have any um any pet bowls designed. He thought it was Tupperware was too good for pets to eat out of. What a jerk. See, I was all on board until that. Actually I wasn't on board. I was off board when I found out that he fired Brownie Wise. Yeah he and then was like, okay, I've got some money. See a later family. Yeah, moved to Costa Rica. Would you be funny if he went down and started a cult with the slinky guy. Um? So Tupperware stayed pretty much the same until when they designer named Morrison Cousins basically kind of redesigned for for the new era. Yeah he he was UM already a VP I guess that Tupperware and he was. He decided that it was a little difficult. He had an eighty two or eighty one year old mother at the time eighty seven year old mother at the time when he was charged with redesigning the Tupperware line, and UM he from that viewpoint, he redesigned it to make it easier for UM the aged to use. Right, So like that burping lid that you had to like really kind of have some decent hand strength to put on. He figured out a way around it by UM using flaps that opened and closed to release the air. Didn't require quite as much hand strength. UM. The lids were made in contrast and closure to the bowls, so if you had a low visibility low vision not visibility, that's totally different. If you were wearing all camouflage at the time, you'd be able to find the lid and the bowl that go together pretty easy. So he yea, he made them easier for old books, yep. And he was the guy who UM brought it online. He did a lot of good stuff. Apparently with it, he also took the brand. I thought this is cool, and I would love to see this on video because I'll bet it's just so bizarre and surreal to watch. They broadcast a series of live Tupperware parties on some home shopping channel in the early nineties. That was probably the first home shopping experience. I think those were around in the eighties. I think home shopping was already established. When did they do this early nineties? Oh? I thought you said he did it like in the sixties. No, no, no, got no, we should do one on home shopping. I'll bet that has an interesting, weird history. You think I'll look into you know? Okay, my mom's into it, man. QBC. So did we talk about how to throw a tupperware party? We did? We sure did. Okay, did we talk about tupperware drag parties? We did not. We should because there's more than one. There's well, there's one person in particular, a guy named Chris Anderson, who performs in drag as Dixie Longate and um sells like a million dollars worth of tupperware in the process. Like he gets paid to perform like you gotta pay forty bucks just to a person just to have I guess he stole does house parties, but he literally does like tours and does like off Broadway shows and stuff now right, But the whole thing is I mean real tupperware party where like you can buy tupperware, and like he's demonstrating the tupperware. He's kind of giving his own take on what it's useful for. But he's not the only um drag show in the country selling tupperware, of course, not apparently. Uh. A drag queen named Aunt Barbara up in Long Island is was at least in two twelve the number one salesperson in North America for tupperware. It all makes sense when you think about it. So two d and fifty grand worth of tupperware in one year. Like the kitch of the drag show the kitch of tupperware parties, it all sort of goes hand in hand. Yes, it does. And um I went to the website of Dixie Longate and he has a pretty interesting bio. I have three kids, Winona, Dwayne and Absorbing Junior. It's all made up, I think, I think maybe, although you never know, but yeah, now he has solo stand up shows, um and a recent theatrical show called Never Wear a Tube Top while Riding a Mechanical bowl and sixteen other things I learned while I was drinking last Thursday. And apparently that is selling out venues. It's basically that's selling out venues. We're not, but that is don't be better. We will one day if we didn't dragging. Probably. Well, no, that's not true either, one day chuck. Yeah. Uh wow, that's a weird way to end us. Yeah, I think it's perfect. Um. I thought I had something else, but I guess I don't. Oh, yes I do. PBS did a great documentary called Tupperware with an exclamation point. It's got a whole website on online and you can watch parts of the documentary, if not the whole thing. Yeah, and look for the Sandra Bullock the Brownie Wise story coming to a theater near you in a couple of years. Nice job, you said a theater near you. A theater you just said coming to a theater near you. That's like, Wow, did you ever think you would grow up to say that like in public? Sure? Okay, Well, if you want to know more about tupper war. You can type that one word and the search part how stuff works dot com? And uh, since I said search parts time for listener mail. And they call this the Strisand effect. Have you ever heard of this? No, Hello, Josh, Chuck and Jerry really enjoyed the podcast on Internet censorship, although I was disturbed that s OP three oh three exists. Sure, one thing not mentioned that I thought was relevant is when individuals attempt to censor specific things from their own life and the resulting fallout that occurs. In two thousand three, and I remember what was happening. Actually, a picture of Barbra Streisand's home in Malibu appeared in a publicly available collection of over twelve thousand photos of California coastline. The collection was documenting coastal erosion and not related to news paparazzi or tabloids or anything like that. But Streisand's lawyers filed a fifty million dollar lawsuit against the photographer, asking the picture to be taken down for privacy reasons. Before stories of the lawsuit hit the press, the photo of the home had only been downloaded six times, two of which were by her attorneys. During the following month. After the whole thing became a news story. More than four hundred thousand people visited the website. Uh, they even coined the term the streisand effect were an attempt to hand for her. Yeah it did. I remember this blew up in her face. An attempt at censoring or removing something from the Internet results and said thing being seen and reported on much more than if the person requesting it be removed it simply let it fade into obscurity.
