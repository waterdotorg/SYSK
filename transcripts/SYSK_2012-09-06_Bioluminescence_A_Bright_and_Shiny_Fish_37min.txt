Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know? From House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuff Bryant and uh. You put us together and you get a little something called Stuff you Should Know. And that's what this is. Whether you like it or not, you have to listen to it. It's try. Um. Actually, no one has to listen to this. It's part of both Obama's and Romney's platforms. Yeah, it's a part of Obamacare. You gotta listen to Stuff you Should Know, and you gotta get an r f D chip in your hand, and you have to give poor people all your money. None of that is true, that you have to listen to the podcast and the porpulal part um. Chuck, how's it going? It's great. Are you feeling sick? Do you need any kind of here Obama or otherwise? Now? Are you feeling sick? I'm fine. Chance, like my shoulder muscles are gonna pop right out of my skin. I went to that foot massage play some Buford Highway the other day. You ever been there. M hm. Treat your feet Is that what it's called. Yeah, that's a great name. They'll they'll do an hour on your feet for bucks if that's what you desire. Oh yeah, I know. About a little bit bit into it, they'll ask you like, would you want to go half and half, like half body half foot, because basically they get you in there, they're going at your feet and you're like, you know, I don't know if I could do an hour on my feet. Each toe has gotten their own massage at this point, like they're just jelly cracked your toes. Yeah, so they think, yeah, you know, i'll pay another twenty bucks for the body, right they give you t it's really nice. You should go. It does sound nice, but it's not like private. Like you're in a big room with like fifteen recliners. Everyone's just sitting around and well we've gotten backrubs at the mall before. Yeah, that's true. You remember, I don't know how I got on this Treat your feet Buford Highway. Go eat some fun and then go get your foot massage. Where's good fun around here? We're trying to figure that out. The Yeah, where uh if you are we going to do this now. Okay, I like fun number two, um, which is past Claremont. Um, it's in a little shopping center. Just look it up, okay, I mean it's it's all good, all good fun. Um. Yeah. I don't know how we got on there, but some places on Beaureford Highway. Oh you use some money, seriously, at least some free fun. Um. This has nothing to do with bioluminescence. No, it doesn't. Although sometimes if you stir your funt around, chuck, you're gonna see some um fungus possibly rise to the top a couple of times. Right, Yeah, that's a good one too. And um, where those things still alive and not cooked, they possibly might glow. And where they to glow, you would say, look at those things, they're bioluminescing. That's right, because that's what they do. It is a life form that generates their own glow inside their body, their own life. Yeah, pretty awesome. And um, you I read a different um study It was like, what what's the deal with this? Because this is still very much a mystery. Um, we have an idea of how this goes down, but not in every case. We also don't understand why in a lot of cases, um, and in in some cases we don't understand how. And the thing is is, I don't think it's that it's out of the grasp of science to understand it. I think that when researchers are looking into this, they just they become so transfixed on the beautiful glow that they forget what they're doing and waste tons of time. And then all of a sudden, you're like, oh, I gotta publish our Paris. And then it's just like they just write why on a piece of paper and send it in, as Tracy Wilson of Pop Stuff Great Podcast points out, and Tracy's articles are always awesome. Yeah, oh man, they're comprehensive. You know, I never have to worry about it. Um. Sadly, sometimes scientists can either harm the light making magic when they try to study them, this makes it hard to study, or the animal will exhaust it's light making glow capabilities out of like fear or defense or spite or spite, which will also make it hard to study. So those are a couple of reasons, and the whole just why right. So, Um, we do have a pretty good handle to some extent, But let's talk about what luminescence itself is right with that this light bulb right here in this a key of brand lamp um. It's incandescent. It's an incandescent light bulb. I think this is an edison bulb is oh? Is it like the real old amy looking one sort of um? So that is pretty simple. It has electricity that passes through a filment, just a thin metal piece of something metal, and that heats up, and it heats up so much that it gives off light, which is incredibly inefficient. And if say a jellyfish for to do this, it would catch fire even though it's under water. Right, So what um living organisms do when they want to give off light is something called cold light or bioluminescence, which is the combination of chemicals that produce light like a glow stick, but no heat. But it is just like a glow stick. You're combining two things that will make a glow exactly, except you don't have to shake up the jellyfish. They do not like that. Or it's like the glow sticks that I used to sell very often at Stone Mountain Laser Show. It's like the glows free Summer that I used to dance with at races. You were at raves and I was selling these things during like Lee Greenwoods, Lee Greenwood, Lee Green Would you Proud to be an American? Yeah? Boy, I heard that song five thousand times. So bad. Anyone who's never been to a Stone Mountain, Georgia. They have a big rock there and they have a laser show on it during the summer. It's a big rock that has a basically the Confederate heroes carved into the side of it by the guy who did Mount Rushmore. How's that the same guy? Huh? Yeah, And they show a very corny laser show every summer since like the early nineteen eighties, and not just once this summer, like every night during the summer. Yeah, that's why I've heard it ten thousand times. It's something And Chuck, you still work there. I think you left that out selling gloves sticks sticks full circle. Yes, all right, let's quit stalling. Let's talk about bioluminescence. Okay, that's all over the place. Uh. Like you said, we don't know exactly how it works in all cases, but we do know that these animals do mix together. There are different substances, just like a glow stick, wood and to turn their little glow on and off. Um. Here on the planet, not in the ocean, because that's where most of the stuff takes place here on planet Earth. On the dry land. Uh, you can have things glowing like fox fire, which is this fungus that feeds on rotting wood. You look at pictures of fox fire. Pretty cool. Yeah, doesn't look real, but it's real. It's very real. Um. The jack O lander mushroom you can google that as well. That's my favorite bioluminous in organism. Why just because it's the South on land on Terra Firma, because it's a perfectly named thing, the jack O lantern mushroom. Like it has that glow coming through the gills, um, and just the gills, so it looks like there's like this glow coming inside and there's like holes where it's coming out of. It's so neat. My favorite on Terra Firma is the lightning bug a k a. The firefly. Here in the South and I guess I'm not sure where else it on lightning bugs, but definitely in the Sound. You'll see them come out every summer and if you're a little kid, you can go around and catch them. And put them in a jar and then and then release them. And in fact you may be harming them just by catching them. But what you don't want to do if you're a kid is like smash these things because it's just yeah, that means you're gonna end up being a serial killer one day probably. Uh. So the firefly is uh, you know you generally you think of them as the adults lying around, but their little larva can glow as well on the ground, right, And a lot of people call um firefly lava glow worms, but glow worms are apparently another kind of fly larvae. Fireflies are fireflies or lightning bugs. That's right, um, centipedes, millipedes, there's all all kinds of little things that can glow worms. Uh, there's some worms that give off a bioluminescent sludge and no one has any idea why is it their poop and then pop it? I don't think so. Ober. The the the secretion they produce when they're mating and all that, it's probably like that. It probably comes from the ring. I can't remember the name of the ring. So that's on Earth. But if you really want to get down to some cool, glowing creatures. You need to dive down into the ocean to the twilight zone, which I think we've talked about that, haven't we know? We talked about it in biospeleiol in caves. Yeah, there's different zones of light penetration in caves and in the ocean too, that's right. Um, the twilight zone is generally about six hundred sixty two feet deep. Six It depends because obviously different kinds of ocean water are gonna allow different amounts of light in. It depends on what the ocean floor looks like, but it is, um, it is the dysphotic or poorly lit zone deeper than the euphotic sunlit zone or good zone or shout or then the aphotic midnight zone, which is like scary no light. That's a scary time down there, right. Those are the things down there that have like no eyes, right, because there's no reason, same like with the caves. So um, yeah, I remember what was the Prometheus Salaman just three ft long and doesn't have eyes. The scariest thing ever except for the cigar shark, which will actually get do in here. Okay, so is that the cookie cutter shark man that things frightening um. So in this uh, this twilight zone, the desphotic zone or mezo pelagic zone, mesopelagic zone, stop laughing at me. Uh there, this is where most of the bioluminescent organisms on Earth can be found. And the light that penetrates this area um is a blue green color because the red, yellow, orange. Yeah, the red, yellow and orange are absorbed by the seawater above and the violet is scattered, so the blue and the green are the ones that get through. So everything's just kind of color blue green. That's what the sunlight is. So most of the bioluminescent organisms in this um dysphotic zone, dysphotic zone have evolved to produce light at that same wavelength from something like four four hundred seventy nanometers, which is like the blue green spectrum. That's right, So matches that sunlight, yeah, which is pretty cool. Yeah, well we'll get to it. But it can lead to some cool things like camouflage. So uh, the but it also means that it travels farther. Light travels that that type of light travels the farthest and water because it has a shorter wavelength than the other types. So an animal producing this could really cook down there basically. Yeah. Uh, we're talking jellyfish, shrimp, grill, squid, other kinds of fish, marine worms, whatever the heck that is therely what you think it is. Yeah, what are those one worms called? It like come up out of the little tubes tube worms? Oh yeah, yeah, I believe that's what they're called. Um, either that or it just made some terrible like sixth grade joke. But um. They they they are like on the ocean bottom and they they have they just come out of these tubes and grab stuff and go back in there like three ft long. You've not seen this sea snake to me. Yeah, but they're I think they're attached or they may be attached to their tubes, or they just never come all the way out. I'm gonna have to look into that. Yeah. Uh so you talked about the blue green light is what they generally produce. Um, there is something called the loose jawfish, which actually can make red light very deep in the ocean. But that's really unusual that can make red light, and it's um. A lot of species can't even see the color red down there because I don't know if they're just their brains aren't used to it because they never see it. So the loose jaw uses this thing um to to basically sneak up on people. Um, it's like Jane Gum at the end of silence of the lamb and and like the fish are like Jodie Foster like, and Jane Gum is the loose jaw fish coming up behind her like I can see you, you can't see me. So, like we said earlier, we don't know for sure why all these uh, bioluminescent forms of life are down there doing their thing. Um. You did mention the earthworm that has the secretion. They don't know why they do that. The mushroom spores, they think that maybe it's um to attract insect to spread these spores. That's why the mushroom glows makes sense. Um Sometimes and this one's kind of cute. Sometimes animals will light up when something nearby them lights up, which I think might just be a little like, hey, how you doing, I can glow too, Well, that's how far a fliers are doing. Yeah, they're attracting mates right with it, like a very specific pattern right there. They used it to communicate like, hey, you're looking pretty good. Meet you by the fence post, right, yeah, um, let's go get some fun. So should we talk about the dino flagellates, the dino flagellates, dino flagelates? Am I pronouncing it wrong? No? I think that was wrong? Okay, well yeah, So have you ever seen Apolar thirteen? Yeah? You remember the part where um they had a problem. Is it Tom level? Gym level? Where gym level? And UH is hanging out with Bill Paxton and they're talking about how they're just shooting the breeze while they're trying to stay alive, and um he talks about how he was flying a mission, um coming in on an aircraft carrier, and there was a blackout and he couldn't see where he's going, he couldn't find the aircraft carry to land. He's running low and fuel. Then all of a sudden he looks and he notices that there's a bunch of um he calls it like glowing algae or whatever. But what he's talking about where dino flagelets that were kicked up by the wake of the aircraft carrier and he used them as like a runway to guide them in. I remember that part. That's a great part that whole movie from like start to finish with. But these dino flagelets create what's called the milky sea when you get enough of them together, when they're disturbed physically, they start to glow. And if you have a bunch of them, you can see him from space. Actually in this article there's a picture of a pretty substantial milky sea off the coast of Africa. Pretty cool stuff. And if you google milky Sea two you can see some like that's cool looking. But I like the shots from like low flying planes, helicopters and uh a little eerie. Yeah, that may say. So. They have no idea again, why dino flagelates would glow when they're disturbed. Obviously they're like trying to register their complaint. They can't talk, you can't flip anyone off, so they glow out of anger. Apparently, Um, they they there's a theory called the burglar alarm theory. I like this one. Or basically they think that, um, when dino flage lets start to glow, it's because there's little fish eating on them, right, which is disturbing. They think that maybe they glow to basically alert larger fish that will come eat the smaller fish so they'll stop eating the dino flagelets. That there's little fish in the area. Pretty awesome, Like hey, help come eat this guy because you're bigger. Uh. Here's some other and you know, these are the ones that are the most understood because there is a lot of uncertainty, Like we said, like ten times um. But here's here's some of the reasons that they think they're doing this communication, which we've mentioned with the firefly or the lightning bug. Uh, to locate food, maybe to use it as an actual light to see in the dark. Pretty cool, or a spotlight to catch prey, oh like temporarily blind something gotcha? Or no, to like go find it. It's very dark in here. I need to see what fish are around to attract prey, like the anglerfish, Like look at this bright glow, come here, chomp. Yeah. I love that one. What was that in Finding Nemo Man? The thing was scary. I didn't see that movie, good one, Camouflage. I don't watch any of those anymore because Emily doesn't like him. Oh, yes, she doesn't like Disney movies. She doesn't like any of those Pixar movies because it's always like some tragedy like someone dies in its heartbreak and keep her away from toy story three. Dude, I can't even watch that movie. I made her watch up and she was just like a like a little blob of play the first ten minutes or this so sad. God. But I always explained to her, like, this is why they make these movies, so kids can learn how to cope with death. And then they see like it's all happy afterwards, you know, all right, camouflage this is the cool this one, yeah, and the it's pretty. It makes sense too. If you're in the ocean, and if you ever like swum down ten or fift ft and looked up open your eyes in the ocean, I've done it. Um. It's it's hard to see stuff below you, but it's easy to look up because you know the sunlight's penetrating down and see like the silhouette or in the case of Jaws, you see like the silhouette of the lady's legs on the raft. You know, that's good eating. Um. If you have, like in the case of what's it called counter elimination, you can actually produce spots on your underside to make it more difficult for a fish beneath you, a predator beneath you to look up and like make out what's going on, Like, you won't have the the the perfect little silhouette outline of a yummy fish. It'll confuse it, basically because you're cutting down in the contrast pretty cool, like you're creating light that blends in with that same blue green light, and all of a sudden you disappear well or just breaks up your shapes don't look like you should. Um. And then there's the opposite, the cookie cutter or cigar shark, which is the name I think you made up, Um, that's real, which basically has the reverse of that, where the bottom, the underside of the cookie cutter shark glows except for this one spot in the middle that is dark that looks like a small fish, So of shark or some other animal looking up, we'll be like, I'm gonna go eat that fish. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh god, it's a cookie cutter slash cigar shark. And then the cookie cutter shark takes a bite out of them, round bite and that's why they call it the cookie cutter. It's like a little plug of flesh and if you've ever seen google these dudes in their face, it's like the most frightening little thing you've ever seen in your life. Yeah, they're pretty terrifying. And you'll see pictures of like a shark or a whale washed up on the shore with like hundreds of these little bite plugs taken out of them. Yeah, that's pretty awful. That's a that's a terrible way to go. Yeah, but good for you, cigar shark, because you're small and you're doing what you can. Tough world down there. It's wildly you know, it's diphotic, and then self defense is the last reason. Um And basically, like a squid may release inc to cloud your vision, some of these things can release a cloud of a glowing cloud two uh, basically make you sit back and put on pink Floyd and like chill out for a little while. Yeah, I looked it up. There's a shrimp. There's a type of shrimp that releases a bioluminescent cloud. And I couldn't get the name. I saw both fire breathing and vomiting shrimp for the common names. But yeah, it just puts it out. That's not what I would want order on the menu, the fried vomiting shrimp, uh, and make sure there's extra poop in the main vain. Um. So what's going on here? How? How is this magic happening? Well, just like we've mentioned with a light stick, and involves two different substances mixed together to produce this reaction. Um. And there can be all different kinds of kinds of chemicals. But depending on the on the fish or the being, the being, the life. Uh. The g one is a a lucifer in and that's the light producer, and the other is a lucif phrase and that is the enzyme that catalyzes it. So and those aren't specific things like you you wouldn't look at the chemical composition of something and be like, oh, that's lucifer in. Something can be a lucifer and it's a generic term for something that produces light or something that catalyzes the production of light, the lucifhrase. That is correct, And they will mix together and a lot of times the lucifer in is something called a photo protein and it needs an eye on a charged ion to get things going. That would be the lucifhrase. That's right, But in all cases there's some sort of trigger. Could be mechanical, could be chemical, could be neu logical startle. Yeah, it could be something they don't understand yet, but something triggers these two things to get together and make this reaction. And one thing that I didn't realize was the word Lucifer means lightbringer. Yeah, I never knew that. You mean, I um went on a little side tear last night trying to figure out why the devil would be named the light Bringer? Did you find out? It's a mystery. It's um Latin and it came years, like centuries after UM the Old Testament was originally written, and I can't remember what version, but it was basically like added on by the I guess the Romans maybe added it on, but it's because it's Latin and the original version was not written in Latin. Lightbringer, the light Bringer, the morning Star, that's another way to put it. They said, maybe it had to do with Venus, because Venus is like a false are, and so maybe Lucifer is a false angel, is what they're saying. But makes sense because the devil would always come in disguise. Maybe, Yeah, I think that's weak light Bringer. That's pretty specific like what is that. I bet there's some theologian that has the answer here. I want to hear it. Yeah, I would hard to find out about that one podcast at Discovery dot com if you know that answer. So, Um, you've got lucifer in, you've got luciphrase. Some of these chemical reactions require another substance, and a lot of times it's oxygen, right, So luciferen will come in in contact with an oxygen molecule and then the luciphrase comes along, and then you've got a bioluminescent glow, which is pretty cool. But they also think that that's one of the reasons I should say, that's one of the reasons why they think that bioluminescence is an accidental byproduct of regular old evolution and that originally um, like there's a lucifering called um ceiling terrazine. I believe it's how you pronounce it, uh, And it's an antioxidant. It goes around and tries to find like rogue, harmful free radicals oxygen derivatives right and get rid of them. Uh. And they think that this happened this was a process that was way way older than bioluminescence, and then along came some substance that became a lucifhrase, and then light was created, and then it was just a byproduct like heats, a byproduct of metabolism, right. Um. But they think also that over time this happened in like maybe it's going on inside of us right now and we're producing light, but we just don't know it, or it's just so weak that we wouldn't even possibly be able to detect it. But this happened enough times in animals in the ocean where suddenly ones could catch prey more easily because they could see better than other animals that weren't bioluminescing, And so it was selected in these skies, and now bioluminescence is its own trait rather than a byproduct of the antioxidant process. I bet you're right. Oh it's that's not me man. I think you just cooked this up. I wish that's better than why as far as research papers go, Yeah, throw a theory out there, see if it sticks, That's what I say. So the deal with these these animals is they either have all this stuff like in their body as part of them, or they have a little relationship with a bacteria, like producing bacteria that live in a light organ and this is pretty cool. Like some of these animals can pull this organ back into their body like it's always on. Sometimes they don't want to light to be on, so they'll pull it back in the body. Or they have a little something like a light uh an eyelid that they can just kind of close over the light, which is pretty amazing. Yeah, but it's always going. Yeah. And what the other thing with evolution is they think that because they don't see this as often in lakes because lakes are younger, then they think it maybe happened independently at different parts in the ocean. So I talked to Tracy about this, and it was a little hinky. She wrote this a long time because she couldn't quite remember what the point was. But the point was that they think that because the process of antioxidation is a normal thing, um, that the the conditions were right for bioluminescence to be selected naturally in some places, but it wouldn't in like a lake. So the the idea that this happened independently and spontaneously when needed through evolution is kind of backed up by the idea that you don't really see bioluminescence at the bottom of lakes because you don't need it. It all makes sense when you just peel the peel the little curtain back, don't it when you peel the glowing skin bag? What else you got? Anything else? You've seen glowing cats? Yeah? The Mayo Clinic likes to put jellyfish jeans in animals. The most the biggest one so far as a cat and make it glow because they're checking um disease. They're using it to mark the progression of diseases. But they made a glowing cat. It's pretty cool, now does the I gotta look this. It glows under a blue light, but it glows green, and it's like the cat glows green like it. I guess it's the hair the caratinate produces has some sort of fluorescent property to it, but it's it's not bioluminescent in it's fluorescent, and fluorescent is where you take light of one color and reflected back, absorb it and reflected back of it as a different color. You're not actually producing light, all right. I just looked it up. Wow, it's a glowing cat and I double check the day, a double check the damn like, this better not be an April Fool article. But it's not. I want one of those this photic Yeah, okay, so if you you're done, I'm done. Yeah. There's glowing rats too. You know these are baby cats I think you should punch. Are called kittens in some countries. Um, if you if you want to learn more about bioluminescence, you should type that in to the search bar. And you want to type b I O l U M I N E S C E n c E not ful in the search bar at how stuff works dot com, and it'll bring up this very cool article with some pretty glowing pictures. UM. And I said, uh, search bar somewhere in there, which means it's time for a listener mail. No it's not, Josh. Today's part two of you want to say it? For those of you don't know, this is a point at the show where we um thank people for little tokens and gifts and chatch keys and things that they have sent us food sometimes foods, and UM, it's a good chance to hear your name on the show as a as a thank you, and it's a good chance for some of you to find out where you can get some of these things, because a lot of times they're like really great creative, crafty things. People write books, and like, we want to support uh crafters and writers and bakers of cookies, and we want to support Bill Wagoner, who sent us a bumper sticker on how to pronounce Nevada Nevada. I'll never get used to that. It's not right. It is right, but I tell everyone that writes in only people from Nevada say it that way. Everyone else says Nevada Nevada. That's Nevada, all right. Lily, her sister Toby, and brother in law Danny start a company called Please Be Good Humans. Yeah, I mean they've gotten uh, they sent us some shirts. I think they sent some to the stickers. They've got them. Know, everybody has stickers. We passed them out. Oh well, Kristen Conger, I think that's short too though, Oh she did. I think so. Oh that's great. Um. And basically everything is has the p B g H logo on it, which is like, be good to each other, and of everything they sell goes to the charity of your choice. So if you go there, Please Be Good Humans. The Internet you can actually get some of the stuff and choose your own charity that will go to. Very nice message, Very nice. Um, how about some Randy Carbonny action. Yeah, he send us his Pirate Gag booklet, which is a tailor made for Pirate Day. Talk about too Pirate Day. If you want to learn more about that, you could go to Pirate Day p I R A T E A d A y dot blog spot dot com and hook up with Randy carbon Action. Christopher M. A Roth with an E at the end sent us a kN version of his book Dirk Danger Loves Life. I don't have a kindle yet, and I'm dying to read this thing, just sitting there. Um. Susannah from Archie the Archie Comics. Um, she sent us a bunch of stuff. She she she sends us stuff in like waves. I guess you could put it. But most recently, um, she sent us a Archie meets Kiss hardcover book of Kevin Keller book. Um, that's the first gay character. That's right, first gay comic book character. This whole green lantern hubbub. I haven't heard that. Oh yeah, there's apparently two green lanterns, and one of them came out as gay and it's just a man in the comic that he came out. And yeah, but Archie's gotta beat it's right because of Kevin Keller is the first gay character UH in the Jinx comics that Susannah is she draw right produced those which yeah, I mean that's her baby, So UM support the Jinx comics and Archie's a whole. She sent his shirts and what we're supposed to meet at UH Comic Con, but she said they were slammed in the booth and she was unable to get away. Oh I met Uncle John's Reader people. From reader People, they gave us shirts and hats, very nice, so thank you for that as well. We're from Mad Magazine too. Just like floored me. Yeah, did you write that guy back? I totally did you. Yeah, I finally did. Um. Daniel Mackenzie from Oakland, California Sennison LP from his band shut I Unison, awesome music, indie rock, little noisy, little melodic, right up my alley, shut Out Unison. I didn't see that one. It's good stuff. Um. Andy Parr Sentison edition of Games Magazine's World of Puzzles. Is that the one that had us as a clue. I believe. So yeah, stuff you should know was a clue in a word search. I believe nobody got it. I don't get this one. That's cool, but it was very nice that he uh he did. He went to that in trouble.
