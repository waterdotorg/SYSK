00:00:01
iHeart Intro: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01
Chuck: Continuing the Stuff You Should Know Summer movie playlist, This episode from February twenty fifteen focuses on some movies that changed filmmaking from the very beginning of the film industry up to Star Wars and beyond. All these movies pushed the whole thing forward that much more and got us to where we are today. And as a bonus, Mystery Science Theater three thousand makes a nice little cameo in here. Enjoy.

00:00:28
iHeart Intro: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of iHeartRadio.

00:00:38
Josh: Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles w Chuck Bryant aka Siskel, and.

00:00:45
iHeart Intro: Ebert save us the I'll see.

00:00:47
Josh: And Jerry's over there. I guess she's Gene Shallatt. That's the Stuff you Should Know triumph It.

00:00:57
iHeart Intro: I don't know why that tickled me so much, because Jane's Oh, it's a funny looking I guess, yeah, Jerry's not. I'm just picturing her with a big afro and a mustache and like a tweet jacket and bad opinions about movies.

00:01:09
Josh: Jean shell It had a look for sure.

00:01:11
iHeart Intro: Still though, he's around right, Oh yeah, I think so. Yeah, rip both Ciskel and Ebert so sad. I know. Have you seen the Roger Ebert documentary?

00:01:22
Josh: No, I've heard nothing but good things.

00:01:24
iHeart Intro: Really really good, very touching. Yeah. What is it?

00:01:28
Josh: Something Life, Life like mine, Life with Me, Life on Top, Life Itself, Life with thumbs, Life itself, Life.

00:01:37
iHeart Intro: Itself, Life with thumbs. It was really great. And I watched it and made the mistake of watching on a plane, and I was just like, my allergies were acting up. Oh yeah, oh yeah, I was. I was watering because of your allergies. No, because it was sad. I was crying. Do you want me to say it? Oh? Yeah, crying on a plane.

00:01:55
Josh: I was confused there for a second.

00:01:57
iHeart Intro: That's better than when I watch other movies that are on my laptop that are like have like bad violence or nudity or something. I'm always just like oh, and I kind of lower the laptop and it's like I didn't realize this was in here. And the lady next to me, he's just like, ugh, you disgust me, Yeah, because I don't. I want to be sensitive to people around me. You know, I'm not one of those jerks just like just lives in my own bubble. It's like watching some sex scene on a plane. You're like elbowing the ladies. So yeah, no, I hate it. That's it was so embarrassed. That happened to me a couple of times. I'm like, I needed to start going PG on movies. Yeah, like airplanes.

00:02:32
Josh: Judd Apatow huh am, I right, he's unpredictable.

00:02:35
iHeart Intro: Yeah, all right, So Chuck, this is your episode to shine Man, is it? Yes, you're a movie guy too, though.

00:02:43
Josh: I like movies, but I've I almost consciously don't let myself watch movies on a like.

00:02:50
iHeart Intro: A film aficionado level. Oh right, you pure enjoyment.

00:02:54
Josh: Yeah, I don't ever want to see the individual shots and just be like, oh well that could have been better whatever, Yeah, and just missed the movie as a whole.

00:03:05
iHeart Intro: Yeah. I fall somewhere in the middle of that. I try to let go. But like our our video producer director Casey is is pretty bad about that, and our buddy Scotty who shot our TV show, Uh oh he's the worst. Yeah, he's just the camera working that lighting in that scene.

00:03:21
Josh: Scott's awesome. Hey Scott, Hey Casey, they're all.

00:03:25
iHeart Intro: In here with us in spirit, and hey, this is the last show in the studio. Yeah, last episode in the old office. Yep, the murder Room.

00:03:32
Josh: Couldn't feel more neutral about it.

00:03:35
iHeart Intro: I actually feel less than neutral, less than zero. It's it's weird. That was a good movie. Thank you, great shots. Yeah, I say thank you as if I directed it.

00:03:44
Josh: A lot, right. I not only directed it, I also played Andrew McCarthy.

00:03:51
iHeart Intro: Uh. Yeah, I'm ready to get the heck out of here, man. I can't wait to get in that new office and that Yeah, it's gonna be good, tiny little dedicated studio.

00:03:58
Josh: Whole new world.

00:03:59
iHeart Intro: All right, let's do this.

00:04:01
Josh: Okay, So, Chuck films, you've seen one or two of them in your time? Sure, have you seen any of the ones in this list? I know you've seen a few of them, but have you seen like some of the early ones I've seen.

00:04:11
iHeart Intro: Well, we'll just go piece by piece because I have not seen Battleship Pataken Okay, but I do love Mandy Patankin. It's a little.

00:04:20
Josh: Different, yes, in spelling pronunciation meaning the whole thing.

00:04:24
iHeart Intro: Uh huh.

00:04:25
Josh: But it's close, I guess.

00:04:27
iHeart Intro: But we're talking, of course, about films that change filmmaking somewhere or another, and the first one on the list is from nineteen twenty five, Battleship Patamkin. That's hard for me to say.

00:04:39
Josh: Which is not the first movie, by the way. The first screen movie was Workers Leaving the Lumieer Factory, which is forty seven seconds long and the most boring piece of celluloid anyone's ever put together.

00:04:48
iHeart Intro: But it was the first, that's right.

00:04:50
Josh: This was many years. That was a full thirty years before Battleship Potempkin. By the time thirty years had passed, like, we were doing like narratives and there was banning and all sorts of great stuff. Yeah, and Battleship Patinkin fell under both of those umbrellas. It was a narrative story. It was a silent movie, that's right. But it told a pretty clear story. And it was a bit of Russian propaganda as well.

00:05:13
iHeart Intro: Yeah, it tells a story of a nineteen oh five uprising in where there were Russian sailors. Basically, there was a mutiny aboard a ship and then the bad guys, the Cossacks, came in looking for revenge.

00:05:27
Josh: Yeah, nineteen oh five that would have been rising up against tyranny, would have been rising up against the Romanov monarchy.

00:05:35
iHeart Intro: I guess nice.

00:05:37
Josh: But it was made in nineteen twenty five, so this is a time when you know, Lenin and Trotsky and all those dudes were running around trying to do the great experiment. Yeah, and it ends up it turns out that the Battleship Potemkin was banned in some countries. Some countries are like, we don't want this Rusky propaganda, right, But Russia itself later on banned when Stalin came to power because he was a self aware dictator.

00:06:03
iHeart Intro: Was that the deal? Yeah, Okay, he knew this.

00:06:06
Josh: Could be a metaphor for rising up against my dictatorship. So I'm going to just ban this, uhh yeah, even though it's Russian propaganda.

00:06:16
iHeart Intro: Well, filmatically, I need to bring the history, by the way. Filmatically speaking, it was a landmark film because of the montage, most notably the Russian or Soviet theory of montage, which is basically that your impact is going to come from juxtaposition of shots and not necessarily a smooth sequence of shots, right, and it should be rhythmic instead of necessarily being tied to the story. It was like a rhythmic series of shots and this one is popular. It was the Odessa step sequence as one of the five acts, and it is huge because it has been aped in mimic and mocked and homaged probably more than about more but a lot of times in film history.

00:07:06
Josh: Well, yeah, the montage, it's like a go to editing technique, right.

00:07:12
iHeart Intro: Oh yeah, well the montage in general, but specifically the Odessa Steps. Oh. There are two notable parts in that sequence. One is the you know, it's basically a big charge on these these grand steps leading up to a building in a big battle in Odessa, Odessa, Texas. And there's a part of it where there's the old the old baby carriage going down the steps. You know what's going to happen to the baby And it sounds tired because we've seen that in uh, you know, the Untouchables. Yeah, notably that I did not find it tiresome Naked Gun thirty three. And the third everything is Illuminated the Great movie by leav Schreiber. That was from directly from the Odessa Step sequence in Battleship Patinkin. The baby carriage. Yeah, and the old shot through the shot in the eye through the glasses, Oh cool, that comes from this movie too. They were the first ones to do it. Yeah, and you've seen that in Woody Allen's Love and Death and Bananas and of course The Godfather. The great sequence where Moe Green's getting the massage and he looks up and puts on his glasses during a montage. Yeah, that's exactly the whole sequence montage. Yeah, because there was an assassination on the steps as well.

00:08:24
Josh: Oh yes, that was definitely was a double Who was that? That was Francis Ford Coppola. Oh yeah, he was clearly aware of battleship put tempkin clearly. I was trying to think of other examples of montages and the only thing I could come up with was the a team building something. But that counts as a montage, right, Yeah.

00:08:41
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:08:41
Josh: It's like some related in some way related shots that are kind of put together that a little bit transcend like.

00:08:49
iHeart Intro: A story in itself. Yeah, like Rocky training for a fight. Yeah, that's another good A lot of times to set to music. Yeah, I love that. That's the only one you can think of. Yeah, and the Great movie Brazil Too has the shot through the glasses bit, as I like to call it.

00:09:05
Josh: So that's Battleship of Tenkin, doesn't one of the Nazis and Raiders of the Lost dar gets shot through the glasses.

00:09:10
iHeart Intro: Maybe that wouldn't surprise me. It's been it's been off homaged, you know.

00:09:16
Josh: Yeah, so Battleship to Tempkin was a It made a pretty big splash in nineteen twenty five. In nineteen twenty six, the following year, the next movie on the list. It wasn't his first, but it really solidified I think his stardom buster Keaton stardom.

00:09:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah, the general rightfully so too. Yeah, he was one of the great well some people calm, the greatest stuntman to ever live it.

00:09:42
Josh: He's done some stuff that I think earns him.

00:09:44
iHeart Intro: That, Yeah, because I mean this is back in the day too, where he was legitimately risking his life, right, you know, like.

00:09:50
Josh: That the very famously where he's standing on the street in front of a house and then the whole front of the house falls over him and the window just goes right around him.

00:09:59
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:10:00
Josh: I watched that again today. Yeah it is. I can't believe he did that. And there's actually a half of a second where his arm jerks up because he's startled as the house finally makes its way like into his peripheral vision. Yeah, and it has to be one of the most dangerous things that human beings ever done on film.

00:10:19
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I'm sure the whole time before that was like we did the math, right, he did the math. Do the math again, do the math again, Show me the math right, show me the math, because that's all it was. It was math in measurements, right. But yeah, he could have been squashed and killed very easily.

00:10:34
Josh: And he had a lot of faith in everybody who was pulling off the stunt with him. You know, he had to just stand there. That was his whole thing. He had to just stand there, and his bit was that he was he played it straight constantly. He was a stonefaced actor.

00:10:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, deadpan. Yeah, he kind of started that whole thing because his big I was about to say rival, but I guess just contemporary Charlie Chaplin, while similar in some ways, was completely different because Chaplin was constantly mugging for the camera and like asking for the audience sympathy, right, raising his eyebrows or yeah, like look, what's happening to me? Come on, come on, whereas Buster Keaton would just he had that dead pan look the whole time.

00:11:12
Josh: Yeah, he would go from like a house falling around him to jumping on a train or something like that with just the same blank facial expression.

00:11:22
iHeart Intro: Yeah. And the reason this is a highly influential film the generals because it kind of showcases the best of both the amazing stunts that would be mimicked and throughout the years and built upon, and then the deadpan style that influenced everyone from obviously Bill Murray is one of the great deadpan actors of all time. Yeah, Like you can count the number of times Bill Murray even smiles in a movie on like two hands, sure, much less like apes or laughs or anything.

00:11:50
Josh: Michael Sarah's mentioned in here, and I'm like he, I think he might have Bill Murray beat as far as the dead panpan actor goes.

00:11:57
iHeart Intro: Yeah, well, Zach galafanactis is on the list. He's soon for deadpan, Yeah, Leslie Nielsen, of course, Amy Poehler, I think is Uh is a woman that's a very dead pan has a deadpan style. Jason Swartzman, Yes, but people say this is this all is a direct descendant of Buster Keaton's work.

00:12:15
Josh: Yeah, And if you think we're overstating this, go watch any Buster Keaton movie. Yeah, you will be thrilled and delighted. And if your attention span has been shredded to ribbons by the Internet, just go onto YouTube and type in Buster Keaton and it'll bring up all sorts of clips of his awesome stunts.

00:12:33
iHeart Intro: Pretty great.

00:12:33
Josh: He will be thrilled in a mace, I promise.

00:12:35
iHeart Intro: Yeah. And I think I made a note here by the way, that we have a fatty arbuckle retraction to make. Remember when we we called him out as the rapist murderer, I didn't say murder, well, we said rapist at least, right, but we were taking the task by fan he was. He had, he was acquitted of all that stuff and apparently didn't do either act and his career in life and family name were room forever. So he was evidently done a grave miss justice, and we sort of cavalierly just still called him that to day.

00:13:08
Josh: Yeah, I need to look into it more, all right.

00:13:10
iHeart Intro: So next up we have the Jazz Singer, the nineteen twenty seven edition, not the Neil diamond one. No, And there was one in between two with Danny Thomas. I believe I like Neil Diamonds. It's good.

00:13:24
Josh: I never saw.

00:13:24
iHeart Intro: Do you ever see it? No, No, it's not bad. But this is the original from Alan Crossland, and it is notable because it was the first feature link movie that was at least twenty five percent spoken dialogue, right, Does that make sense? Yeah, it's totally new. Yeah it was. It wasn't the first talkie because they had short films that were talkies, and there was a movie the next year I'm sorry, Yeah, in nineteen twenty eight called Lights of New York that had one hundred percent full spoken dialogue, but the jazz singer had a mix of of music and spoken dialogue. Right, the first big, big daddy feature length film to do.

00:14:05
Josh: So right with substantial dialogue, right, Yeah. And they did it in the most roundabout difficult way that you could possibly do it, which is to record the audio and the soundtrack, both the dialogue and the music, onto vinyl records probably wax records really, and then the projectionist had to sync the record up with the film strip so everything was in sync.

00:14:32
iHeart Intro: Yeah. It was a device called a vitaphone that Warner Brothers sunk about half a million into this company called Western Electric who invented it, and it was actually physically connected to the projector's motor, so they did while they did have to sink it. It was a physical connection between the phonograph player and the projection real, I guess. And it went on to gross three and a half million bucks for nineteen twenty seven and then Man, a lot of dough.

00:15:01
Josh: That's a ton of dough. That's like five six million dollars today at.

00:15:05
iHeart Intro: Least, yeah, at least, but was ineligible for the Best Picture because they were just like, you can't compete with the rest. It's not fair. Oh wow, because everything else is silent and everyone's going to vote for you. Yeah, So that changed the whole game for sure.

00:15:22
Josh: We will continue on with our awesome and engrossing list right after this, So, Chuck, if you'll notice the first three movies in our list, the first three films that changed everything happened in nineteen twenty five, twenty six, and twenty seven.

00:15:57
iHeart Intro: Things were changing fast, they really were.

00:15:59
Josh: I mean we by leaps and bounds, sure, but you can also make the case that there was a lot of new ground to cover. So just about anybody who did anything new that was noteworthy of the innovation. Yeah, it was a big innovation yeah, harder to innovate these days, it is, and if you'll notice on the list, So the earliest ones were like technical editing innovations. Now, starting with Citizen Kane from nineteen forty one, we started to get into innovations and storytelling, which is a lot more nuanced than you know, doing your own stunts or using a montage or something. It's figuring out how to tell a story in a much less linear narrative fashion. And Citizen Kme was one of the early ones to pioneer a non linear narrative.

00:16:49
iHeart Intro: Yeah did you you saw this?

00:16:51
Josh: Yeah?

00:16:51
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I didn't see it untill I mean it was probably like probably about fifteen years ago, but like way later than you would think I would have seen. This is a big film buff.

00:17:02
Josh: I saw it in college at a in a film class.

00:17:07
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Sure, often. Yeah, if you sign up for a film class, you're going to study. Citizen came exactly pretty.

00:17:13
Josh: Much, and I finally found out what Rosebud was.

00:17:17
iHeart Intro: Don't ruin it.

00:17:18
Josh: I won't.

00:17:20
iHeart Intro: But it is a landmark film in every way, and it has often been top of best Films of All Time lists for great reasons, one of which, like you said, the non linear narrative was a really unique thing at the time. Although flashback wasn't brand new, it was the first time it had been this extensive and effective in the story.

00:17:41
Josh: Yeah, because I mean it's substantial enough that it really cuts up the flow. Oh yeah, you know, it's not like a quick flashback and they come back and the actors like staring off into space to transition back.

00:17:52
iHeart Intro: Into the present again.

00:17:54
Josh: I mean like it was all over the place.

00:17:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Some of the more concrete cinematic landmarks. One was using deep focus. Director of photography Greg Toland legend used he had used deep focus before on a movie called Long Voyage Home, but it's all over the place in Citizen Kane. And that basically means if you see a shot where something very far away is in focus in the shot basically where everything's in focus, or.

00:18:25
Josh: The background in the foreground or yeah, in focus, so you can press pause and look around exactly like you're sticking your head into a box.

00:18:32
iHeart Intro: Yeah. That's called deep focus, and it was brand new as far as Citizen Kane goes, is how extensive it used it. One of the other things was off center framing. It was a big, you know, pretty common thing to just center whatever the main action was either the character or the object, and Citizen Kane had a lot of things where the main focus of the scene the character, maybe even off screen, which was really weird at the time. People didn't know what to think of it, right, expressionistic lighting, uh back then everything they just lit it. They're like, make sure everything's well lit.

00:19:10
Josh: But it was an auto premenger also like a big pioneer with that.

00:19:14
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think so.

00:19:14
Josh: With Dalin for Murder, I think he directed that.

00:19:19
iHeart Intro: Was that Hitchcock? I think that was Hitchcock? Was it? Okay?

00:19:22
Josh: Well, auto premature directed stuff like that, though, right, he was very He used moody lighting and.

00:19:26
iHeart Intro: Chats and stuff a lot. I probably messed that up. People are gonna be Dalin for Murder, I think it was premiter okay, but orson Welles of course. I don't think we even mentioned that who wrote, directed, and starred and produced, and I think he even edited a Citizen Kane. Yeah, I just assumed everybody knew that, you know. Yeah, he came from the theater where you create mood with lighting only certain parts of the stage, so he brought that into the movies and it was very evocative and set the mood well, and people like, man, why we lighten everything all bright all the time? Look at Citizen Kane. It really worked. Yeah. A couple of other things, One of which I know you will appreciate, sir, is that he pretty much invented the wipe. Oh the star wipe, not the star wipe, but it followed. Yeah, the star wipe followed, okay, which I know is your favorite transition in cinema. Oh, it's all star.

00:20:24
Josh: Wis star because it almost makes a sound, you know.

00:20:29
iHeart Intro: Uh.

00:20:30
Josh: And by the way, I want to say, you're right, dall, I'm for murderer. It was Hitchcock, Oh was it?

00:20:33
iHeart Intro: Yeah? Okay, what was premature? Did you look that up?

00:20:36
Josh: He did one called Laura the Man with the Golden Arm. It's not who I'm thinking of. I'm thinking of a director named Auto who directed in like the twenties or thirties, and he directed like moody, like like moody movies.

00:20:51
iHeart Intro: Like yeah, murder movies. Yeah, like fil noir, Yes.

00:20:54
Josh: Film noir. That's exactly what I was going for. And I don't remember who it was.

00:20:59
iHeart Intro: Maybe his name was a film noir He's French. And then one final thing of course you could study Citizen Kane for a week in the film class, so this is an overview. But the low angle shots. People didn't use a lot of lower high angle shots back then. It was kind of just shot from straight on and Orson Wells even dug out cut out the floor a lot of times to get the camera lower. And for the first time we saw ceilings in view in a movie, because quite often things were shot on a sound stage where you don't have ceilings, and he wanted those low angle shots, so they used fabric most times to act as a ceiling, but very effective shots of from below of Orson Wells. As I mean, it wasn't exactly William Randolphurst, but it was an approximation of William Randolphurst, so very effective low angle stuff that now, I mean, we take for granted all these things, but you know, there would be no pulp fiction in that non linear story telling. If there was no well maybe somebody would have done it, but.

00:22:03
Josh: Maybe eventually, but even first he did the first and that's why it was innovative.

00:22:08
iHeart Intro: Exactly.

00:22:09
Josh: It's Fritz Lang.

00:22:10
iHeart Intro: Yeah, there you go, Yeah, Fritz Lang Metropolis and am just m that's okay, Yeah, it's all making sense now, I get confused. Yeah, but you were right, You were right there.

00:22:21
Josh: Fritz and Auto are not close.

00:22:23
iHeart Intro: I mean they're both German, but that's about it. Yeah, but you know the difference between M and dial M just a telephone. What's up next, Chuck Breathless one of my faves.

00:22:35
Josh: So I am going to rely on you mostly for this one because I looked up what the French New Wave really did, what it accounted for. Yeah, and like all of the essays I found were hard to they were dense. Yeah, and I didn't really understand. I understood that the French New Wave like changed everything, and that a lot of the movies that I know and love today are the offspring of the French New Wave, but I still didn't get exactly specifically what the French New Wave did.

00:23:08
iHeart Intro: And you're gonna allow me to summarize this, yeah, no pressure, No, Well, for me, the French New Wave basically ushered in an era of what now I think most people might associate with indie filmmaking.

00:23:22
Josh: Okay, okay, like.

00:23:25
iHeart Intro: Handheld camera work and what some people at the time considered amateurish camera work movies where maybe not a lot seemingly happens. You know, nothing grand happens, which was the case in Breathless. A lot of people didn't like it at the time because it was like, you know, not much happens. You know that the two leads in the movie, Jean Paul Belmondo and Geene c Berg, weren't really like, didn't show express a whole lot of deep love, and there weren't these big moments of love and affection and these huge action sequences. And it was described as flat by a lot of people. And I think a lot of indie movies do that, just kind of show life as it happens.

00:24:05
Josh: Yeah, So without Breathless, who wouldn't have, like Bottle Rocket.

00:24:09
iHeart Intro: Maybe Wes Anderson's definitely a big French New wave guy, Yeah for sure. But uh godar John lu Goodard who directed it, and Trufau and some other French New wave forefathers were film critics at first. Oh yeah, yeah, and they decided as a group, like, we want to look at cinnamon a new way and do something different, So they went and started making their own movies.

00:24:35
Josh: That's like James Fenimore Cooper, Oh yeah, the guy who wrote Last of the Mohicans. Oh really Yeah. He apparently used to complain that, like nobody wrote good books anymore, and so I think his wife or something said, well, why don't you do it, big shot?

00:24:50
iHeart Intro: And he did.

00:24:51
Josh: In the books he wrote really weren't so great, but he went and wrote him and he wrote a bunch of them too.

00:24:57
iHeart Intro: One of my favorite foresides ever, is the second to the to the Mohicans. It's just a line of Native Americans. In the second to the last one, they're online facing away. You just sort of turning around and waving a camera I guess the camera at Gary Larson's hand. So Breathless is notable for those reasons. It kind of kicked off the French New Wave. But the use of jump cut editing, which we see so much now, it was the first movie and it was very jarring at the time to see jump cuts in a movie. And that's when you're showing, like I guess the best way to describe it as multiple shots of the same subject or thing from different angles.

00:25:38
Josh: Right, It's like you indicate the progression of time or movement or something by just cutting quickly rather than focusing on somebody walking down the street for five minutes. Yeah, you cut a couple of times and all of a sudden they're just closer to the camera, then closer and closer, and then they're past the camera.

00:25:55
iHeart Intro: It's a jump cut, yeah, or even as simple, something as simple as like you're going to leave the house, so you go and pick up your keys and you put on your coat. Instead of showing all that you come out of the bedroom, Boom, you're putting on your coat. Boom, you're putting the keys in the door.

00:26:08
Josh: Right exactly, You're just showing the high highlights of this progression of stuff where that would otherwise be boring to watch the whole thing. But it also is used to create tension too, because it's it's jarring. I guess it's probably why it creates tension. And Scorsese famously used it in Goodfellas. Oh yes, at the end when Henry Hill is like trying to sell some guns to Nero. Yeah's coat to the gills, right, and he's like trying to sell some guns to Nero but they don't fit the silencers, and like he's the helicopter's following them. He's got the sauce going and all this stuff is being represented and compressed in a very short amount of time by the use of jump cuts.

00:26:50
iHeart Intro: Yeah, very effective, and for budding filmmakers, it's a great way to hide mistakes of things you may not have gotten that you thought you got. Jump cutting is a really easy way to just sort of, yeah, to hide your errors. Yeah. I did it a lot. In other words, when I was making.

00:27:09
Josh: Those shorts, I I was I realized that in my head, I was referencing the shot in Soul Taker. You know, have you ever seen that mystery Sigence three thousand with uh it's his last name is Estevez is Martin Sheen's brother, and he is a soul taker and he's next to this guy who's a soul taker.

00:27:32
iHeart Intro: You just have to see this.

00:27:33
Josh: But anyway, they're they're walking down the road in this jump cut, like has this progression of them right, It's so unnecessary, but it's like a great use of jump cut. You could tell the director was like, I can't wait to use a jump cut, and that's what she did.

00:27:46
iHeart Intro: She used it on.

00:27:48
Josh: But go watch the MSc three K it's a good one man.

00:27:52
iHeart Intro: You did you see every single one of those episodes?

00:27:54
Josh: No, it's still I still run across ones that I haven't seen.

00:27:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah, nice, hey, and then shout out to Bill Corbett, who I know is a listener.

00:28:04
Josh: Oh yeah, he is, isn't he.

00:28:05
iHeart Intro: I don't know if he's going to hear this one, but the great Bill Corbett, So take here. Next week, are gonna move on to Frederico Fellini's Eight and a half. Have you ever seen this one?

00:28:19
Josh: No?

00:28:19
iHeart Intro: I haven't.

00:28:20
Josh: It's good now I understand why it's called that though.

00:28:22
iHeart Intro: Yeah. It was one of the first, although not the first, movies about movie making and starring the great Marcela Masteriania Mastroiani from La Delceavita, a muse of Felini's over the years too. And this one, this one really kicked off the surrealist filmmaking and sort of saying you can play around and shoot a dream sequence where the guy's in traffic and then he leaves his car and floats up in the air and is, you know, being pulled down to the ground on the beach from a rope tied around his ankle, just like go nuts.

00:28:57
Josh: Yeah, and successive filmmakers did go nuts, like Gondry did Eternal Sun, The Spotless Mind.

00:29:04
iHeart Intro: Oh yeah, he's hugely influenced.

00:29:06
Josh: Darren Aronofsky did some weird stuff here or.

00:29:09
iHeart Intro: There, Yeah, David Lynch and Terry Gilliam of course. Yeah.

00:29:13
Josh: Just basically surrealism is what I'm taking Fellini introduced.

00:29:17
iHeart Intro: Into this, Yeah, for real. And besides the surrealism, that opening sequence of Eight and a Half where the director of he's the director in the movie Guido is stuck in traffic. It's really claustrophobic feeling, and that's why he floats away and escapes. You know that, that traffic jam, but that was directly mimicked in like Rams Everybody Hurts video. Oh yeah, and the beginning of the movie Falling Down. Do you remember that huh that started with the traffic jam. Yeah, Michael Douglass just left.

00:29:49
Josh: He doesn't float, he gets like an oozy.

00:29:52
iHeart Intro: I saw that again the other day. Most of it to hold up. It's weird. It alternately felt way ahead of its time and also very dated. Yeah, because the stuff that Michael Douglas is doing felt way ahead of its time. But then there was I just forgot about that whole weird subplots with Robert Duvall retiring and he had this wife that was Hnpecking them and like this retirement party they were trying to throw them.

00:30:20
Josh: I forgot about that too.

00:30:21
iHeart Intro: Yeah. It was just so unnecessary and felt really weird and out of place. The other day when I was watching it was.

00:30:27
Josh: There like a jump cut montage where he's putting on his watch, his gold retirement watch.

00:30:33
iHeart Intro: No, but then too, the Barbara Hershey, you know, is in venice at home with the daughter, and he spends a whole day coming there to grab them, basically, and the whole time she just keeps calling the cops like no, he's coming, and now he's coming. And I was watching the other day it was like freaking leave. Oh, yeah, what are you doing there?

00:30:50
Josh: Yeah, that's a movie character thing.

00:30:54
iHeart Intro: You know.

00:30:55
Josh: That's just bad writing, bad directing when you just walk right past the ability to you missed a huge step.

00:31:03
iHeart Intro: Where were we falling down? Yeah? I think that pretty much sums up eight and a half.

00:31:07
Josh: I think so too, falling down boom, so chuck. We got a little more left, we got more films. Is this making you want to watch films?

00:31:14
iHeart Intro: Yeah? Me too.

00:31:15
Josh: I feel like eating ice cream watching a film and scratching from Poison ivy.

00:31:21
iHeart Intro: Lately, Yeah, and burning this office down.

00:31:24
Josh: You know, if that happens now, suspicion is going to fall on you for saying that. That's all right, we'll be right back after that. All right, So we're back with our awesome jingles, which, by the way, we have to thank John began, John begin begin. He even emailed with the pronunciation on his name. But he the original guy who did our jingle, the first jingle ever, Rusty Mattias or Matthias Man, I'm not good with the pronunciation. Uh well, anyway, Rusty who's banned the sheep Dogs are on tour right now.

00:32:17
iHeart Intro: Yeah. Just because his.

00:32:19
Josh: Work was so original, we contacted him and said, hey, we got this other guy who's done like covers of your work. Can we use these It's like totally mash it up. Yeah, and John's been making awesome like versions of it ever since.

00:32:32
iHeart Intro: Yeah. They're both great and talented.

00:32:34
Josh: Thanks to you both.

00:32:35
iHeart Intro: And go check out I think that what you say. They're on tour right yeah, the sheep Dogs. Yeah, go check out the sheep Dogs. Yeah, in in town near you. Yeah. All right, let's finish with these two in reverse order. Okay.

00:32:47
Josh: Toy story was a big one, hugely innovative, huge. And again it's one of those things where now almost everything about it seems pedestrian.

00:32:57
iHeart Intro: Su or what it did. Yeah, you see, it's still a.

00:32:59
Josh: Great movie, I'm sure. Oh yeah, but the innovations that it undertook are it just seemed pedestrian. But at the time it was totally groundbreaking.

00:33:09
iHeart Intro: Yeah, game changer.

00:33:10
Josh: It was the first, the first CGI movie, all CGI movie ever. Yeah, that was enormous.

00:33:16
iHeart Intro: Well yeah, and I remember at the time seeing it and just being like, Wow, this is the future of animated films.

00:33:24
Josh: What's the best all CGI animated film you've ever seen?

00:33:27
iHeart Intro: Visually? Uh, well, I haven't seen a lot of them these days because Emily doesn't like those. So I probably wouldn't be the best person to ask Holly from Stuff Sovius in history class, she'd probably be the one to ask for my money.

00:33:42
Josh: Have you seen The Adventures of ten Tin?

00:33:44
iHeart Intro: Oh? Yeah, that was amazing, mind blowing. Yeah, I saw that on your recommendation. Really really liked it. Yeah.

00:33:52
Josh: The story was great, the action was great, the characters were great. But the CGI, the computer animation, is I think possibly the best ever done.

00:34:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and that's a bit of a different style than say, like up or The Incredibles. It's not nearly as cartoons. It's like the I. I think it's the motion capture. Yeah, I think that's what they did for that.

00:34:12
Josh: Oh yeah, with UP, it would strictly be totally just animation.

00:34:15
iHeart Intro: Right, yeah, but I mean they're both animation, right. But yeah, Man, Tintin, that was really good. It was good. I was surprised how much I like that.

00:34:22
Josh: But UP was good too, and Toy Story was good too. But all of these things came as a result of the ground that Toy Story.

00:34:28
iHeart Intro: Broke absolutely in nineteen ninety five. Like you said, what seems like a common thing today. I mean, you don't see cell animation anymore. It's almost I know, I kind of miss it. I totally miss we Like the new Mickey Mouse is all weird in CG like stuff from our generation should have just been discontinued. Yeah, and then you just come up with all new stuff that's CGI. Strawberry Shortcake not supposed to be CGI. It just all looks weird. Now. Yeah, I wish there would have people would have done a little bit of both still, because I think sell animation, like I think the Iron Giant came out after Toy Story, and they did sell animation and that was great, great movie. I haven't seen that. Oh it's really good. You'd like it, like it's a movie for grown ups. And Toy Story sort of laid the way for that because it was one of the first movies, I guess cartoony kids movies to really have a lot of dialogue that flew over kids heads that adults got a little nod in a wink. What Toy Story. Yeah, not like dirty humor, but it's not like Fritz the Cat, no no, no, but a little entendre here and there that adults might appreciate the kids won't understand. Those are the best.

00:35:36
Josh: Jokes, right.

00:35:40
iHeart Intro: And now we have you know, best Animated Feature in the Oscars, which definitely came straight out of the original Toy Story. Because movies started being considered before they created its own category. Up and Toy Story three were actually nominated for regular Best Picture, and I think everyone was like, oh, we need to get to their own category, because yeah, you can't have an animated movie when best Picture it came.

00:36:03
Josh: Well up would have come after the Best Animated Picture category came out. Oh really, So that kind of GHEs as a testament to just how amazing that movie is.

00:36:15
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that's right. That was that.

00:36:16
Josh: It was still for Best Picture.

00:36:18
iHeart Intro: Oh, it was both.

00:36:19
Josh: I don't know if it was up for it probably was up for Best Animated as well, but it was definitely also up for Best Picture. Wow, while there was an animated category.

00:36:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I never considered that. Bam, that was a good movie.

00:36:31
Josh: Yeah, I was sweet.

00:36:34
iHeart Intro: So I got nothing else on toy story.

00:36:36
Josh: Well then what about the last one?

00:36:38
iHeart Intro: Yeah, two thousand and one of Space Odyssey. Man, quite a film.

00:36:43
Josh: You sent this essay on Criterion I think Criterion dot com, but you know the Criterion collection.

00:36:50
iHeart Intro: Yeah.

00:36:51
Josh: It was written, I guess in nineteen eighty eight. Even though it says posted in nineteen eighty eight. It's like there wasn't an internet to post it on in nineteen eighty eight.

00:36:59
iHeart Intro: Maybe it means posted like in the mail.

00:37:01
Josh: Maybe. But I realized, like I can read film essays about Stanley Kubrick's work all day long.

00:37:10
iHeart Intro: Yeah, me too. Like I love that.

00:37:12
Josh: Documentary Room two to two seven. It was two three seven, two four six, you know, the one about the shining conspiracy theory.

00:37:23
iHeart Intro: Yeah, the number of the room is amazing. I can't remember, though I read a bunch.

00:37:27
Josh: Of articles is I think two thirty seven. I read a bunch of articles around the release of that documentary, which we're basically like film essays on the shining. I read this one amazing one from several years ago about Eyes Wide Shut about how it's like a masterpiece of sociology, studying sociology.

00:37:48
iHeart Intro: A lot of people hate that movie.

00:37:50
Josh: Yeah, and then now this like two thousand and one. I'm sure there's tons out there to consume, but I can just read that stuff all day long because that guy was so just amazingly detailed as a director.

00:38:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I agree. I can read more about his work critical essays on his work than any other director. Right, it's just unbelievable. It's almost like it's its own genre. It is, you know, Kubrickian. Yeah, it's got a word named after it, and well it should so. Two thousand and one. A Space Odyssey nineteen sixty eight blue minds back then blows minds today one for it's just the amazing look and the technical achievement ages really well. I mean, if you see a movie from nineteen sixty eight about outer space, it still looks like the future. Yeah, he don't expect it to hold up well, but it totally does, so much so that a lot of the you know, George Lucas and Ridley Scott were just like it's done right, Like we might as well give up.

00:38:46
Josh: Yeah, George Lucas when Star Wars came out, said Star Wars is technically comparable, but for my money, two thousand and one is by far the better movie.

00:38:55
iHeart Intro: Yeah, everyone was sort of intimidated, I think by how talented Kubrick was.

00:38:59
Josh: Well. Plus all, so you have to take into account that he made this movie at a time when other sci fi movies were just pure shlock. So not only to make the movie in this way this visually amazing and amazing with an audio soundtrack and just totally innovative, it also took like that mindset can just completely go in a different direction that everybody else has as well.

00:39:26
iHeart Intro: Yeah, of course I think about Ridley Scott saying that, and then he goes on to make Alien and Blade Runner after that. So I mean he helped Prometheus. Man.

00:39:35
Josh: Yeah, people don't like Prometheus.

00:39:37
iHeart Intro: I don't care. It's a cool movie. No, I liked it too, I thought, Okay, one flaw, the big flaw to me was.

00:39:46
Josh: And I'm sure it's like part of the subtext or the context or one of the texts, but the engineer coming back to life or coming out of hibernation after however long and just immediate, like inflicting violence on these pea brained humans who are showing him no threat whatsoever. Yeah, I just thought it was a little, uh, it wasn't explained well enough, I think for my taste.

00:40:14
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I think i'd agree with you.

00:40:16
Josh: But when I'm watching a Ridley Scott movie, I just assume if I'm missing something, he has an explanation for it.

00:40:22
iHeart Intro: I'm just not catching it. Yeah, I know what you mean. I'd like I think I read some stuff about how it tied into the alien cannon and realized I need to go see it again with all this knowledge that I wasn't really thinking about. Yeah, and maybe i'd like it more. Yeah, but I haven't done that yet. So back to two thousand and one. Oh Yeah. It was also notable for being bookended basically with thirty minutes of silence on both ends of the movie. The first thirty minutes or and when I say silent, I mean no dialogue, right, and the last thirty minutes have no dialogue. Yeah.

00:40:55
Josh: The last line comes like a full thirty minutes before the end.

00:40:58
iHeart Intro: Yeah, And over the one hundred and forty six minutes, there are only forty minutes of dialogue and the whole thing. And that's why I just when people compare something like Interstellar, then call it Kubrickan. I just want to smash do you know like Interstellar? Not really?

00:41:15
Josh: Oh, I liked it.

00:41:16
iHeart Intro: I was super letdown.

00:41:17
Josh: Despite McConaughey doing Waterson in the future. I still liked it. I even liked him in it.

00:41:24
iHeart Intro: I liked a lot of the parts of it. But to me, it's anti Kubrickian because every ten minutes they're explaining everything that's going on over again. That was a thing just like Inception.

00:41:37
Josh: Ellen Page's entire character was written in to explain what was going on every ten minutes.

00:41:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, and I felt like Interstellar was the same way. It's like Christopher Nolan needs to just trust his audience a little bit like kubrick did, and so you figure it out or don't. Yeah, no, I'm not going to stop every ten minutes just to explain everything. Yeah, here's just going on. I remember if you didn't get it right. Here's what's going on again.

00:41:59
Josh: Well, I think if they are labeling something like Interstellar is Kubrickian, right, one of the ways that you can interpret that is that he was he rooted his two thousand and one in science fact right, So like the stuff that the astronauts are like dealing with and the things that are going on and the conditions of space, it was all factual. Whereas with Interstellar, same thing. They went to really great lengths to do what they could to make everything scientifically factual. Aside from the fact that the idea that you could go into a black hole and then come back out or something like that, Sure, drifting in space that's not gonna happen. But for the most part, Interstellar was scientifically accurate. So maybe that's what they meant when they called it Kubrickian, because you're absolutely right, like they did explain a lot and went to great links to explain a lot, whereas with two thousand and one you just watch it the first five times like what just happened? And apparently Carrie Grant had that same reaction as well.

00:43:02
iHeart Intro: That was Rock Hudson, Rock Hudson, that's right. Yeah, the original screening that Roger Ebert was at in La Rock. Hudson just left and said, can somebody tell me what the hell that was about? Yeah, and it wasn't even over yet. Yeah. Yeah. Well the reason it it has science fact and not science fiction is because Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark, who it wasn't actually a book that was made into a movie. It was a movie or book made after a movie, and they collaborated on both. And they went to Carl Sagan of course of Cosmos and said.

00:43:36
Josh: He said, you're going to make billions And that was pretty good, was it?

00:43:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, that sound a lot like them. They went to Carl Sagan said, hey, we want to portray these extraterrestrials. Are they maybe the Star Child is or they turned Dave into the Star Child? Are they humanoids? What are they going to look like? And Sagan was like they were very unlikely to be humanoid. So Kubrick did the smart thing and was just like, well, we just won't show him right at all, instead of making a fool of myself like signs and making some dumb looking out Oh man, man, let me just not show the aliens. Very smart move. Getting back to the story of two thousand and one.

00:44:23
Josh: Although I think the Village is underrated.

00:44:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I can stomach that one. What about well, you like the sixth sense? Right?

00:44:32
Josh: Everybody like the sixth sense? Sure, I guess that was it for him.

00:44:36
iHeart Intro: I loved Unbreakable.

00:44:37
Josh: Unbreakable, Yeah, that was one where like, yeah, I think it was maybe even better the second time.

00:44:42
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I still like that movie. But then he also made that Lady in the Water movie and the the one with Marky Mark the people were jumping off.

00:44:52
Josh: Four brothers, no, three kings? Is it the one in the Elevator?

00:44:59
iHeart Intro: No, he just produced that. Oh I know what you're talking about, the one where people like jumping off of buildings and stuff inexplicably. Yeah, I didn't even I didn't see that. You couldn't get through ten minutes of that movie. So two thousand and one Back to Good Movies had a three acts, three part structure, but not a conventional three act structure that you might be used to in movies, which is why it confounded people like Rock Hudson. The first they call the movements. The first movement was the Dawn of Man sequence with the apes with a Monolith, and he has that great part where he throws his little bone tool up in the air, right, and then it morphs into all lot morphs, but it maybe is a dissolve into the spinning in outer space.

00:45:46
Josh: It's called the match cut.

00:45:48
iHeart Intro: Yeah, match cut, and of the rotation of what we now know was a nuclear warhead. Because I read that little article twenty Things you Didn't Know about two thousand and one, I didn't know those were nuclear heads necessarily in outer space. They made it a little more vague, and initially it was going to be more explicit and they were going to explode it in outer space, right, but he said, now it's a little too close to the ending of Stranger. Yeah, so let's not do that. Yeah, probably good choice.

00:46:17
Josh: Yeah, But as a result, some people have taken it to mean that like it was. That match cut was supposed to show how far humans have come from using a bone to murder somebody to satellites in space. But if you know that the satellite is actually loaded down with nuclear warheads, that match cut demonstrates how little humans have changed from using a bone to murder somebody to using satellites to murder somebody. The motif is still the same and it's murder.

00:46:46
iHeart Intro: Yeah, he was going for some deep things. Oh yeah, a lot of metaphor happening. Yeah.

00:46:51
Josh: I mean supposedly in every single shot, because he started out as a still photographer, right, Yeah, supposedly every frame of a Kubrick movie. You there is nothing that isn't unintentional in placed there by him. He did a lot of his own set decorating.

00:47:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah, Like the pencil holder on the desk in the office of the guy at the Shining Hotel, right was where it's supposed.

00:47:11
Josh: To be, right, and if like if it has like a picture of a goat head inscribed on it, that means something, right, it's not accidental.

00:47:19
iHeart Intro: Yeah, although we'll say room two thirty seven, which I think may have been the point is a little bit like these people are crazy, not like, oh man, I just see what they're saying in all this, Right, I was just thinking, these people are nuts.

00:47:32
Josh: Right, It's it was just kind of enjoyable to hear their interpretations of it well, and.

00:47:37
iHeart Intro: I think it had It was a comment on obsession and fandom more so than the Shining.

00:47:42
Josh: For sure, But there I thought there are some of their ideas were oea interesting, totally. I said, room too two seven, didn't I like one with conspiracy theorists like, may.

00:47:54
iHeart Intro: What in room two two seven? Like a sitcom?

00:47:57
Josh: Yeah, it was just called two two seven.

00:47:58
iHeart Intro: Okay, yeah, gotcha. I remember it was Jack Kay.

00:48:01
Josh: She'd be like me, oh, okay, that's what my impression was. What'd you think I was doing? Well?

00:48:06
iHeart Intro: I wasn't sure what she meant being a weirdo. Yeah, yeah, okay. The second movement was, of course the House sequence, the computer, the how was it? The How nine thousand? Yeah, really creepy, and How ended up being a lot of people's favorite character, even though it was just a voice the supercomputer on the Discovery ship. Rememberies like what are you doing today? It's so creepy. I had the Mad Magazine spoof of two thousand and one when I was a kid. It was great. Yeah. And then the third movement is when Dave moves on to the next stage of human development with these extraterrestrials that you only hear, and basically it's when it comes full circle the third movement.

00:48:52
Josh: And the third movement is the one that has almost well, it's really just the second movement that has a dialogue.

00:48:59
iHeart Intro: Yeah, some of the alternate titles for two thousand and one Journey Beyond the Stars terrible, Universe not bad, Yeah, okay, Tunnel to the Stars so great, Planet Fall that sounds bad.

00:49:13
Josh: It sounds like a James Bond movie.

00:49:15
iHeart Intro: And then How the Solar System was one as a play on how the West was won.

00:49:20
Josh: Yeah, which, like movie geeks would find that appealing, but everybody else would say, that's you ruined everything.

00:49:27
iHeart Intro: Yeah, And Kubrick was this is the last thing I have. He was so obsessive with protecting his material that he allegedly, I don't think allegedly. I think he did have all the sets and props and miniatures destroyed after he shot it so they would never be reused, which is a common thing at the time. Yeah, okay, we're doing a space movie. Go get that Go get that space ring from Stanley set. Yeah, let's reuse it for Planet Fall.

00:49:53
Josh: He also destroyed all of the footage that didn't make it into the original theat release. Yeah, destroyed it's gone.

00:50:02
iHeart Intro: Yeah, so they wouldn't one day after his death recut it, which they invariably probably would have done.

00:50:07
Josh: Yep, he's a smart man.

00:50:09
iHeart Intro: Yeah, I could. We should just do a podcast on Kubrick.

00:50:13
Josh: Okay he was I'm down for that challenge.

00:50:16
iHeart Intro: He'd be a dude. Yes, one of my heroes. Yeah. Cinematically, you got anything else? I got nothing else.

00:50:24
Josh: If you want to know more about movies. If you like this one, you probably also love our exploitation episode Exploitation movie episode fun one. What else have we talked about movies and Cannonball Run?

00:50:35
iHeart Intro: Oh yeah, I had a lot to do with the movie. Yeah. Our James Bond episode. Yeah yeah. We've had a few of these, and people always respond to these real like you guys should have a spin off.

00:50:45
Josh: Should do an all movie podcast. Sure, maybe one day.

00:50:48
iHeart Intro: Maybe.

00:50:48
Josh: Remember if you're looking for any of these, press control F or Apple F in your web browser and search that way. On our podcast archive page. You can also search for the article on how Stuff Works by typing movies in and seeing what comes up. And since I said how stuff works, it is time for a listener mail.

00:51:11
iHeart Intro: I'm going to call this Mike coul DuPont really clear something up for us on scientific method. Hey guys, it was a great well, actually, he doesn't say it was great. I think I just made that up. Hey, guys, your scientific method podcast has a consistent misuse of what a scientific law is in relation to the working of the scientific method. It appears that you believe that a law e g. Newton's law of gravity is held in higher esteem than theory, that eventually a theory matures into a law. I think I probably did think that because of politics. Right, you know, bill becomes a law, right exactly, he says, when in fact, theory is considerably more robust than a law. A law is a mathematical model that describes observed behavior, does not answer the why. Theory does answer why something happens.

00:51:57
Josh: Did we not say that? I thought we did well, Like I knew that. I remember finding that out from the research. I just can't believe it didn't come out of my mouth.

00:52:05
iHeart Intro: He claims. We did not, And I feel like I'm learning this so I definitely did not. Okay, go ahead, but you may have. For example, Newton's law of gravitational attraction describes the action of two bodies that can be used for pretty much everything. It is perfect for describing what happens, but it cannot tell you why the two items are attracted or drilled down to the underlying mechanism.

00:52:25
Josh: Yeah, A law is like much more succinct.

00:52:27
iHeart Intro: It just is what it is, Nor is the law even universal, and could not be used to explain the Parahelian procession of Mercury's orbit burn. In comparison, Einstein's theory of general relativity was eventually used to solve the mercury issue. Oh yeah, the mercury issue and the standard model, along with the recent discovery of the Higgs boson my cern can answer the why do these two masses attracted to each other? A question? I think what you mean is why are these two mass is attracted to one another? Mike, it's pretty teleological theory is considerably more developed and richer than a scientific law, which is more of a tool that is applicable to a wide range of applications. Keep up the good work that is, Mike DuPont.

00:53:13
Josh: Thanks Mike, thanks for that of the Valley Forge.

00:53:16
iHeart Intro: DuPonts. I think, so, huh have you seen Fox Catcher? Oh no, I've heard it's good. Is it good? No? Really? I don't think so. No. I've heard it's kind of slow.

00:53:27
Josh: It's beyond slow.

00:53:29
iHeart Intro: Really?

00:53:29
Josh: Oh yeah, I can understand why the Academy loved it, or sure a lot of people I'm sure do like it. I was not a fan of Fox.

00:53:41
iHeart Intro: I think people generally seeing like a turn by an actor like Steve Curl doing something really different, they're knocked out by that. No, I still can't believe you didn't like Birdman. No spoiler alert for people who have not seen Birdman. The following conversation is full of spoilers. Yes, what didn't you like about it?

00:54:00
Chuck: So?

00:54:00
iHeart Intro: I thought?

00:54:01
Josh: I thought Michael Keene was good?

00:54:03
iHeart Intro: Okay? Who plays his daughter Emily Blunt? Is that? Who that is? Emma Stone? Emma Stone? Excellent? Okay?

00:54:12
Josh: Ed Norton even pretty good?

00:54:13
iHeart Intro: Okay, so the acting was fine? Who is Naomi Watson was in it? Yeah? She did great?

00:54:19
Josh: Okay, So yes the acting. The acting was fine. Sure that the acting was fine. I thought the photography was amazing.

00:54:26
iHeart Intro: Yeah, the whole seemingly one take thing kind of knocked you out.

00:54:29
Josh: Probably I didn't even pick up on that, but yes it did. It was more the uh the for me, the juxtaposition of the story, which was pretty boring and realistic in everyday life. Even though it was about a Broadway production, it was still about the everyday.

00:54:48
iHeart Intro: Life of it.

00:54:49
Josh: Sure, against the surrealism that's like threaded and embedded in it throughout the whole movie. I didn't like that. Okay, it was like choose one or the other man?

00:54:59
iHeart Intro: Gotcha? It irked. And then just so that.

00:55:03
Josh: One part with the critic where Michael Keaton tells off the critic.

00:55:06
iHeart Intro: I thought Michael Keaton.

00:55:07
Josh: Did a wonderful job, but just the whole point that it was in there of like the director, you know, using Michael Keaton's character to tell off all the critics he's.

00:55:18
iHeart Intro: Ever wanted to tell off in his movie.

00:55:20
Josh: Yeah, I just thought it was pretentious and I thought it was kind of clumsy in that sense too, and it was enough that it.

00:55:26
iHeart Intro: It attainted it. Yeah, and then the ending. I did not like the ending at all at all. That'll ruin a good.

00:55:36
Josh: Movie because it was it completely went contrary to all the other stuff that he went out of his way to point out was fake or fraudulent or not real, and then all of a sudden, it is what Yeah, no choose one or the other. The director refused to make very important decisions, and I think that that ruined the movie.

00:55:56
iHeart Intro: That is a very well thought out the criticism.

00:56:00
Josh: Thank you, thank you very much. Sure, uh man, that was the end of listener mail even, wasn't it.

00:56:06
iHeart Intro: Yeah, Because now I'm not like Chez Josh is weird he didn't like Birdman. Now I'm like, just didn't like Birdman. He has good reasons. Thank you, Thank you.
