Josh: Hey, you welcome to the short Stuff. I'm Josh, there's Chuck, Jerry's floating around out there somewhere, and Dave c is here in spirit. So the gang is all ready to go with short Stuff. Let's talk about funerals, baby, Let's talk about you being dead. Let's talk about all the good things and the bad things happened to your head after you die. Yeah. Man, we should just stop and in this episode because it will be the best episode in the history of the show. All right, Well that's it for short Stuff. Everybody, Short Stuff is out. Oh wait, we gotta stop for an head break. Oh yeah, that's right. Uh yeah. So we're talking about funerals, and we've talked a little bit about this stuff over the years in our Death Suite, and I think we actually did one on things to do with the dead body way back in the day. Oh yeah, we've talked a lot about this kind of stuff. But the notion that we're tackling today is that since the nineteen sixties and up until the nineteen sixties, Americans, uh and especially American Christian people had one kind of funeral and that was largely dictated um a k A. Shoved down our throats by the funeral industry. If you wanted to fit in in America, you had to to be presented upon your death in a certain way. That meant being embalmed, put in a suit or dress, whatever your preference was, um, and be presented in a casket usually open for like your friends and family to dress in black and come kind of grieve over you. And it's very solemn, unhappy affair. What was it When was the last time, not to get too personal, but that you had to go to an open cast it cast GT scene. I I don't remember, honestly. Um, it's been a while for me. Yeah, I genuinely don't remember because it is kind of like old school, you know, but you know, it still happens every once in a a while. I don't remember, Chuck, But I mean I have been ever since I was a little kid. My mom was like, it's time for you to learn about death, and I was like, I'm only two. She's like, yeah, it's a little late. Frankly. Yeah, all I know is the last few that I've been to, and in fact, most that I've ever been to, which I haven't been that many. I have always just been like, you know, like, do you want to go up and take good by to your grandmother? And I've always been like, no, I've done that in my head in my heart, so I do not need to go see that weird, powdery, waxy figure that looks nothing like her in real life. Do you want to go smell Grandma's hair one last time? God? Yeah, I've never been into it, and we're both kind of on record with that over our shows over the years. But uh, this whole thing started to kind of change with a book in nineteen sixty three that I kind of want to read now from Jessica Mitford called The American Way of Death, where she really kind of exposed, um, the US funeral home industry is being not so great. Yeah, Basically she she portrayed it as an entire industry built around taking um advantage of people in a really predatory way during a really um vulnerable moment, when they're grieving, when they're at their weakest. These these skills come in and start being like, well, of course you need this, and the deceased would want that, and the platinum packt ching cho ching cho ching, right, they got like the the cash registered dollars signed cartoon wolf Eyes. Um. That's basically how she portrayed and it was a really UM. I think she wrote an article at first and it got very little attention, and then it was turned into a book. I think she went on TV and it ended up becoming a book and really had a huge effect on how people viewed funerals from that point on. Yeah, and I guess maybe we should just caveat this now and say, if we have listeners that work in the funeral industry, we're not coming after you. Here. This was a book that was written in the nineteen sixties, and we realize it's a business for profit business, and up selling is part of that business, and it takes on a bit of a I guess, sort of an untoward feeling when it's dealing with people while they're grieving. But that's also the business you're in. So I'm not just I'm not slamming you if you work for If I have one across the street, they're very nice people. I live across from a funeral home. That's lovely. But um, having said that, stop it. No, things have changed a lot over the years. In the nineteen sixties, the cremation rate was three percent and which is astounding. And now it's fifty one percent, and it's going to go up to about fifty seven or fifty eight percent by two. It seems like yeah, and that that was a big effect that Mitford had with her book The American Way of Death. It was like like, you just did not get cremated before then, and then all of a sudden and she by the way, she she had a very cheap funeral, including being cremated. UM. I read that she spent less than I think eight hundred dollars in today's dollars um on her own funeral role um. But but because of this, it kind of made it like okay to not go through all this rigm roll and to not even like preserve the body. And I was reading about that preserving the body, like there's this idea that um that had been around for a really long time. Like I don't know if it was so that you looked your best when when God teld told everybody's staying up in their graves and be judged or apparent Yeah, yeah, okay. But apparently it was Abraham Lincoln that really kicked off the American trend for embalming. UM. He had his son embalmed. He was a big devotte of embalming. And then when he was embalmed and he made a whistle stop tour after death, that was like the first time a lot of Americans ever saw an embalmed body, and like it basically started this trend that lasted for a good century or more. Yeah, so let's take a break and we'll talk about kind of how this cultural shift fit in with all the other cultural shifts that were happening in the nineteen sixties right after this. Now I'm not large sk alright, so nineteen sixties come along. This book is written in the early sixties, the countercultural counterculture arrives, People start doing drugs, start exploring different kinds of spirituality, uh, including what they think about the afterlife, and sort of one of the natural things that happened was funerals started to change a little bit to compare, you know, to kind of lean towards more what we think of them uh today in today's terms. Yeah, that was a big part of it. You know, this this idea of um, you know, taking acid and thinking about being embalmed is not they don't really go hand in hand, you know what I'm saying it's a really easy way to decouple yourself from the traditional ideas of funerals is to take LSD. I only inject heroin into my body band exactly. So UM, that was a big part of it. In addition to Mitford's book, I think her book came at a really like good time. I think it had an impact because the general um awakening of people in the movement away from religion in a lot of ways, not necessarily away from spirituality. But um, you know, there's this guy that's interviewed in this house Stuff Works article who is the UM I think, the dean of religious studies at Emory University. So he's like, big Wood, you know what I'm saying, Gary Lotterman, And he points out that, UM that if you are talking about religion, like religions bread and butter, it's basic business is death in the afterlife. So it has all sorts of UM ideas and and um very clear guidelines about how you're supposed to behave upon death and how your body is supposed to be treated upon death, and if you're religious, you follow those. But if as a country America started to get less and less religious, those kind of constrictions fell away too. Yeah, and you know the idea that, um. The other thing a big thing that's changed and changed things funeral wise, is it used to be very vague in your will, Like funerals were just kind of done one way, so when you die, that was expected. And starting in the sixties and definitely in the past couple of decades, people have gotten way way more specific and they're what they want, like for their own funeral arrangements, and it's leaned more toward and they've even changed the nomenclature from funeral surface uh to memorial service and then eventually the celebration of life, and things have just gotten a lot less rigid, a little lighter, and more celebratory. I don't wear black, I want you to lay you know, uh, craft work, and I want alcohol served. And I wanted to be outdoors and scatter my ashes in my favorite dog park and then chuck. So if you're if you're running a funeral home these days, you're trying to keep up with this crazy changing wacko time um for how funerals are carried out or sorry, celebrations of life are carried out. Um, you you have to kind of get more creative now than you you did before. And I came across a blog post on funeral one dot com or funeral alone dot com, depending on how you want to say it, and it's I think like twenty something creative ideas for a funeral, and one of them, number ten, really sticks out to me. They now they point out, as long as it wasn't a tragic death, you can insert a bit of humor by um passing out mad libs for people to creative out the about the deceased. And I think it's smart of them to caveat that as long as it was a tragic loss, because that definitely does kind of change the tone of something even today, even in today's you know, whacked out alcohol fueled celebrations of life, if it's a tragedy that that led to the death, it's it's still going to be pretty somber. This is typically for things like, um, you know somebody who, um, I don't know where their death wasn't wasn't a tragedy. I don't think there's really any other way to put it or create create Number fourteen, create a memorial hashtag. Okay, so they give an example hashtag remembered Grandma Smith, but they've shortened Grandma to g M A so it could also be remembered good Morning America. I think it we settled on. I know you've changed your mind since then, but you were going to be shot out of a cannon or something. Yeah, And then I was always into this guy Burial, and Emily was just like, I'll make you into a tree, but I don't want to want vultures eating you. For God's sakes, Guy Burial is pretty hardcore man for sure. Um. Yeah, I used to to really be into myself, so I wanted to be shot out of a can, and now I'm like, I think I just rather be cremated and spread somewhere nice. Okay, So I've got one more for you. What you got um Number seventeen Celebrate Life fun with bubbles. So you know, basically, what they're saying is the funeral industry has gone into the wedding industry, wedding reception industry, and said we could translate a lot of these to these celebrations of life because they're both celebrations, and that's kind of where we're at with funerals right now. That's right, there's no wrong way to do it. If you are still into an open casket and that traditional funeral service, there certainly um businesses that can accommodate that. And we're not gonna yuck anyone's yum even in death. No, we're not, unless unless you fall for number eighteen, which is to host icebreaker games, which it doesn't matter whether it's a corporate function, a wedding or funeral. Icebreaker games are horrible. Everybody across the board just don't do that. No one wants you to go out like that. Well, since Chuck said we'll judge you for that, that means that short stuff is done and short stuff is out. Stuff you should know is production of iHeart Radios How stuff Works.
