Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast pre rap. I guess it's what you call that, a right, Chuck? Yeah, sure, prolog Forward is a good one. Um. I'm Josh and that's Chuck, and we are introducing a live podcast that we recorded in San Diego just a little while ago. Wait, July twelve, I think I don't remember. I believe it was the twelfth of July. It was great fun though. At common Con. Yeah, it was a big deal. Um, there were people who waited in line to get in. Some of those very people didn't get in got turned away to see us. That was weird. All those people were sorry for the people that came that weren't fans of the show, and if you happen to be listening now, then welcome and thank you for coming just out of interest. That was pretty weird, you know, to see people They're like, I don't know who these guys are, but it sounds interesting. Those were the three people who had their arms crossed in front of their chests. Yeah, expectantly and then disappointed. Um, so we're gonna just kind of get into this. If if anything seems out of place or you're freaked out by people laughing, just remember it's the recording of a live podcast. Jerry did a great job recording it, and um, so here's us doing time travel at Comic Con two thousand twelve. But those, if you don't know, we have a podcast called stuff. You know, it's on a website called how stuff dot com, our beloved website, and pretty soon we are going to be on the Science Channel too in January. Right, Um, time travel, Yeah, let's do Time Traveler. Everybody ready to learn a little bit about time travel. We're just gonna do our thing. We're recording this live. Everybody, say hi to everybody who's not here. For fans of the show, we have our producer, Jerry is actually here. I want to say hi Jerry. Alright, brass tacks, Jerry, did you press record yet? Okay? So we are recording kid alright, so um chuck, gosh, have you ever heard of a guy named Andrew Basaguel? I never know what to say here because I do, But should I say now? Just say maybe? Maybe? Okay? So let me tell you a little bit about this guy. All right. He's a Seattle attorney. Oh I know this guy, Okay, And ever since two thousand four has been talking publicly about how he was part of something that he says it was called Project Pegasus, which was supposedly a DARPA initiative for time travel. Yeah, the U. S. Government was using children because apparently children were specifically suited for time travel, which I didn't know more so than adults. We should say that this guy is the only source for this information. That's kind of a big qualifier, very much. Um. But so he does have a pretty good story, like Um. Throughout the seventies, from age seven to twelve, he uh did a lot of Lincoln assignments. I guess he traveled to Gettysburg at one point, um, where he was captured in a famous Josephine Cobb photograph. And I went and looked, and I mean it could be him. It's really blurry photographs. There were several guys, but it was from eighteen sixty three, so they didn't know what they were doing back then. Um. And then he also traveled a Ford Steater several times, where at one point he ran into another version of himself from another time that had traveled back there for that same night the Lincoln assassination, by the way, so um, and all of this, by the way, was based on technology that was made from schematics found among the personal effects um of Nikola Tesla, that's who died in New York. So supposedly the US government ransacked the department, came up with us bill these time portals. Now, far be it from me to cast this persions on another person's story, Chuck in. My motto is to each his own always. Yes, we should like clink swords when we say um. But I would buy this guy's story a little more if he said that he was traveling to the future. Because after researching for this presentation it's doing a little bit of time travel research, I found that there are a lot of bona fide, legitimate physicist cosmologists who say that, yes, it is entirely possible to travel to the future, and we kind of do it every day. It's pretty exciting. It's just yeah, it's it's true. Do you want to talk about it now? Yeah? You know, Josh, there's an old joke in the scientific community, in the time travel community, about a Let me see if I get this right about an immigrant who comes to the United States las I would, I imagine, and he lost he lost his watch. It's really sad. And he goes up to a science tis and he says, please, what's this time? I don't know what country that is. That's that's a general maybe European act. Okay, he's European. And the scientist replies, I'm sorry, you'll have to ask a philosopher. I'm just a physicist. Kind of a silly joke, a good time travel scientists. This kills it in lab rooms, but it is a silly joke, but it really gets to the heart of the matter. When you're talking time travel, it is very much a philosophical question, and it is Uh, if time flows like a river, like some people think, in one direction, Uh, the question is can you stop that flow, can you reverse that flow? Can you go back in time? Or can you speed up the flow and go forward in time? That's kind of the question. Yeah. I find it hardening to see like physicists and philosophers getting along having a beer talking about time traveler having their brains melt together. Um, and you were talking about time flowing like a river. Can I talk about my boy Stephen Hawking? Yeah? Sure, Do we have any Hawking fans in here? Same here? I love that guy. Yeah, he's my Hawking is my homeboy. Um. Stephen Hawking was talking about how he wrote this this really great article or essay or whatever you want to call it for the Daily Mail of all people, UM about time travel, and then he talks about time as a river. He says, it's very poetically. It's like a river because it flows in one direction, you know, and we're all just kind of going along with it. But it's also a bit like a river in that UM in different spots, it travels at different speeds, and if we can figure out how to exploit those different spots, then we can get to like the brass texts of time travel. Yeah, Hawking basically thinks you can travel into the future. All you have to go is really really, really really fast. And we're talking, uh, I think the stat is the fastest thing ever was Apollo ten yea thousand miles an hour. That's very very fast. If you want a time travel wall, Hawking says, you need to go two thousand times faster than that. That's really fast man interject something. Sure, I actually did the math, and Hawking got his math wrong way tim from what he goes on to say that you need to get very close to the speed of light. You have to go like twenty thousand times more, not two thousands. So I just corrected. Homeboy been hawking and it's math. And I hope he doesn't hear this because there will be a SmackDown afterward. I'm sure be like, oh, you know math, huh well. And one of the big problems with going that fast is fuel. In order to go that fast, you need a humongous ship that can carry fuel enough to travel. I think he said six years, like ramping it up speed wise, right, And that's not very likely at least any time. You would need the seed ship to go towards the speed of light, accelerating constantly for six years. And then like the fourth year you'd started time travel, could you hit speed of light which is like six d million miles an hour pretty fast? Um? And then I think at that point time goes um an hour on the ship equals two hours back on Earth, so you're starting to travel into the future relative to the Earth. Right. Then after another two years, you get to like the speed of light, which is like six hundred and sixty. That's when like a day, is it a day? A day on the ship equals like a year on Earth, which okay, then that's that's time travel. It's that's very very fast. And if you turned around and went back to Earth, you could be like, check me out, I'm from the past. Because really, this is another thing I figured out from from researching. This is time travel is really it doesn't matter if you don't have anyone to show it off to, Like you can go travel out and outer space as long as you want and live forever. But if no one's there to see it, who cares? You know? Exactly the philosopher's exactly. Yeah, So you go ahead. Are we at Carl Sagan or yeah, okay, that's always a great question to ask, are we at Carl Sagan? So Carl Sagan, who's my homeboy, has a viewpoint that sort of body slams the skeptics of the world. And I know there are skeptics, and skeptics like to unite and tell people things a lot with great vigor, but I am not one. I've always been more of a molder than a scully you know what I'm saying, And uh yeah, thank you for that. And here's what Carl Sagan has to say, because basically what skepticals say is, well, if you can dime travel, then why aren't we always visited by time travels all the time? That's skeptics. That's what skeptics sound like. I think we just said a skeptical form there than and Dunning, he's gone. Uh So Carl Sagan has this to say about gonna read it because I cannot summarize it any better than he says it. He says, first of all, it might be that you can build a time machine to go into the future but not into the past, and we don't know about it, but couzy, because we haven't yet invented that time machine. Little brain melting, but it makes sense. Secondly, it might be that time travel into the past is possible, but they haven't gotten to our time yet. They're just really far into the future. And the further back in time you go, the more expensive it is. That when I'm a little bit like a little economics into it. Uh. And then thirdly, maybe backward time travel is possible, but only up to the moment that time travel is invented, so we haven't invented it yet, so it can't come to us. We are s o l So that is like, yeah, you need to be drinking something to understand that. Uh so No, not really, not really. He's just saying like maybe there's like a like you just can't go back beyond the point where time travel is invented. He's just being a rabble rouser. And the final thing he says is there's a possibility that time travel is really perfectly possible, but it requires such a great advance on our technology that the human civil is Asian will destroy itself before they can invent it. That's the gloom and Doom one exactly. But and segands raising all these points to say, like, you know, if somebody's saying, if time travel is possible, where are all the time travelers? And he's saying, hey, hey man, keep an open mind. That's what he used to say. And put on this turtleneck, right, let's all just wear turtlenecks. Everyone will mellow out. And I like Carl Sagan. And there was one other thing about um hawkings view. He made a good point where if you aren't a show off, and you don't need to time travel just to impress your friends in the future. Um, you could use the same ship that's going super super fast towards the speed of light to just go to other parts of the Milky Way. It would come in handy very much for these long distance trips. Right. So, UM, say you wanted to make it to the iryan Nebula, you could do this several foul goption Chucks come in, Man, you hear something, Joshing Chuck, come in this time pilot John Hodgman speaking to you from the future. Hey, Hogy, she probably shouldn't be talking to me because I can't hear you. This is a time message. It only goes in one direction backwards, and I'm not even sure that I reached you. It all depends on if I got the time coordinates correct time coordinates by the way, just latitude and longitude and altitude and time. But listen, Josh and Chuck, if you're getting this message, I need you to do something. Things have gone horribly wrong and this time stream and it's all because of something that happens at comic conve that you are intimately involved with. Basically, you piss off John Sweden because you's already pressn't so I urge you look at a picture of John Sweden and don't piss him off, because if you do, he gets so angry and he hates podcasts and then he becomes a dictator and and stops making movies. But if you recognize him, I guarantee you he will make um another season of Firefly completely. Also, Josh and checked that person in the Wookie costume is not a Wookie. H Okay, Well, I hope that fixes everything. It's really not good here in the future, so I hope you can fix it. I also hope that this message went to my time stream in the past and didn't get booted off to another multiverse, in which case is this is reaching you in a different multiverse. Watch out for the flood and ghostly piranha um. They will eat your face off. All right, I've got to go. It's all the time I have so to speak. Time pilot John Hodgman from Unnamed Future signing off goodbye and wow, I was a guy. He is always looking out or you never know when the future John Hodgman is going to pop in. Does anyone know what Joss Wheden looks like, Okay, we need to pick later. He's not here. Is anyone going to the firefly panel? Yeah, you better go get in lined right after this? Yeah, which we should we talk about methods of time travel? Maybe? Oh yeah, go ahead. Okay, So if you're talking time travel, which we are, Uh, there are two directions. You can go go into the future or you can go into the past. I'm a past guy. I'd always like to see the Old West. You were going to see Old West? Well, I just want to be a gun slinger. Yeah, and we're less right. But if you want to advance into the future, here's what you're gonna have to do. You're gonna have to exploit uh, spacetime, which isn't the easiest thing in the world, but it's possible. It actually happens every day up in the sky with GPS satellites. I don't know that guy's nodding, he knows, uh, But many of you may not know that these satellites actually a crew an extra third of a billionth of a second every day. It doesn't sound like much, but it's time trouble and it's kind of cool. And the reason this happens is time passes faster in orbit. Uh. Down here on Earth. Basically, Earth is like a big dope st Bernard like dragging on time, and all the mass on Earth is just slowing down time in little tiny increments. Out there in deep space, you don't have to worry about that kind of thing. And that's called gravi gravitational time dilation, and it's a real thing. Uh, and we observe this all the time scientists. Two astronomers do UH. When they see light in deep space. They'll see light moving in uh in a straight line, and if it gets close enough to a sufficiently large object like say Sagittarius A, which have which has the mass of four million sons, time will actually bend and they see this, and it's called the gravitational lensing effect. So uh, if you were to, let's say, travel to Sagittarius A and circle it is black hole and if you don't fall in, which would be bad, Actually it might be pretty cool. It would be really what would be bad. There's a word for it, like what happens to you kind of It's called spaghettification, like the the infinite density of the center of a black hole. Just finge you out into a spaghetti version of yourself that is not alive anymore. Could use that actually would be a good look. So, um, if you were to be able to circle sagittaries a for a little while, uh without falling in, you would experience time at half the rate on Earth, which is time trouble again, and you come back to Earth and you show off for everybody. Yeah, and that's basically the center of this sagittary, say, is a really super dense point. It's called a singularity. But don't confuse that with the singularity, two very different things. That's a that's another big future problem. Yeah, I'll be in big trouble at the singularity. Yet, Can I throw out some of my favorite, um, please, universal cosmic anomalies? So Chuck was talking about a black hole. Um, one of my favorites is called the carring or curring. We can't figure out how you say it. Honestly, we looked, We really looked, so probably for the rest of the time when I say it, I'm gonna say curring or carring, Okay, okay, um. And basically, this is like a black hole that forms from a lot of neutron stars that have collapsed, and neutron stars are about the size of Manhattan, but they have like the mass of our sun, so they're super dense, and a bunch of will form into this ring that kind of turns into this whirlpool um and because of the centrifugal force of these things, they're a singularity doesn't form. Hence spaghettification doesn't befall you when you go through the center of these things. But it's still a black hole, right. They think that if you go through, though, it's a one way ticket because probably on the other side is what's called a white hole, which is the opposite of a black hole, and it pushes light and matter out away from it, so there's no way of getting back. But it's still possible that you can travel through time at the very least to another part of space. Yeah. Right, So you want me to tell you about another one, Well, this next one is my favorite. Oh, the the Einstein rosen Bridge, which wow, that got applause. Yeah, and here comes the rest also known as a wormhole. Yeah, but everyone calls it a wormhole because like you couldn't have a TV show called Through the Einstein rosen Bridge with Morgan Freeman. I guess you could. But through the wormhole with Morgan Freeman is like catchy, right, it's sexy. It is very sexy, super sexy. Um. And so an Einstein rosen bridge or a wormhole. Uh, it's it's kind of actually easy to grasp if if you consider time or space spacetime, it's like a flat sheet that you fold it in half and you left some space in between, right, and then you have a sheet if you want to demonstrate, do you I like this? Uh? And then gravity is pushing towards the center, towards this empty space in the middle. So if you have the sheet like that and you put like a baseball on either side, these depressions are going to form that are kind of akin to um, the bending of time time delation, gravitational time delations thing. And if the depressions that they form connect, you've got a wormhole. Boom. Yeah, and you may be able to travel through this. No one knows for certain, but it's this kind of like the physicist or at the point now where they're like, oh, and there's also this other weird thing and maybe you can travel through time and that is that what they say, that's kind of what they say. But so, Chuck is an Old West kind of time travel guy. I like time travel of the past two UM. I tend to think the time travel of the future is the one we're gonna accomplish first. But the reason most physicists pooh poo the idea of traveling back in time is because paradoxes our eyes. And when a paradox arises, usually that means like the point is moot, Like you can't argue it any further with a learned person. Yeah, we uh. This is a point where we talk about something called causality. And everything we know here on planet Earth, as I say, is based on and in a time sense, it's based on cause and effect, and it's a one way street. Something happens first and that leads to something that happens after. You can't have something. You can't have an effect without the cause, right, And it's a one way street going then in that direction, cause effect, cause effat, cause effects cause out and you have um. One of the big, great famous paradoxes is the grandfather paradox. Right, the status of all paradoxes, which is it kind of demonstrates Yeah, this bums Chuck out because the grandfather is like, it's like, what the grandfather do you know? Um? But let's say that you went back to kill your grandfather, right, you're an assassin. Maybe you'll do anything for money, a looper if you will. And uh, And you go back and you you walk up to your grandfather and you shoot him and kill him dead. But this is the vision of your grandfather before he's conceived your father. Therefore you can't possibly exist. Therefore, how could you get back to time travel in the first place to kill yourself? That's so sad, it is, said the grandmother. Paradox, that's where you go back. And they couldn't call it that they did. They tried it and they were like, go back and kill your grandmother? Are you serious? They're like, can you just call a grandfather at least because maybe he hits you once or something. You know, at the very least he made you mow the lawn for a nickel or something. Yeah, grandmother just caddles you and pet you chicken and pie or at least mine. Did you miss you miss Granny Bryant? Don't you do? Um? Although she lived to be a hundred I know that's a right hold age. That's a right poled age. Um, that's called a sidebar. There's also so that's a that's an inconsistent uh, inconsistent cause of loop night. My favorite is the consistent cause a loop. Yeah, this is pretty cool because it's paradox free, which means it could actually happen. And there's a physicist named Paul Davies who describes it like this. Let's say a math professor travels into the future and steals this really valuable math theorem. Then he goes back to the past and he gives theorem to a student, and that student ends up growing up to be the very person he stole it from. Everyone's going pretty awesome. No one dies in paradox free, right. My favorite example of this, though, is, um, well, we have a special guest here named Brian who's gonna help us with this. Come on up here, Brian. Everybody give Brian a round of applause. So this is Brian. He's going to read to us an example, an explanation of probably the coolest example of a consistent causal loop. So Brian, will you take it away? Probably the best demonstration of a consistent causal loop is found in the film Back to the Future. Towards the end of the movie, Marty McFly performs Johnny be Good on his guitar during the enchantment under the Sea Dance. His playing catches the attention of one Marvin Barry, cousin of the famed musician Chuck Berry. His interest, Pete Marvin calls Chuck Berry to alert him to this unusual sound, which prompts we must assume Chuck Berry to write and record Johnny Be Good. But since he is from the future, we must assume that Marty McFly learned to play the song Johnny Be Good in his own time based on the song recorded by Chuck Berry years in the past. This is impossible, however, because it was Marty McFly's performance of Johnny Be Good that prompted its creation. This paradox, where the origination of a thing comes as the result of time travel, violates the law of causality a truly important lie. Indeed, it's true that we could have also cited the Pocket Watch and the Christopher Reave movie Somewhere in Time as an example, but Back to the Future was a way better movie. All right, right, very much time, Nicety Good? Thanks well down, to and then the final possibility, uh is my favorite one, which is many worlds, parallel universes. You can times. I saw some head nods. People love that one because he can time travel all over the place. Man, And you're just create separate timelines and you're in many different sandboxes, and it just doesn't even matter, right because if you go back and kill your grandfather in another version of the universe where you weren't born, who cares? Who cares? Man, because I'll just go in another timeline. Do you know why are you talking like that? Because that's what they hit these like, Man, Yeah, are you do you want to stumma? I guess in summation. You know, we certainly don't know if it's for sure possible, but I think it's important to ask these questions. You know, with people like Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan and sixth century philosophers are talking about slowing down time and speeding up time, then it's worthwhile to me, agreed, And that's a That is our presentation on time travel. Thanks so um, I think we're about out of time unless we have a few minute for Q and A. Do we one question? Let's do one question? Let's do too quick. Your hand up, there's a microphone right there. Nice rocket. Have either of you ever wanted to be on Celebrity Jeopardy so you could just smoke them? Thank you? I would love to be on Jeopardy. I don't know if we qualified for Celebrity Jeopardy yet, but I used to sit around in college all the time and play with my roommates. Uh and I did pretty well. I thought. I think that the X factor is whether or not you freeze on TV. So one more, one more bam in the hat in the back baseball hat. You just yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you for John. Hello. H question, do you are you guys gonna like do books like you know, how do you have the little books so and all this stuff? Are you gonna like release those eventually or do you plan on it? We have two audio books which are like books, but they're way easier than um. But yeah, that's stuff. We've definitely talked about that before, like we're still trying to figure out what the idea would be behind it, but um, yes, we're definitely not opposed to that. So look for in like maybe yes, we get all time job there right now exactly so um, let's see. If you want to get in touch with us, you can tweet to us on s Y s K podcast, you can visit us on Facebook dot com, and you can always send us a good old fashioned email by wrapping it up, spanking it on the bottom and sending it off to Stuff Podcast at Discovery dot coms and very much everybody for more on this and thousands of other topics, does it how stuff works dot com h brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camry. It's ready, are you
