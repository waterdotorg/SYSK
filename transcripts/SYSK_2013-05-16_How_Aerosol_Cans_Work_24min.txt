Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W Chuck Bryant, and this is Stuff you Should Know podcast. Yeah, what are you excited about this one? I'm going to try to be excited for everybody enough for everybody, because I imagine, like there's a you know, there's a lot of people out there who don't listen to every single episode. I just I find it biting in weird because I do that with my podcast. So if I'm like, if I'm listening to like if I look at Mark Marrin', so I listen to that one. If it's a guest that I'm not super into, I want right, that's other podcasts. I'm talking about Stuff you Should Know. Man, you must be confused. Yes, I feel like every single one of them is worth listening to. I agreed. I suspect though, that people are going to skip over this one. Well, I am going to take the rap because I picked this out. I like it, but as I looked into it, I was like, you know what, I don't know how an aerosol can work, and I would like to and it's not super complicated. It's not. In a matter of fact, now that you read this and researched it, you understand how an aerosol can works. You can go to the hardware store on a Saturday when your board is just stand around and explain it to people and get like applause. I could do that. Every anyone who listens to this episode will be able to do the same thing. That would be like ACE Hardware, and there'll be some seventy five year old guy with the red vest next to me. Like all piste off, they always have old timer's working there. Well. They are big on keeping the economy going on the backs of aged baby boomers and that there's a slogan, Yeah, I think it's ACE is the place. Well, you have to read between the line, Um, chuck. Have you ever seen a movie called Style Wars. It's a documentary from Uh no, I haven't. It's pretty cool man. It's it basically arnicles the the rise of graffiti, hip hop, clothing and stuff, and break dancing, just that whole culture. And it's amazing the stuff that people were doing, like even back then as far as graffiti goes, and breakdancing and hip hop and all that, sure, but it's just like the seminal documentary that you just kind of have to see. It's just so cool. It's like it kind of makes you feel cool watching it, you know what I mean? Well, I need that in my life. But the what the reason I raised style Wars is because the graffiti that was being carried out would not have ever been able to be done had it not been for a Norwegian engineer named Eric Rothheim who in put in the first patent for an aerosol can in Norway and then five years later the first one in the US. Yeah, and they had the little photo of some of his initial drawings, and the author of this article points out that although it has evolved somewhat, it's he's He was pretty right on with that first, is right, you know, almost out of the gate, because as we said, it's kind of simple. The Yeah, one of them was simple to me. One of them I didn't quite understand. Well, okay, so um so Rothheim he comes up with this, this patent files, it kicks back and waits for the money to come rolling in, but it doesn't. It took many many years or so maybe a little less before anyone fully understood the value of an aerosol can, and it was um insecticides, bug bombs, cans of um insects spray that was being used by soldiers in the Pacific and World War Two. When people finally said, oh, that is a good idea. Yeah, I wonder if I mean they had atomizers and things at the time. I wonder if that was his initial inspiration was to take that concept and jam it into a can basically, because that's what's going on. Yeah, you're atomizing product. Yeah, and there's a lot of um advantages to atomizing. Number one, if you spray something in a fine mist, it doesn't hit the ground. Is a bunch of liquid that seeks into the groundwater usually sticks to whatever you're spraying it to. Sure, and it's delightful if you wear perfume or have you ever like had the rose water sprayed on your face, like the face sprays. Oh, I thought you meant like an aerosol can of perfect no atomizing in general? Yeah, sure, sure, I'm fresh. I've I've had an avian sprits sprayed on my face. You mean I have before? It's very nice. Yeah, I've had like the rosewater. Emily will spraying me occasionally. It's very nice. It just feels good. Does she like hide behind around a corner and yeah, no, that's the mace. Oh she mazes me occasionally for kicks. Um. So yeah, there's advantages to atomizing things. There's reasons. It's at the very least it's lovely. It is um and the whole premise behind this though, the delivery method of an aerosol can Like we said, it's very basic, it's very old, and all you have to do is understand a little bit about fluid dynamics to to get what's going on. So let's let's do let's give a brief prime around fluid dynamic shall yeah, and fluid period Like you know, fluid isn't necessarily liquid like you might think it's an actual thing. Fluid is any kind of substance that has free flowing particles that it's made up of that and it could be something liquid, could be something gas that those are both fluids. It just can't be a solid basically pretty much. Yeah, yeah, as long as you got those free flowing particles. Um, these particles, uh, if it's a liquid, they're loosely bound, but they're still bound. So it means it's gonna have a fixed volume if it's a liquid. Yeah, which is why, like when you put water into a glass, it doesn't just keep going and going and going. That'd be terrifying. No, it would make it. It would have a gaseous um characteristic. Then that's right, because gas does expand to fill the volume that you put it in. That's right, and well, spoiler or that's what happens with gas. It expands. Uh, if you heat liquid um applying energy to it, basically it's gonna vibrate and it's gonna break those forces and they're not gonna be bound together anymore. Then you're gonna have a gas. And that's called boiling. Yeah. And I mean we think of boiling is like applying enough heat that you will burn your skin. But boiling points vary for different types of fluids. Um. So any volatile fluid is a fluid that um boils or turns from a liquid state to a gasy state. That's boiling um at room temperature, right, Yeah, Which that that's the part I had a hard time getting my head around because I associate boiling with like heat and hot. Yeah. Because you think of boiling, you think of water, Yeah, exactly. And it takes a certain amount of temperature, of heat of heat energy to break those intermolecular bonds to turn water from a liquid into a gas, that's right. But it takes less for alcohol or for propane or whatever you want to use. Right. And so lastly there's another fluid dynamic trait that we have to have down and then we'll have all of the stuff in place to understand an aerosol can expansion of gas. Yeah, So so we said that when you put gas into something and expands to fill the volume, Yeah, and gas will decrease in pressure as it expands, which is why like a tiny little CEO two cartridge, it's like got tons of pressure in there, and that's why it can shoot your awesome industrial arts model car down the track. Because did you ever do that? Really? I had a Pinewood Derby racer once. What's that like the car you sit in? No, that's the cub scout car. Okay, it didn't have any CEO two though you'd be immediately disqualified. Yeah. In high school, we we made the little cars that have the CEO two cartridge in the battle. I know what you're talking about. And we raced each other and my brother one county of course, and then and then flashed this winning smile, and three years later, it's so funny. I forgot all about this. I tried to be his car design when I took the class, and mine was not nearly as like, it just wasn't quite right, and I didn't win county. I didn't even win my classroom. Somehow, the the compressed air decompressing into the atmosphere made like a sad trombo and sad is it so cool? And that really kind of just sums it all up with my brother and I. He was always really great at stuff, and I always tried to do that and was not nearly as good at it. You're good at other things. Well, I'm yeah, I can run my mouth, if that's how you want to put it. Anyway, So that's compressed gas. And when gas is compressed, it can you know, do some great things like shoot the car or in this case, spray paint or something. Right, right, exactly, Okay, So you have compressed gas, you have all these fluid dynamics, and you've had everyone now right, Okay, So all an aerosol can is is all of these principles kind of put into a very simply mechanically functioning state. Right. Yeah. So you have a can and you have to to things in there. You have the propellant, which is the stuff you use to force the other thing, the product out. Yeah. And it could be hair spray, bug spray, could be painting oil, could be that foamy stuff you ever use that, the stuff to like seal like insulation or sure or like fix the flat. All that, all that has myriad myriad uses. Okay, right, So, um, you've got the product in liquid state. Yes, uh say, it's just kind of floating in the bottom of the can. You put it in the can, seal it so it's there's there's no air going it's air tight. Yeah, this is part one. There's two two ways to do this. This is the first, right, This is the simple way. And then you add some sort of compressed air to it, call it air compressed air. Okay, okay. So you have this um the propellant in there, and it's it's basically filling up as much of it as it can until it's reaching the top of the can, the side of the can, in the top of the water, and it pushes all that product down to the bottom, which is one reason you gotta shake it chack it up exactly. So you have a tube going down from the nozzle at the top of the can valve system all the way down to the bottom of the can where the liquid is right and that look, that valve has a seal that's being pushed up by a spring. So the head the nozzle when it's when it's not being pushed, it's stealed tight. But when you push it down a channel opens. It goes below the seal and you now have the outside atmosphere, which is at a much lower pressure than inside the can um opened up to the inside of the can at that much higher pressure, and it drives it up the tube out the little tiny, tiny hole which atomizes it. And that's basically the simpler method of the aerosol can. Yeah. The air pushes the liquid down and then up the tube. Yeah, because it's like I want to get out too exactly. It expands. Done. I mean that's pretty easy. Yeah. So the second way that this can happen, and I didn't know this is the more common way, but it is. Uh they use liquified gas, so uh, that is the propellant. You've still got the same product. And the product is is sitting there at room temperature just fine as a liquid. So they just pour that in. Then they steal it up, and then the same way with the other way. They pump in this liquefied gas and it mixes though this time, right or does it press it down? This is where I got a little confused. So a liquefied guess you said, is um, it's a gas that goes into a liquid state under a certain amount of pressure, right, yeah, okay, so under high pressure. Yeah, so it does mix because it's all liquid in there. Once it gets in there, the whole thing turns liquid, and you keep that pressure up so it doesn't have any room to expand, so it's just in their mix together. And then when you press the nozzle down own and you break the seal as it were, um, the you form a channel with the outside air and the inside air. That change in pressure converts some of that propellant into gas, and it does the same thing is that standard can. The gas presses down forces the liquid up, but some of that propellant is still in liquid form mixed with the product, and as it goes out, it evaporates, it turns into gas, and it also kind of um, it turns that liquid product into a finer miss. Yeah. But what I don't get is is that it actually boils in the liquid gas system. It's like, once you relieve that pressure, it starts to boil, and that's what does it. That's what I was a little confused about. Yeah, I have a feeling that this is a different part of fluid dynamics, that it's not necessarily the boiling point, although it could be, because I don't think any average gas turns into a liquid under under all under pressure. There's just certain kinds that do. I think. Okay, so I think, what's your question, Well, it's actually boiling in the second in the in the liquid gas type of aerosoli, at the very least, it's converting into a gassy estate because of the release of pressure, right, all right? And why did they can sometimes get cold? Did you figure that out? Okay? Boy, there's some guts. There's some people in chemistry lab right now that are just like, oh my god, you guys, I thought we had this one, man. I think we had we do I had it, and I could have done a tap dance doing this earlier, and now it's like, but wait, let me complicate it a little more. Now, I think it's I think the message got through. Um. If in the case of paint, sometimes you need a little help mixing these things together. So that's why a paint can, spray paint can will have the little metal ball bearing on the inside, right, because you actually do want to mix the propellant and the product together in a liquefied can, liquefied gas can, right, because it helps atomize it. As you said, that's very pleasant, exact. Um, what about the rounded bottom of this very can you know why that's that way? If it was flat, it's so pressurized, it could be a bad scene. It could actually go the other way. And everyone knows if you studied architecture, that a dome is more structurally sound than just a flat surface. So that's basically the same concept at play. So that's one reason, Um, it's to protect the integrity of the can. And the second one is is so you can help get all of the product out, because if it was flat, it's like when you're down at the bottom of your of your soda cup with your straw and you're making that terrible little noise and you're tilting the cup and trying to stick the straw on the little corner where it meets the edge. This does it for you. If it's a rounded bottom, it just puts all the product there at the edge and that's where the little tube is, and so you're all set. Yeah, And did you know there's about nineteen billion steel and aluminum cans that include aerosols and other products that are recycled every year and that's equal to enough to build twenty golden gate bridges. Wow, isn't that amazing? So we mentioned there's a variety of different products that you can have that you're trying to get out of your can, from foam to like whipped cream to a bug spray, stuff like that hair spray, although does anyone still use aerosol hair spray? I think some people do, is it? Remember? Do you remember the Bizarre Ways to Die episode? The deodorant boy asol deodorant that he died totally man, that was a long time ago. Um. So the way they accomplished this though with a different product, um is you can have a variety of consistencies. And what they do is they just play with, UM, the ratio propellant to product. Maybe maybe the chemical makeup of the propellant the product have to be just right. Maybe the pressure of the propellant has to be a little different depending on what kind of product you're working with. And then um, the size and shape of the valve system. Like in the case of a fix, the flat that you put in your higher it's not the same as you know, a spray can. It's not atomizing. It's got like the tube hooked up and it's Uh. If you've ever sprayed that stuff in your house, like the Philip Crack, like a whole can of it, It's amazing how much stuff is packed in there. Like when it gets out, you're just like wow, it's like the clown car of the industrial engineering scene. Um, do you want to know a little bit about CFC's chlorofluora carbons. Yeah, I didn't get a chance to look into this, but I'm glad you did so. Prior to the late twenties, there was people were using ammonia and refrigerators and dying from ammonia leaks, and it was just a bad scene. And so everybody said, well, we've got to figure out some sort of toxic, non toxic chemical that we can use as a refrigerant, and a general motors engineer of all people came up with what du Pont later turned into free on, a chlorofluora carbon which supposedly was non toxic. It was. It basically changed everything. Um it was much less harm harmful compared to like ammonia. UM. It allowed us to make cheap refrigerators, car A C, A C window units, like all those things came from the advent of chlorofluora carbons, right, And it was also very ubiquitous as a propellant in aerosol can sprays. Well. I think that's why everyone, you know quit using aquinette, right, because everybody was going in the spraying these things, and they were going up in the atmosphere, and everyone was like, look at them. Go it's cool. They're like, you know, innert, non toxic chemicals going up in the atmosphere, but we're all getting cancer. The problem is when a CFC enters the atmosphere and gets high enough and it's exposed to UV radiation, it breaks down and into its constituting components, one of which is chlorine, chlorine reeks, havoc on the ozone layer. One atom of chlorine can destroy about a hundred thousand ozone molecules, and we need those molecules. The ozone layer protects us from UVB ray from the sun, which are they kind of give you skin cancer and destroyed crops. So in nineteen seventy four some scientists realized that CFCs were doing this in the ozone layer and is gonna be big trouble. And then in the eighties we figured out that there's a hole in the ozone layer over the Arctic. So, uh, a bunch of countries I think seventies signed on to basically outlaw CFC production. Yeah, and then later on another like hundred and twenty I think signed another treaty. So it's very very difficult to find CFC's these days. But they're still around, are they. Yeah? They still use them in some um nasal sprays UM and they're also used in halan, which is a fire extinguisher for airplanes. Did they not still use free on? No? I don't believe. So, Okay, Yeah, it's basically like we did away with those. It's gonna take a while to repair. But they found that the ozone layers no longer growing the hole in the ozon layers growing, it's just holding steady and hopefully patching itself back up. They just forced people to go out and be innovative and find different ways to do these things exactly. And if you compare your airsol can propellant today to one that had CFCs before, you're not going to notice the least bit different. So that's canna aquinit that looks exactly the same as it did in nineteen seven is no longer dangerous, not to the ozone layer. It is the spiders though, if you have a lighter. Yeah, don't ever do that. Kids. Ah, that's it for airsol cans unless you have like another ten minutes on it. Uh No, that's all I got. I mean, what else is there? I genuinely looked in There is nothing else. Ye, go out and do some graffiti, That's what I say. Um artful graffiti though, don't tagg and stuff. You should probably practice at home first. I hate that. Just stupid. Yeah, Like, educate yourself on different types of nozzles, like practice, don't do don't be a punk, agreed, be an artiste. Uh. If you we want to learn more about aerosols, or at the very least, want to see the article where we told you everything there is to know about aerosolis. You can type that word A E R O S O L S into the search bar how stuffworks dot com and that will bring it up. And I said the search bar, which means it's time for message break and now it's time for listener mail. I thought you might say it, okay, Josh, listener mail time. UM, I'm gonna call this uh police sketch eye witnessed stuff. It's from Terry Bennett. Um, Hey, guys, uh listen to the police Sketch episode, and wanted to share my story. I was robbed when I was a teller of a bank in n and at that time, bank robbery was a federal crime, probably still is. I was immediately taken into the back room of the vault and the FBI was called in. When they arrived, a sketch artist brought a large binder, not full of women, but full of pictures. They aces and eyes and noses and mouths, et cetera. Transparencies of face shapes were the base, and the rest of the face was built on the base, one eye and nose at a time. UM I was not allowed to talk to anyone, including the staff of my bank, until I talked to the FBI. I was instructed to write everything I could remember about the robber and the robbery before talking to anybody else. In those days, of course, we did not have digital cameras in the film had to be sent out for processing. Um, all of it in those days. I mean, it's the same like seven years ago. Um. Actually when did digital come around? The early two thousands? Seems like it became. I guess it's more than seven three years on. So uh. The pictures took a couple of days to get back, and my composite drawing was posted in the paper, and my robber was actually caught a couple of days afterward at a methodon clinic in town. When the film was developed, the side by side pictures were incredibly closed. So she did for good job. Sounds like, by the way he was caught using my composite and not the true picture. We're pretty cool. Yeah, it's very cool. We were trained to observe all these details and also to watch for the six ft mark as the robber left the building. And you talked about the call it stores. Yeah, Um, I guess I visit banks. Luckily, even though I was only twenty years old, the training had taken a hold gave me great resources to catch this guy. And to this day, I always observed shady or odd things in everyday life, including license plates like you talked about. By the way, my robber had robbed eight other banks up and down the coast in California. And I got to be a hero for a minute. And that is Terry Bennett. And that's a cool story. Yeah, that's very cool, Terry. Um, thanks for Sharon. I bet she just eyeballs everybody, right, Yeah, she said that like a weird lady. Now she takes out methodon clinics. Yeah, what are you doing? Just getting the methodone. If you want to give us a story, we love our stories. Um, you can tweet very very very short story to us at s y s K podcast. That's our Twitter handle.
