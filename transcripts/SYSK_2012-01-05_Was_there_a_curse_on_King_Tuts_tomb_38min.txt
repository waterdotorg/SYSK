Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant and makes this stuff you should know the podcast. I'm walking like an Egyptian Worth. You nailed that too, Jerry and now were singing the old Steve Martin King tut song and you were like, what is that? I know what it is? And I'm young. I don't know that. I don't know the lyrics. Yeah, you were. You were on the cusp there, that was. That was a big deal when I was a kid, And I was like to when I think when that came out? Yeah, he missed it by a few years. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't like twenty five and going to see Steve Martin or anything, what I like sixty. So, Chuck, I know you're familiar with Steve Martin, but are you familiar with a little boy king by the name of King two tongue common, Yes, I am, are you? Yeah, Well, let's wrap about him. Man, did you go see the exhibit? No? No, the Discovery one in Times Square. Well it travels you know. Oh yeah, no, you we saw that one. I didn't see it though it saw bodies, so that was pretty neat. I think I told you about that. I didn't see bodies yet. I did the dialogue in the Dark. Yeah, we talked about this. Yeah, bodies was pretty cool. But you're like, wow, this is really nuts. Yeah, um, but no, I didn't see King Tych did you? Did you know there's a Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit now in Times Square? Discovery has you know, Discovery has like this basically like a museum, like an exhibition show in Times Square and the newest one is the Dead Sea Scrolls. Like the Dead Sea Scrolls are there in Times Square right now. You can sign your name on it, right Yeah, all right, Well let's get back to King Tut because we got a little off topic. If you ask me, um, I'm gonna tell you what I know about King Tutt, and then you tell me what you know and we'll combine the two. So like, for example, um, I found out that King Tut was an Avid chariot racer. Did you know that he was buried apparently in tombed I should say, with six chariots. It's kind of like you're uber wealthy boy president, right, who's like sixteen and then you know dies at a eighteen is buried with like his eight camaros or something. That's kind of what they did with King Tutt. He was also an avid ostrich hunter. He used to hunt in the desert with just him and his dog. Is pretty cool. Um. He also married his sister and had two babies with their both of the both of which were um born prematurely and dyed. Yeah, there's a lot of inbreeding going on back then. Yeah, there's a lot of rumors that he was in bred, or a lot of speculation or I should say a lot of factual conjecture that he was him self also inbred. Um. And they think that there's this huge mystery going on right now that he was club footed. Did you know that. I did not know that. So they think that he may have been club footed, which would definitely support the inbreeding UM argument, not that people who have club feed are inbred, but I think if you are inbred, you're likelier to have something like a club foot. But they can't tell. It looks like he's club footed, but his his cadavers. Corpse has been so mistreated over the decades since it was discovered that, Um, they can't tell if somebody just broke his foot or if he was born that way club foot? Is that all yet? Yeah, that's all right, we should boy it. Uh. He was short. He had a weird shaped head. Have you ever seen a skull? Uh, it's it looks like an egg. It's really weird looking. And they measured it and found that it just qualifies as quote normal. But he Uh. All all the paintings back then showed all the pharaohs and the Egyptian pharaohs had these weird shaped heads, and they thought, well, those are just the artist. But then they found his skull and they're like, no, he has a weird shape dead. So Eric van Daeken here would say something like, well, it's because aliens came down and bred with them. The guy who wrote um Highways of the Gods, I believed that Runways of the Gods basically the seventies dude who who printed all these books basically saying that the ancient Egyptians were in contact with aliens of them all this stuff, and there's all this evidence throughout like hieroglyphics and things like you know, two tone commons, skull or whatever that show that Aliens came down and bred with the Egyptians, and that's how human civilization just advanced by leaps and bounds. I believe it already just from that. Anybody who it's like their acupuncture podcast came back, weren't just turned that off at the mention of his name. Yeah, exactly. So let's talk a little bit about how he died though, because that's the big you know, we know that he ruled, he was the boy king from nine to nineteen and then just died. And over the years there have been some theories, and the leading three theories was one that he died from war wounds too, that he died in a chariot accident that seems possible, or because of a chariot accident, and the third was murder, that he was clubbed in the back of the head or poisoned. I didn't see the poison one. So the club one, uh, well, let let's get into this. Then there was a lot of political intrigue going on and there were people that may have wanted him dead. Well. Yeah, one of the high priests, Um inherited the throne after Tout's death, and they were all in a very close close position to have murdered him. And he owned the club yeah exact, used to carry they called him clubby clubby the High priest Um. So his body has been uh, we'll get to the beginning. But it was found at first in the twenties and just mangled. They mangled this dude, yeh. They think now. The hole in the head was when they were taking off his ceremonial mask that really punctured a hole in his head. That's where the hole came from. Well, he was, he was. They used a lot of like resins and things back then to help mumify the body, and because of that, he was stuck to the coffin. And uh, Howard Carter, he was the lead chief archaeologist on this dig Um, had his guy heat up a knife and was just like cutting through his body. And in the end they you know, they were like dozens of fractures and they couldn't tell, you know, are these fractures here because his team mismanaged it or were they real fractures. So the mystery like builds up over the years. Yeah, he had a broken leg too, and that could have been from the chariot accident, could have him from that, dude, well not even they proved that it was pre mortem and it started to heal, well, it started to react. It wasn't healing yet. But all this came about because unnamed TV network funded a like a million dollar dig to make the show The Secrets of tut in Common or something like that, and they got a ct A cat scan on site, a portable one and for the first time, we're able to run his body or what was left of it through a cat scan, which pretty cool, and they found out a few things. He had a severely impacted wisdom tooth. Then you should have seen it was like literally growing sideways in his mouth. I know. They said it most definitely hurt. But through the ct scan they were able to find there was no sign of infection, so that didn't kill him. He had the weird shaped skull, but they were shown that that wasn't because of wrapping. They do a lot of like head wrapping when they were babies, but they said that that's just the way their family skull was shaped, maybe because in breeding. Uh. They found he had no stern um or rib cage what and uh. But through the CT they found that the ribs were shown to be cut away and not fractured. Remember we I don't remember talking about removing the ribs, but remember we talked about them getting the internal organs out and then re stuffing it in the qualificat four inch fracture in the back of the skull not related to the little coin size hole and uh. Later on they found out that that wasn't actually a fracture. It was just where the skull wasn't fully fused because he was still a kid. Wow, so it's just a line. So they learned all this stuff. They end up finding that the fracture was shown to be pre mortem because they found embalming resin inside the fracture and if it would have happened afterwards, it wouldn't have like gone in the route that it went in. UH. Showed that it was beginning to react, which means it was healing. And they eventually found out that they think he died between one and five days after this leg fracture, which could have been a compound fracture which they think might have been infected. So that's the leading theory. I didn't see anything on this bone disease and the special though, did you find out about that? No, but I know I've seen that before. That has to do with him breeding as well a vascular bone necrosis, which is a degenerative bone disease. So and there's also malaria. People say malaria. Yeah, I didn't see that in the special either. The broken bone thing though, was like, uh, I mean that makes sense. Of course, he could die from an effective bone back then, Yeah, and his kneecap was gone on that leg. It was just man, that must have been a bad accident. Yeah, So they think it could have been a chariot or they think he could have been hurt and battle, which is why the chest was all messed up to like after he was down on the ground, they were just like pummeling them or it was clubby, which is not true. So, Um, just King Tut's death alone is uh. It's considered a world mystery as far as I understand, I'd certainly consider it that less of a mystery now though. Um. One of the reasons why it was he's such a celebrated king is because of his tomb. His tomb was the first and only UM royal tomb found that contained like just vast riches like everything that that Egyptologists which were basically like um antiquities, crazed Westerners who were running all over Egypt and um bribing officials to get stuff out of the country. And it was a strange time. But also you could call it the birth of archaeology. Um. The the Egyptologists had always hoped for a find like this. Yeah, it was only one that had been rated like outright. Supposedly. There's a lot of speculation around that too, which we'll get too. Oh yeah, yeah, um there there there was supposedly um it had been looted at least twice, and Howard Carter, the guy who led the dig that found Um King Tut's tomb uh suggested that it was in ancient times. The value of the kings, we should say, is this um area in Luxe or that qualifies as a necropolis, which is a city of the dead. And it was a functioning city of the dead. There are a bunch of different tombs, There were local officials and administrators and a local police force, and it was a very sacred place that was off site. Howard Carter alleged that at least once or at least twice, possibly more times. Thieves had um breached King Tut's tomb in ancient times and it eluded it, but to an extent, they didn't make it all the way in. So I saw that they weren't looted, but they were they broke in but didn't have a chance to loot it. Oh, he said they looted all sorts of stuff. He was basically saying, like, they looted this, and then he was very specific. Yeah. Um, but the the when when Carter found the King Tut's tomb, it's called k V sixty two, was the sixty sixty second tomb found in the Valley of the Kings. There's still a bunch of mountain there too. Well. Yeah, but the the most recent when they found was kV sixty three, and that was just in the last couple of decades, I believe. I think they said they found one every ten of twenty years at this point. Oh really, Yeah, So kV sixty two was found in the twenties and kV sixty three was found in the twenty one century. It's yeah, um, so it was a big deal when they found King Tut's tomb, which is one reason why I celebrated. The richest inside were another reason. But um, I think there's like four thousand objects that they found inside this um his his royal tomb. It was the big daddy. But one of the other things that has made King Tuts so famous is the supposed the curse that was upon his tomb that supposedly befell a large number of people who were either present when the tomb was breached or were connect it familiarly or um financially to the people who were there, including a dog, the Susie. I don't know the dog's name, Susie. Was it really okay? You think I just made that up? Yeah, that sounds like something I would say. I wouldn't name it Susie. You know, Susie had three legs. I would love three legged dogs. I want one. Well, you would love Susie. Well, yeah, until Susie died. So let's talk about this, Chuck, Let's talk about the kurs on King Tut's tomb. Yes, it all started with the financer financier excuse me, behind the whole operation or Carter's operation was a Lord Carnarvan and he was very rich guy. He was in very bad health. He had had a really bad car accident and apparently was just kind of a wreck of a human. Like during the dig, he would sit in a suspended cage lined with gauze. I'm serious. Yeah, he was in that bad of health until they actually opened it and then he was like I gotta get in there. Uh so he actually went in. Yeah he Um. He made it from uh England to Egypt in like record time. He took um a ship, a train, and a steamer down the Nile to get to Luxor. Once he found out that they were making headway. Yeah, and he got there in like two weeks, which was like, that's like really fast. Fact and especially if like you normally sit around in a suspended cage filled with gauze, lined with gauze. I kept trying to picture that. I wish I had a picture. I wish I couldn't picture it, Like I feel like I'm gonna vomit a little bit, especially like old timey wicker you know, like those old wheelchairs that are so disturbing. Yeah, from like the turn of the century, creepy. So what happened to him was he had a mosquito bite on his cheek he shaved one day with a straight razor and cut that mosquito bite open and uh died because of blood of blood disease from infection. Well, you're leaving a big point out. This was two months after he was there at the opening of King Tut's tomb. Yeah, this is breaking news. He had actually snuck in. This is when. Yeah, this is the un official unveiling. But uh, four months previous they poked their head in to take a look around. I think so. It was actually six months later I heard it was, And by Lord Carnavan's um own uh words, they did a lot more than poke their head in the party. Basically, they partied like they went supposedly. This is how Carter told it, and this is how he kept his job and his reputation still to this day. They opened the door just a little bit enough so we could peek in and so that there were so many riches, pulled the door shut and went and alerted the Egyptian antiquities authorities, right, which is exactly what supposed to do. Lord carbon On uh said no, actually we pushed the door. Carnavan Carvan, yeah, he said, Carnavon, Yeah. He said that they pushed the door open, went in, pushed another door open, went in, went as far as the shrine. UM pocketed a bunch of stuff. There's like stuff in Kansas City, there's stuff in Cleveland, there's things in at the met Um at the louver that. Yes, they are definitively linked to King tuts Toom that should not be there because UM, under the auspices of the agreement that ultimately fell between UM carbon On and UM Egypt, they were allowed to take nothing out, but they stole a lot of stuff. So yes, you're right. They entered in November and then Um he died in April. But in the meantime, though, and this definitely didn't help to spell any rumors of a curse, he kept losing his teeth, like one by one, his teeth were falling out before he died. I know the feeling. So imagine this Victorian era dude in a wicker cage with gauze, losing teeth. Yeah, that's that's what he looked like in the months leading up to his death. Yeah, he was in bad shape. Supposedly, at the moment of his death, the power the power grid of Egypt failed and then Susie and then Susie and then uh, well she died. Yeah. Back in England they said that she bade once and fell over death and he said she had let out a howel and died. And uh. Carter also had a pet canary that he got for good luck on the stig and it died on the day the tomb was officially opened. Some say it was killed by a cobra, which is a symbol of the pharaoh's so it must be a curse. Crazy. Uh. The rumors started spreading because this was a time when you couldn't readily get information, so they think that journalists got a little uh, took some liberties, started making up some more stories, spreading the word that it's actually a curse. Oh, they jumped all over it. The British press was crazy for this, but I think they actually made stuff up right, Um, they still do. Have you heard the news of the world? Um? And actually I read two sources for this idea of a mummy's curse, Chuck. One was um an American painter named Joseph Smith who told the tale about King Tutt's father in law, not King Tutt, but his father in law. Um canaton, I cannot one of the two his father in law slash cousin probably probably Um I cannot, who was known as the heretic King because he um he opped worshiping all the old gods, the pantheon of gods, and just um basically created in a monotheistic religion based on just raw. Yeah, I thought that was his dad. It was his father in law. Yeah, like you said. Um. The the Um priests clubby may have even been among them, because King cut came to the throne right after a knat and um he uh the priests cursed him to separate his body and his spirit forever. So that's the possible origin for the idea of a mummy's curse, because think about it, there's probably times when nobody thought of mummies and curses going hand in hand. Um. And then the other one comes from a short story called Lost in the Pyramid Colan The Mummy's Curse by none other than Louisa May Alcott, who wrote Little Women, So she may have started the idea of a mummy's curse too. Yeah you read Little Women. No, it's kind of a chick book, remember most his lack readit really Yeah, he was reading it to uh, an orphan. I think it's pretty funny. So, uh, this whole notion of a curse is that something was inscribed on the tomb. I've seen a couple of different versions. One is they who enter the sacred tomb shall swift to be visited by the wings of death. That's pretty cool. The other one was death will come on swift opinions to those who disturbed the rest of the pharaoh. Is it one or the other or was it even there? There's a third one. Yeah, no shirt, no shoes, no dice. Uh. So everyone in Europe and the United States at the time was really like they called it Egypt Domania, which kind of bothered me, but that's really what was going on. Like all things Egypt were really like enthralling at the time to the public because it was just like they seemed like a cult of death fetishists, right, And this is also the time when they're like we're mediums holding seances all over like America and England. So the Victorians are really into like death and like shrines to death. And this person was loved it, ate it up. And it wasn't just um Lord Carnarvan who was the one who died. It wasn't just him. UM. By ninety six, which was three years after UH, they opened the tomb, well a little over, UM, there were eleven people dead who were either at the um opening of the tomb or we're connected. And then by twenty one dead just Westerners. Yes, that's that's it. That's UM. Very good to bring up. There was. There have been two papers that have over the years that have debunked this. The first one came in nineteen thirty three UM a German Egyptologists named George Stendorf. He was German UM he U. He wrote a paper that basically said, look, man, there is no Mummy's curse. UM. These people who are dying, who are like struck by the curse, they're barely even connected to these people, UM. Some were more connected than others, like UM. Howard Carter's personal secretary died UM, and then his personal secretary's father killed himself. He left a note. His last words were, UM, it was the curse. I really cannot stand anymore horrors and hardly see what good I am doing here. So I am making my exit. And then he let out a window. He went out the window. It sounds to me like he had mental instability that's possible and was not cursed possibly um, but there and there there was some like Lady Elizabeth Carnavan who was actually there at the opening with her father, Um, who I guess changed his gauze. That was her role. Yeah, Um she died as well. So people connected, we're dying. But really for the most part, it was just wild rumor and speculation, according to Professor Steindorf. And then we come to the twenty one century and a guy named Mark R. Nelson of Monash University in Australia created a paper that ran in the British Medical Journal, which is pretty cool. Did you read it? Well, I didn't read the whole paper. Uh. He actually got a little more scientific with it and examined survival rates of uh forty four Westerners identified by Carter as being in Egypt during the examination. So and it just chose Westerners for good reason. That was uh if at the time, Egyptians lifespans would have been so radically different, average life expectancy would have been so different from Trusterners that it would have totally skewed the results, which makes sense. And he also only included people that were there at the time, because he worked on the assumption that it was the curse was a physical into d So only if you were there when the coffin was opened or present, then you would be afflicted by this curse. Right, And there were four opportunities to be afflicted by the curse by being present, right, four official ones. Yet and he actually his whole papers is bunk because he has the wrong dates. He completely leaves out the first entrance. Well that's what I'm saying, Yeah, the one yeah, right, But so he's got February seventy three, which is the opening of the the third door. This is supposedly the first time Carter and his expedition have gone into the shrine, into the tomb, but it's not. This is months after they've actually gone in and already started to looted. Yeah, and it was found by accident, which is one of the cool things. Oh no, no, I thought some kid happened upon the top step. Uh. Supposedly Carter's team came within a couple of centimeters of discovering it, and then Carter, they're working this one area for years and years and years, come within a couple of ser centimeters are discovering it, and then car it's like, let's stop working here, let's move over there. And then right when Carnavan says that's it, I'm not funding your expeditions anymore, Carter talks him into one more try, and then all of a sudden, there's the there's the tomb. So a kid found the step and told Carter. Right, one of Carter's workers came over and said, hey, I found it. But apparently Carter was like, oh, that's great, good thing. He knew he was. He was supposedly not quite the the gentleman adventure that he's made out to be like. He was definitely a thief who sold antiquities like on the black market for his own personal game. Well, it sounds like some Egyptian kid found the step and was like, hey, it's over here. Yeah. No, apparently he knew it was all along. Yes, Well, that kid begs to differ, I'm sure. Well, and the reason it's so hard to find was because during construction of other tombs, the I mean, I guess you could call it a construction crew, an ancient construction crew said their home base on top of what was uh touchstoom, And so the ruins they are kind of obscured things. And I think tout was either in the eighteenth or nineteenth dynasty, do you know so? And then the the home basis construction crew were alive during the twenty dynasty, so they came much later. All right, So sorry about that sidebar. Back to the dates. February three, uh, the opening of the sarcophagus, October tenth, ninety six, opening of the coffins, and then November eleventh, nineteen six, which was when they actually examined and mangled and broke apart the body because they had to get the gold off. They disattached the head from the body. I mean, they just mangled it all the bits um and what uh, what Mark Nelson found was that these exposures were absolutely no predictor of early death at all. And actually I was looking at a graphic compile wild Um, if you were exposed three or more times, your chances of dying early actually decreased. So that he really yeah, his data. His data showed that um, of the twenty five Westerners present during an opening or an examination or both, um, they lived in average of twenty eight years after exposure. The other Westerners that were in Egypt at the time that we're not exposed. During those four times lived twenty eight point nine years, like an eight year difference. Right. That was the curse I think was you shall die eight point one year sooner. Exactly. The mean age of death for people who were exposed to the curse seventy years, for those who were unexposed seventy five years. You shall not see seventy one, right exactly. Yeah, there's there's um. Yeah, especially back then, who musts to be seventy five not me? Um? So there you have it. There was no curse there, but it is possible that there is a scientific basis for people who were exposed to the tomb to have actually died younger than they would have otherwise had they not breached King Tut's tomb. That's right. And this special on this unnamed network also covered this. Uh So, what we're talking about, for the most part are bacteria, mold, fungus trapped in these tombs. Uh breathe and and and multiplies upon hitting oxygen. So when they open these things up, perhaps these people get sick, or people that were already sick get sicker and die. And Carter was actually he was aware that this is a possibility. He took air samples, he took sport samples. Um, or he tried to take sport samples. He said that there was like the place was sterile. Now he said there was mold and fungi. Okay, well, okay um. He said his air samples were sterile, which is just absolutely impossible. But he made a point that like if Lord Carnavan did die of a bacteria or an infection, he was far likelier to pick it up in Cairo at the time than he was in King Tut's tomb. That makes sense, it does, and that's been confirmed. Um. There are some other deadly things that you might encounter if you were to breach a tomb that hadn't been opened in several thousand years um from malde hyde, hydrogen, sulfide, ammonia. They all build up from decomposition um. One of the cool things that Carter noted um upon entering the shrine that the coffin shrine made of gold. This thing was a room within a room, and this room was made of gold. And there were coffins within coffins too. Yeah, I think five of them nesting coffin UM. But on top of the outer coffin. I guess which is the sarcophagus. There were still lotus flowers and berries that have been left. You know. However, how when did King tell live? I think that it was like three thousand years earlier, three thousand years before they left these lotus flowers on it, and it hadn't been touched since, which is pretty cool. And it's pretty cool. Um, these things also meet. You know, you gotta have your meat when you're traveling through the afterward life. Well, that's the idea, is that you want it. That's why you had six chariots, as you want to have everything you need for the next life. You want to have your favorite camera or five. Um. These things dee decompose themselves. They can attract mold like asper Gillis niger and Aspergillis flavis um. And there was a bacteriologist working in the late twentieth century who looked at medical records of workers um like modern Egyptian workers at the Valley of Kings, and found that a lot of them had been exposed to these things too. And apparently you can find those in tombs, so it's possible to be felled by that as well. Yeah, they they on this TV show, I saw they found another sealed tomb, which was the first one in like twenty years they did. Uh, I mean it wasn't a pharaoh. It was just like a priest or something. But they found a sealed tomb, and they thought, this is our opportunity to test a sealed tomb for pathogens. So they in the in the tomb itself, they found like vast quantities of mold, like tons and tons of mold, toxic mold. And then for the actual coffin, they used a vacuum sampler to suck out an air sample before they even opened it from this two thousand year old grave. And don't I saw the thing. It was something like that. And uh, what they found was exactly what he said for malde hyde, hydrogen, sulfide, ammony gas, all these toxic, uh, toxic fumes. But in the end they don't think that it could have been at a high enough level to actually like kill somebody. So while it was present, while all that mold was there, although you know, if he was already sick, it certainly might have contributed. He does it, he does thickly um. And then one last one, another bacteriologist from Germany at the University of Leipzig, UM conducted a study of forty mummies and found that every single one of them contained potentially dangerous mold. So of course it does. It's possible, but unlikely, and it's almost definitely was not a mummy's curse. I would say it very much definitely was not a curse of Louisa may Alcott. It was the curse of science and mold growing. So that you have it, man, that's your answer. Was there really a curse on King Tut's tomb? And oh uh, if you want to learn more about it, you can tell been King Tutt. That'll bring up a bunch of stuff on the site. Um, yeah, you just have to type it into a handy search bart how stuff works dot com And I said handy search bar, So let me use it's time for listener mail. Uh. You know they recreated his face too that I think that made a lot of press at the time. Yeah, I don't. He didn't seem to look abnormal though. Well if you look from the profile, he's got a money shaped head for sure. And it wasn't from rapping. They said it wasn't from rapping. Craig I say, that's just the family head. Have you ever heard of foot binding? Yeah? What is that? I don't know if it was in China or Japan or both, but um, like in the early twentieth century, late nineteenth century, probably further back, it was considered attractive for a woman to have a foot like a duck, like a triangle. So they would bind your feet to to this like bonzai into the shape for years, and then eventually you would have this deformed foot that was like the the point of the triangle was your heel, and then it went out into the other two points and there was your your foot, and it was considered very um and outlawed. It was definitely outlawed in China, and like you could get in big trouble if your you know, daughter was found to have bound for Wow, I've heard of that. I didn't know what it was. Odd mystery salt all right, Uh listener, Mayle, Hi, Chuck, Josh, and Jerry. By the way, Josh, I'm gonna call this, Uh that's why sk saving lives. Oh, this is a good one. Yeah, greetings from a long time listener in your new Atlanta neighbor. I don't think he literally lives next door to one of us. I think he just is a new in town. Got Jerry just laughed at that. I want to take a few moments to tell you how s Y s K contributed to saving my friend's life back in January of this year, a co worker and good friend of mine. I'm glad he said he was a good friend because when I read it initially, I didn't see that. It's like this guy came up a kidney for a co worker. Uh. A co worker was diagnosed with in stage kidney failure shortly after. He told me, you guys publish how organ donation works. After hearing about how long it might take on the waiting list and how many transplants were done each year, I decided that the least I could do was get tested. As it turns out, the other members of his family were disqualified due to a number of reasons, including age of medical history. But lo and behold, I was a match. And in parentheses, he says, that'll teach me the volunteer. What a good guy? No kidding, Mann ribs himself. Over the course of the summer, he and I were run through a battery of tests to match blood type and to prep the anti rejection drugs he would need after surgery, and then on October eighteenth, we did the transplant. I am thrilled to report now only a little over a month later, both of us are completely almost recovered and doing great. I would love it if you would encourage anyone on the fence about getting tested to go for it. The process is a little intimidating, but definitely worth it. Also, the unlimited and berry juice and chicken broth are great perks. And that is Dustin who gave up a kidney for a coworker. And you know what, it's one of our long standing s Y s K model mottos.

Um, I don't I don't even feel like a bad person or less of a person because it's so colossally out of something I would do for a co worker that like co workers that I love a kidney for. Jerry would say, I know you would, totally would. You wouldn't for me, though, would you. Well, you wouldn't for me either, but we both do it. For Jerry, it's a wash. Yeah, exactly. Um that.
