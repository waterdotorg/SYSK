Yeah, and this is super sad. So it's not like I love it and I think it's hysterical. I just I just like unsolved mystery. What's a what's an hysterical unsolved mystery? Um? Like, I got pants in the second grade and I don't know who did it. That's an hysterical unsolved mystery. I was just in line pants around the ankles turned around and like everyone's like did you just go with it and you're like, check it out, check me out of in second crate. Yep, God for that never happened. I made it up. Oh really yeah, it's called improv, buddy. It's a crowd. So end scene and scene and seen. Have we are established which one it is? Yeah? A few times and nope it is Chuck. We are talking about a family called the Solders. Um, not the Soldiers right, not the welding technique. No, the Solders. They are a family out of Fayetteville, West Virginia, UH of Italian extraction, as we'll see, Yes, and um very much so. Like you said, this is an unsolved mystery. They their family just going along totally normally has turned into one of the stranger unsolved mysteries in American history. Yeah, and certainly in West Virginia history. Definitely. And I should say I texted our friend Justin McElroy of the McElroy triplets. Well, they're not triplets, they're there. They're brothers of my brother, my brother and me podcast because they are from West Virginia. And as you'll see here there's a very famous billboard that we're going to talk about about this case and I was like, hey, dude, do you ever do you remember where you know seeing this thing? How far are you from Fayettville. He said, just a couple of hours, he said, but I've never heard of that. And I was like, really, this seems like the kind of cautionary tale that would be whispered about all over West Virginia. I can see that. But he said he never heard of it. And then he looked it up and said oh wow. And I said, I that your dad knows about it, and then he said he didn't. He didn't respond. You didn't text him back? Answer me, No, that's right. I am Facebook friends with his dad, though, should have says yeah, ask him, Yeah, go go to the source. That's right. So well, let's go back to the beginning. Chuck back to that's right. That's when Georgeiros who had become George sodder I was born in Sardinia and came to the US and nineteen o eight as a young lad of thirteen years old. Yeah, and he was a go getter, he really was. So his He had an older brother who traveled with him from Sardinia to New York. Um, I guess he was like, I don't want to do this, and right when they made it through Ellis Island, he turned right back around and went back to Italy. Yeah, he's I don't know, man, Go get a cup of coffee and think it over. What I say, if you made that ship's voyage, just mull it over for a day or two. Yeah, because what if, like you're half way back, you're like, actually I should have stayed. Yeah, you might meet a pretty lady from Brooklyn. You see that movie bok No great? Really? Yeah? Yeah, okay, it sound surprised. I was a little surprised. Yeah. It was nominated for many awards. That doesn't always mean it usually means it's pretty good. No, it's Pence Brooklyn, highly recommended about young Italian man who falls in love with an Irish immigrant. Oh well, this has nothing to do with this thing. No, not at all, because this man falls in love with an Italian immigrant. That's right, right? So, um, George, like you said, he was a bit of a go getter. He's thirteen, he's on his own, literally, without any any other family in America. It's kind of mind blowing. But then you think back to there there, they didn't really understand what childhood was at that point. So he's probably like of working age and have been for years. But it seems really weird to us now. He might have been retiring, right. He was smoking cigars already, so he, like I said, was a go getter. He started working at on the Pennsylvania Railroad and then moved to West Virginia to Smithers Smithers, West Virginia and worked as a truck driver and then said, you know what, this is America. Darn it. I didn't come here to drive a truck for someone. I'm gonna own my own trucking business. And the statue of Liberty went up, nice going king. So he started his own trucking business. Um, and he's in West Virginia. So in short order he starts hauling cole yeah, coal and dirt. And it wasn't like the hugest business. I think he did okay for himself. He did it okay for himself, like solidly middle class. Yeah, he didn't become like wealthy or anything. And as a matter of fact, later on um a local local government official would say that the Sauders were, um one of the best middle class families in Fayetteville, and they had a small Italian population in Fayetteville, which I think is why he ended up there in his community. Yeah, and he moved there with his wife Jenny, right, Yeah, Jenny Cipriani who he met UM. She came over from Italy when she was three. He met her historic called the music box and they got married. And like Italian families do, they had ten kids. Ten kids in twenty years. That's a lot of kids, pumping them out with great regularity. And like you said, when they moved to Fayettville, the reason they moved to Fatville had no idea that West Virginia even had Italian people in it, let alone strong Italian communities. But they moved to Fayettville and they were part of the Italian community, and George was well known. Again, they were a respected middle class family there. He did pretty good for himself. UM and he was also well known for his opinions and everything, including politics and UM. During the forties, the United States was at war with Italy and not all of the Italian Americans were UM feeling it. On the American side, there were a lot of disagreements over Mussolini and the government that he was creating. UM. Among Italian Americans, including in Fayetteville, West Virginia, and George in particular, hated Mussolini and very frequently spoke out about him and would get in arguments with some of the locals who who felt differently about Mussolini. And uh, I guess there were some hard feelings here there, but he doesn't seem to have taken them seriously very much. No, And we mentioned that, Um, if it sounds like we're setting something up for later, we indeed are, so just tuck that little fact away. Um, and then can we fast forward in time? Yeah? Too? Uh Christmas Eve? Christmas Eve? Right, so, um, here's what happens. It's Christmas Eve. Um. As his tradition, in some households, you can open up a few gifts on Christmas Eve. Yeah, so this is what happened. They opened up some presents comes time for Betty by and five of the children, Maurice fourteen, Martha twelve, Louis or Louie ten, Genie or Jenny as that was a little confusing because that's the mom's name. Eight years old. And Betty said, can we please stay up late and play with these new toys? Yeah, they're older, sister Marian had. She worked at a five and diameond Town two miles down the road, and she had surprised her younger brothers and sisters with some toys that they had not been expecting. That's right, and they were very happy. So they asked mom if they could stay up. Yeah, and the older, the elder, Jenny, said yeah, I guess you can stay up. Turn out the lights, locked the doors before you go to bed. I'm going to hit the rack with your dad. And are two year old daughter Sylvia, twenty three year old John and sixteen year old George Jr. Were I guess they were just ready for bed too. And then if you're thinking there's one missing child, he is away in the military, the eldest. Yeah, fighting either Mussolini or Hitler or to Joe, one of those guys. So he's away. Uh. And I could not, for the life of me find that guy's name. So, Um, the mom goes to bed, Jenny goes to bed, and Uh. The dad, George and his two next oldest sons who had been working with him that day, they'd all gone to bed about ten. Um, what time did the mom go to bed? At eleven? Something like that? Yeah, but she leaves those five youngest children, Um and Marian, they're older sister who I think was seventeen at the time, downstairs when she goes to bed Um. And then at about twelve thirty on Christmas Morne, because remember that was Christmas Eve, about twelve thirty at night, the phone rings, and um, this is not an era where and this kind of to me goes to show these people were doing all right. They had a phone in in West Virginia. They may have been the only people in West Virginia with the phone in nineteen I'm just saying, I don't think everybody had a phone in West Virginia, n so they certainly didn't have one at their bedside. So Jenny, the mom has to get up to answer the phone, and on the other line she hears a woman asking for somebody she didn't know or recognized, and in the background there's obviously a party going on. There's laughter, there's clinking of glasses, and uh, Jenny says, I don't know who you're talking about. You have the wrong number, and the woman laughs weirdly and hangs up. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and come out and say I think this means nothing, and it's total coincidence. So supposedly they tracked that woman down and she said it was just a wrong number. Potal coincidence, that's what I think. But think about that though, Like, had that not happened, a lot of other stuff would have gone unnoticed. Right, it's a big deal. So before she goes back to bed, she noticed the lights are on downstairs. She said, you know, turn the lights off, locked the door before you go to bed. So one of her kids is on the couch asleep. She's like, wait a minute, the doors unlocked, the lights are on. Um, they shouldn't have done that. So let me lock the doors and turn off the lights. And she leaves the one that's asleep on the couch asleep. It was the one that got her to sleepy time on the couch. That's fine. But those five younger ones who've been playing with their toys, they were not ordered to be found, so mom just assumed they went upstairs to bed. So she goes back to bed, and then like an hour later she's awoken by like a thump on the roof. Yeah, and she falls back asleep again. Well, it sounded like a heavy thump and a sliding down of the roof. This was just something heavy head landed on it and then slid off, and she just went back to sleep. Very important matter. She probably figured it was a reindeer or something like that at being Christmas, you never know. Uh. The next time she woke up, she woke up to panic and chaos because their house was on fire. And Chuck, we'll talk about the fire right after this. All right, dude, the house is on fire, that's right. So Sylvia a litt two year old Sylvia is in their room with her the parents, so they get her out obviously with them because she's in the crib. Uh. And then seventeen year old Marion and twenty year old John and sixth year old George Jr. Are all outside and safe right at this point. So everyone is out except for these five other kids, right. And they were the top floor of the house, I believe, in two different rooms, and the only way down is this one single staircase. And George tried to go back into the house. He broke through a window, cut his arm quite badly. Um getting into through in through the window or opening the door. Um, and runs inside and the entire downstairs floor is totally engulfed in flame and smoke. He can't see anything, but he can see that there's no way he can go up the staircase or anyone can make it down the staircase, So he runs back outside of the house to try to figure out another way to get up to those kids on the on the top floor. Yeah, and here's an interesting point, Um. One of the relatives of I think it was the guy who ended up marrying the youngest daughter later in life. UM Sylvia said they did a lot of research on this, and he said the original police report said that the very first statement said that the two sons, John and George, who got out, said they actually ran into the other kid's rooms and physically took them awake. And then later on in interviews they said no, they just called out to them, UM, and assume they heard. But it's still is a mystery as to whether or not that really happened. Police will say the first statement is usually the accurate one, UM, but that's just speculation. So from what I understand, the family rationalized that later on by saying that the two boys probably felt very guilty, and they said that they did what they wished. They had or felt that they should have done. That makes sense, and that their revisions later on were actually the factual ones that they tried to rouse their siblings by just shouting up the stairs. I can buy that. Um. So Papa tries to get in, cuts himself really bad. Then he says, wait a minute, I have this ladder that leans up against the house. Always always let me go grab that ladders not they're very weird. It is very weird. They would be found in a ditch like from the house later on, and later on witnesses supposedly saw dude stealing it, uh from the garage. But there's so many things that people say about this case that it's hard to know what's true and what was invented. That is true that they saw a guy a dude, well they report that they saw a guy. Well that guy the guy actually was found and was arrested and charged for stealing and never questioned about the actual fire. The guy that stole the ladder. Yeah, okay, so they he says. The dad says, let me get my trucks, my big uh coal Holland trucks and pull because those are tall. Let me pull that next to the house. Climb up on that. Uh, neither one of the trucks start, even though they've been using them to work earlier that day. Yeah. So the thinking by the cops and everyone else pretty much is in the panic he and his son flooded the engines trying to get him started, and that they wouldn't start. Yeah, but it became yet another like fishy detail that made this family suspect like something really weird happened here. Yeah, and then later there was a totally don't understand the whole engine removal theory. So it doesn't make any sense that guy who stole the ladder was caught stealing a block and tackle that you would use to remove engines. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. But it doesn't mean like he messed with their car or used that block and tackle to do anything to the engines. They probably just flooded him that one. I'm I'm in Green Mountain. So this this family they're watching helplessly as the house is going up in flames that was burned to the ground in about forty five minutes, ostensibly with the children trapped inside. Yeah, and if you think why didn't the fire the fire trucks come the Faettville Fire Department. Uh you know, it was was Fayetteville, West Virginia, Christmas. It was Christmas night or morning, I guess. At this point, um, uh you know, one of the daughters went to a neighbor's house called the fire department. No operators on duty even right, And another neighbor who saw this didn't have a phone at their house, so they went to the local tavern and they called the operator to report the fire too, and they couldn't get the operator either operator was probably at home sleeping for Christmas, that's right. So eventually someone drives and literally physically tracks down uh fire Chief F. J. Morris, who does not come out smelling well in this, Well he doesn't. He said, no, I can't drive the fire truck as the fire chief. And the way that they don't even have a siren. The way that they alerted the fire department was it's called a phone tree. They just start calling one another, then they called the next person, which made even the last sense because again the statters were the only people in West Virginia with a phone in their house. That's not true. Uh So eventually, seven hours later, at eight a m. The fire truck arrives to find a smoldering pile of ash, and a lot of people are like, well, clearly the fire department was paid off or told to halt. From what I gather, it was sheer ineptitude. And also the sense I think the fire marshal or fire chief defended himself later saying, yeah, he said I couldn't drive the fire truckside to wait for somebody who could. And also that house went up so fast there was no there wasn't any need for us to get there in any kind of hurry. Well, I mean that's probably true. He also said burned in like between thirty and forty five minutes. Yeah, if you're a fire chief, that's not what you want to say, you know, like who cares when we get there? Also, one of the firemen who showed up was Jenny Satter's brother, So it's not like there was this conspiracy to among the fire department necessarily, although that is a common belief in people who pay attention to this case. Is so, what they find eight am as a house burn't to the ground, what they don't find are any remnants of those five children. Yeah, and here in is where the mystery really kicks in the family starts like paying attention to little weird details. At first, they just assumed that the kids have they're they're just totally gone. They were totally burned up. Well that's what the fire chief said. He was like, there's no remains whatsoever because it burned them to nothing. They did like a cursory examination of the rubble. They did find some other stuff, like they found appliances that were recognizable. They found a couple other things, but they never found any of the kids. Um. And they took the fire chief's word at face value and said, Okay, well our kids are in there. We can't bear to the side of this any longer. So George went and got a bunch of dirt and buried this site in about five ft of fill dirt and decided to plant a memorial garden there on the side of the house. Fire. Yeah, this is on January two, so that he wasn't supposed to do this. They're supposed to leave it open to continue to investigate. Um. The state police inspector said it was faulty wiring. It's now covered in dirt. Um And so now the family has just left alone saying what happened to our children? Are they were they in there? Right? So that that when they buried the place and dirt, they assumed that the children were still in there and this was there. They're grave now, they were never going to be found. Um. But then, like you said, they started thinking about weird details that emerged. Right. One of the first ones was the idea that it was faulty wiring. George basically knew for a fact that it wasn't faulty wiring. He'd recently had um an electric stove installed and just to make sure again there he was doing pretty well, just to make sure that the house didn't burn down with this new fangled electric stove, he had the wiring in the house redone and then he had it inspected by the power company who sent out an inspector and said they did a good job. The wiring is fine. So he basically knew almost for a fact that it wasn't faulty wiring in the house. Yeah. Not only that after the fire started, when they were outside, there were still lights on in the house, right, So remember Jenny came down and turned out the lights. She left the Christmas tree lights on, and while the house was burning. The Christmas tree was still the Christmas tree lights are on, which must have been like a really ghastly thing to see, you know. Uh. Speaking of the wiring, there was a point a few months earlier, and this is definitely a strange thing, when this guy showed up. He was a stranger, no one knew him, and he asked about, you know, working as a driver, and he didn't have any work for him, but he was sort of just I guess. They had the conversation outdoors, wandered around at the back of his house and said, you know what you're wiring here at your fuse box is going to cause a fire someday. And George thought, well, that's a really weird thing to say, because not only did I have it just inspected and it's fine, it's just a strange thing for you to say, Mr stranger, get off my property pretty much, but take the CONNOTI very nice, but weird and disconcerting after the fact. Obviously, sure he didn't think anything of at the time other than that's a weird thing to say. Yeah. Um. Another fishy thing that happened that really kind of stuck out in retrospect was the life insurance salesman. Right, a life insurance salesman came through and um tried to sell George some life insurance policies for his children, and George didn't bite, and the guy got I rate and his quote was kind of weird. Actually, Yeah, he said, your house is going to go up and smoke your g D house. Yeah, your children are going to be destroyed. And then here's here's where it really gets weird. He says, you will be repaid for the dirty things you've been saying about Mussolini. And George just went like, get off my property. Yeah, just the usual. Yea. So remember we said that he was outspoken about Mussolina and his politics. Um, clearly this got around to this dude, and uh, it's just a weird dis consort any thing to say, especially after these kids look like they may have perished in this fire. Yeah, especially if he didn't like make a big deal out of it at the time. Was this like a normal business attempt in West Virginia among the Italian community, Like your kids are gonna die, You'll be repaid for what you've been saying about Mussolini. Good day to you. I don't know, I'm sure that's not in the handbook. What's even fishier, though, Chuck, is that same guy served on the coroner's inquest jury that ruled that the fire was the result of faulty wiring. It all gets a little weird, uh, And then one other, well, not one other, quite a few other weird things. Um. One of the older sons said that, you know what, right before Christmas, there was a dude parked right across from our house, watching the school bus and watching the younger kids get off the school bus and come to the house. And it was clear that he was sitting there watching us, and it was strange. Yeah, he was in a van. Bet he was. He would have been if it were like the seventies, all that sickos and seventies. So, Chuck, let's take another break, because the mystery is about to deepen even more. The plot thickens, et cetera. All right, so thanks for getting a little weird. And all of a sudden, now Jenny and George the solder Um parents start thinking like, wait a minute, are our kids actually dead? Who was the last person to see them alive? That if if John and George Jr. To be believed they were the lasked ones to see him alive because they went and shook them awake, But they may not have actually done that well, and they changed her story to say that they didn't. So then technically Mary in, the seventeen year old older sister who brought the toys and was downstairs with the kids while they were playing with them, would have been the last to see them alive. But I could never find anybody pressing her for what her story was. So the assumption that I'm going on is that she just fell asleep on the couch, and when she fell asleep, the kids were still downstairs. But the solders are starting to wonder, like, wait a minute, where those kids even in the house when the house went down, And they they're backed up by the idea that no remains were found. Yeah, that's the one that really is bothering them. They're like, something should have been found. Yeah, and um, all of a sudden, this this story is starting to get national attention in the press, and the Sawders later on would say, George would say, if they were burned in the house, if they died in that house fire, I want to be convinced. And if they weren't, I want to know what happened to them. Um, and this kind of kicked off like a lifelong quest for for George and Jenny UM. And in nine to try to literally get to the bottom of it, they hired a guy to come in and investigate, to basically excavate the memorial site and look for the remains of the children, and he didn't find it. Well. Yeah, and previous to that, they did their own experiments with burning things, animal bones and uh, this sort of self experimentation to see what would remained. And there was always bones of course. Yeah, they could never get them to just to to turn into ash. Uh. They went to a crematorium even and said, you know, we're probably just not even getting missing hot enough and they said, well, actually, at two thousand degrees it would take two hours to completely burn a body up. Your house didn't get nearly that hot and it only burned for thirty to forty five minutes, so there should definitely be human remains like all over the place. Jenny kind of really turned into like this citizen scientist. Actually, she taught herself forensics as far as burning of remains goes. She um looked into other fires. There was another fire that happened around the same time that killed seven people. Uh, and the remains of all seven people were found in the in the burned out house as well. So She's like getting more and more convinced, and so is George that their kids are still alive. So in ninety nine they had a a forensic investigator of some sort come and do an investigation and an excavation of the site. And he turned up some stuff. He found some coins, found a dictionary that had belonged to the kids, and he did actually find some vertebrae, and he had the vertebrates sent off to the Smithsonian Institution actually, and they investigated this and issued a report about the bones. Yes they did. They said the human bones consist of four lumbar vertebrae belonging to one individual. The transfers recess of fused, so the age of this individual death should have been sixteen or seventeen top limit twenty two UM. And on this basis, the bones show greater skelepter maturation than what I would expect from a fourteen year old who was the oldest missing child. So basically it was either placed there by someone, it was not charred. It was not a part of the fire. It wasn't one of the kids, and it was either place there by someone or brought it happened to be in that dirt. Can you imagine that? Like, think about that. George went and got a bunch of filled dirt to come and fill in this memorial site and ended up disturbing a grave, like maybe an unmarked grave somewhere that didn't find. I didn't think that was remarkable. That's crazy. If you went and got filled dirt and you found bones, human bones, Yeah, I wouldn't. Can you tell by the pitch of my voice that that is crazy? I can uh. The The weird thing that they found was a uh this green rubber casing that later they found out it was a part of some kind of bomb um an incendiary device. And some people think that that's a weird thing to have on your property house that just burned. And they think this could have been the sound that Jeanie heard in the middle of the night when something hit the roof and roll off. Who knows, but she didn't hear a big boom. It seemed like if it was a bomb, that would have been pretty obvious. Yeah, But I mean if it was like a napalm bomment doesn't necessarily explode it just like nites threads. Yeah, so they don't make noise. I don't know. We'll go experiment with one. UM. So that that objection speculation, right. That Smithsonian report actually said it's really curious that that the bodies weren't recovered or found in this pretty good excavation that you guys hired this dude to do UM and it actually set off a larger investigation in West Virginia. The governor and the UM I think the state police superintendent both said, what you guys are doing is hopeless. The cases closed. Your kids died in that fire. The case closed, and the solders were like, no, we're gonna go hire a private detective. And they did hire a private detective. And he started sniffing around town and UM heard a weird rumor that the police that the fire chief had said that he actually found a heart and had put it in a box and buried it at the site, which is a weird thing to do, it is, and he went to the guy and was like, you gotta show me where this thing is buried. Uh, he does he actually dig it up and they find a sort of I wouldn't say fresh beef liver, fresh ish but not burned. And then he admits, you know what, I put this there hoping that someone would find this and just think it was a body part of one of their kids. We can close the case, very ham fisted way of closing a case. Jerk. Yeah, And it's just I don't know why he thought that would work. I don't want to say he's dumb, but it was a pretty dumb thing to do. Uh. So previous to this, all sorts of weird claims had started to fly in reportings of sightings all over the country. One woman was operating a tour stop about fifty miles west and she said, no, I saw them the morning after the fire, served in breakfast. Uh they got into a car with Florida license plates. Um and and trust me it was your kids. So that freaks him out of course. Uh. Then there was a hotel not too far in Charleston, and apparently late at night, the I think four kids had checked in accompanied by some adults, two women and two men, all Italian. And she said I tried to talk to the kids and tried to be nice, and the dudes freaked out and started talking Italian and like shuffled the kids out of there real quick. Yeah, and they left early the next morning, super super sketchy. Some ladies said that she saw the kids looking out of a car that was driving by as the house was on fire. Um. And then there were even more tips that kind of poured in over the years, um, including one uh that said that they were actually being held by a distant relative of Jenny's. Um. Someone said that Martha was in a convent out west I believe yep. In nineteen sixty seven, they got a letter from a lady in Houston said that, uh, the oldest boy or one of the boys Lewis had lived in that town, got drunk one night and basically told everyone who he was. Um. They actually went and in fact, George Solder and sometimes Jenny, he would go all over the country tracking down these leads and always sadly comes back empty handed. When he went to Texas, he got down there, met with the guy and it wasn't his son, obviously, but um, you know I had to go back and tell his wife, like another another zero in this one. Yeah, and like it's really sad when you step back and look at it from the perspective of the parents, like, they were not convinced that their kids died in this fire. They were open to the possibility, but they weren't convinced, and they wanted to know for the rest of their lives. So, Yeah, he would go all over the country chasing down leads. And the reason he would do this, Chuck, is because he got no help whatsoever from the local authorities. They The Sawders actually wrote to the FBI and got a reply from j Edgar Hoover himself that said, I'd love to help, but this is out of our jurisdiction. If your local cops will invite us to help, we'd be happy to help investigate. And the local cops said, thanks anyway, and turn the FBI down. I'm I can't imagine how frustrating that must have been for the Sawders to see that, to see Jagger Hoover say we'll help out, but these guys have to invite us and get turned down for that, you know. Yeah, so that, I mean it was the kind of their life obsession, and obsession is a really good good way to put it. There's a story of George seeing a picture in a paper of a ballet class in Manhattan, and he became convinced that one of the girls in the picture was his daughter, Betty, and he drove to Manhattan and demanded to see his daughter, and the parents are the school was like, you need to get out of here, dude, you've lost your mind. This is our kid. No, you can't see our kid. So he had to go back home after that. So it gets super weird. Jenny comes home, gets a male and sees a letter addressed to her, not to the family or to her and her husband. To Jenny Sawder opens it up post markedin Kentucky, no return address, and there was a photo of an Italian man. Well looked at the Italian in his mid twenties, so the age pits, and on the back of it said, in handwriting, Louis Solder, I love brother Frankie. I l I l boys A little boys A nine zero, one, three two or three five, no idea, the most weird, mysterious thing you could imagine. And I looked at a picture. They were like, this very well could be our son. It looks a lot like him. It looks more like him than I do. I didn't think it was him. I was like, the eyebrows didn't match to me, the nose didn't match. But you can never tell a kid from nine to twenty five, you know, because this is like almost twenty he might have looked like you know, it could be true, he might have looked different enough. Um. But yeah, that mystery just was never ever solved. And so back in the fifties, like after they started getting shut down by the local cops and then the state cops and everybody, they you know, they started to take matters in their own hands. And one of the things they did was erect that billboard that you asked Justin McElroy about. It became kind of famous. Aside from the mcilroys, everybody in West Virginia knew about it, um. And it was a billboard on the Solder's property with pictures, big pictures of the five children, um, with their name and age and then basically uh rundown of what the family thought may have happened to them. And it was at first they offered a five thousand dollar reward and then up to the ten thousand dollars. Yeah, and they owned it. So it was there for I mean until the eighties until um, so George died in and then Jenny died in nine and after Jenny died, they took the billboard down. That's right. What other reports came in. One bus driver said he claimed he saw someone throwing quote fireballs onto the house. Some of the stuff reeks that. I was pretty wasted at the time. Some of the stuff reeks have like that after the fact, stuff that people kind of invent like wait a minute, saw I got throwing fireballs? But there was verified after the fact weirdness. Oh yeah, for sure. You know that keeps this this case alive. Like one thing we didn't mention their telephone line was cut. Yeah, and some people say it was a guy that stole the ladder, climbed up cut the phone lines so they couldn't reach anyone. Uh But I mean you said they found the guy. Did he did they ask him about that? From what I understand, they didn't ask him anything. They just find him for for theft, ladder theft and block and tackle theft. Oh. The other weird thing is um they hired another private investigator at one point to track down where that letter came from. The picture of Lewis and this guy just disappears. Yeah, he may have just been like a CD gum too, you know, maybe and just took their money. Quite possibly, or maybe he was murdered because he found out the truth. I don't know, but they said that he literally vanished like they couldn't ever reach him again. I think it's likely he's a CD gum. She we just took some desperate famili's money and hopefully he's burning in hell. Did the mafia rub him out? Because that became one of the leading theories that George was approached by the mafia, rebuffed their advances and um that was it. They they took the kids. Uh well yeah, And supposedly it's not just a total flight of fancy. Apparently the mafia was really big in the coal business and the trucking business in the area at that time, so it is entirely possible he was approached by the mafia. And he does sound like the kind of guy who tell him to like go stick it. Yeah, you know, he also may have made some enemies with the Mussolini cracks. What else was there? Well, one thing that that was lost to time was that vertebrae. Even though it's almost that it was not one of the kids. At least if they still had that, they could DNA test it now. Yeah, but of course they can't. Yeah. And so little little baby Sylvia who is two maybe three at the time, I think two is is what I've seen most um is the last surviving Solder child. And she said, like, these of her earliest memories are of that night of the fire and seeing her father like losing his mind, trying to get in his house and bleeding. Um. And she promised her parents that she would keep the story alive, so she she talks about it a lot um. She goes onto the online like online sleuth websites that talk about the case, and like kind of feeds information to people and tries to keep the story alive. It's just crazy, man, You go to bed, you wake up with a fire, and five of your five of your children are just vanished. And there's no way they burned up to nothing. That's just impossible. So I read this blog post. Like a MPR person named Stacy Horn did a piece on it, like years back, and she wrote this really long blog post about stuff that had been cut from the from the piece, and I got the imperson they were trying to play up the mystery, and she said that she personally came to believe that the children did die in the fire, and that there was plenty of evidence that supports that idea, but that the media tends to play up the other. But she also said that there's enough weird stuff surrounding it that if she learned that they were still alive, she wouldn't be shocked. Well, yeah, and the fact that they never got in touch, because you you know, it's not like these kids were strange from their parents or I mean, they were a tight knit family by all accounts, right, And the family rationalized that by saying that their family was in danger and they were trying to protect their parents by never getting into which would kind of align with the mafia theory. Yeah. Just terrible man, lose half your family without a trace. Yeah. Uh, if you want to know more about this, there's plenty of sites on the internet that have stuff. But we found this really great article that we bass on by Karen Abbott. It was called The Children Who Went Up and Smoke. Yeah, the NPR wents good and Stacy Hornson is pretty cool too. You know, it's weird. Does I have a good friend named Stacy Horne. It's not the same one. No, But when I clicked, I was like, oh interesting, and I clicked on her thing and it said stay seehorn like cat. She's a cat person. My friend Stacy is a noted cat person and it's not the same person, you know, And I was like, weird doppelganger? Yeah, no, no, maybe the name doppelganger. Yeah, I'd have to see her face. I think I said something, well, how about the search bar? And since that, since search far, it's time for listener mail, Chuck, handy dandy search bar. People said that they miss that. I used to say that the handy search bar. Yeah. I don't think I said handy dandy? Did I? Maybe Jerry said yes, that's back when she listened, so I would take that better word. Hey guys, huge fan of the show. Two exclamation points. Yeah, I've been listening to your show for about a year now, and I turned my wife and kids onto the program, and they're all hooked. We had a stuff you should Know marathon even in our car right back to Chicago from Athens, Georgia. We look forward to your new episodes and are burning through them quickly to pick up the pace. You guys made reference to lead paints being on roadside signs. That is highly unlikely, says Sean. Uh. Those signs are changed quite frequently in her base, predominantly Uh. And then he goes on to name like eight different types of pigment chemistries which I won't read out, and other mixtures of iron oxides. Uh. He said. Lead chromates can still be found, however, in road markings like yellow and white lines on the street. Any new road markings are now done with the chemistries I mentioned previously, but there are many states across the country that still haven't gotten around replacing removing the lead chromate based paints on the street. Not trying to nitpick. It's common misconception of people outside the color industry, and based on my nerd ing out with the chemistry name dropping, I bet you can't guess what industry I'm in. Here's a hint. I don't dance. He s needs a chemistry nerd. Was that do thing thing in street? Nerds don't dance? I think that that may be a reference. Is something we said that I'm not picking up on him. Maybe maybe Sean can clear it up. Yeah, we need to follow up listener mail. All right, that's from Sean Mula. Oh it was German. He didn't he dropped the m rail. Okay, so more he didn't want that association. Well, thanks Sean, we appreciate that. Uh, let us know about the dancing thing. I think we're not the only ones who're curious, right, Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. If you know what Shawn is talking about, you can tweet to us at s Y s K podcast.
