Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff You Should Know from house stock Works dot Com. Hey, welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and uh that makes the Stuff you Should Know the l A edition. Yeah, called me a Choco. Is that your name? Hell, Chaco, I don't know what does that mean? The chocolate? I don't know. It probably means something bad, Chaco. We might just look that up. It might mean nothing at all. I just said instead of Chucko, I said Chaco. I like, well, it's the kind of um like crunchy sandals. Chaco. There's a canyon all right, Yeah, you're you're the canyon. Yeah. From that the Anasaza used to inhabit. That's my luchador name, okay, and you pronounce it correctly. It's not Luke, It's luch Do people say Lukador? I did in my head until I looked up the lucha Lucha libreva boom. Yes, yeah, the sexiest of all wrestling matches. I just went over how to video. All right, what's your intro? Well, this is pretty much it this long, meandering, terrible thing. Ah. While we're talking about Chuck Mexican Wrestling also known as Lucha Libre, file this under fun. Yeah, this is pretty cool. Um, we're going to go ahead right now and promise a larger pro wrestling UM podcast. I think I think we should do it because there's a documentary out now, UM that I want to see called Memphis Heat, and it's about Memphis wrestling Jerry Lawler came from and Coffin was involved in, like like what basically gave birth to w WF what I consider the heyday. Sure, and Luca Libre is very reminiscent to me of the older days of American wrestling, which I'm not into anymore. It doesn't good kid, I was, Oh, yeah, man, he saw Jim tugging um Hulk Andre the Giant w W Y there's a cartoon run there. Didn't they have a cartoon? I'm pretty sure they did. If they haven't, then their way overdue. Yeah. Have you ever heard Jason Segels Andre the Giant? But it's amazing. He does something with his throat and it's uh. He did it in that one movie with Paul Rudd that was actually pretty good. And then he did it on Saturday Night Live recently in a skit called Andre the Giant orders ice cream and he goes into an ice cream shop. It just yeah, it's really I will definitely check it out. But we're talking about Mexican wrestling today. We're talking about Mexican wrestling, um. And to talk about Mexican wrestling, unfortunately, UM, you have to go back to the beginning of wrestling, which originated in America. Yeah, that's kind of wrestling. Sure, yeah, yeah, we're not talking like Greco Roman or anything like that. But professional wrestling started in the late nineteenth century in America. UM, and it had a little bit of a boom. It was very serious, it was very legitimate, and then people got bored with it. YEP. So in the nineteen twenties, these guys, these three professional wrestlers called the gold Dust Trio. Yeah, they because everything they touched her into gold. And they were like expert promoters. They were like, you know what, I think we should stop taking ourselves to seriously, let's just start making things up. And everybody said what and they're like yeah, yeah, we're like we do this in carnivals. Rights Entertainment and everybody said, well, yeah, this is a carnival act. They said, well, we know about KFABE and cafebe is basically like keeping up the suspension of disbelief. It's made up stuff carried out as if it were real. That's the whole premise behind professional wrestling, which I'm sorry to break in eleven year old heart. Right now, professional wrestling is fake. The athleticism isn't fake. But if somebody like is you know, really the the guy outside of the ring is not really sleeping with the other guy's wife and that's not why they're fighting, right then, right? Okay, so, um, the storylines are manufactured for entertainment purposes. But they're all amazing athletes and they all do really get hurt and inflict pain many times. Yeah, I mean it's real blood. Um. Okay, well in a lot of cases. In some cases. Uh so this isies when pro wrestling, as we understand it, with the Cafe Abe started, within ten years we had luch libre Mexican wrestling. Yeah, thanks to a guy named Don Salvador Lutos Gonzales. That's right, he is the father of the Lucha libre and he started the first Mexican Wrestling league called the Impresi, Makana, the Lucha Libre and thank you, and it originally came from Spain from what I understand too, and they called it catches, catch can and then just catch. But then during the Spanish Civil War, I think people, uh, the Spanish went back to Spain and it sort of just the wrestlers migrated over to Mexico. Is that it worked. Yes, the Spanish Civil War shut everything down. Let's shut the league's downy Um. What was that movie where that It was about the little boy and it's set during the Spanish Civil War in the orphanage. Uh that was what's his face? The Gilmo del Toro. What was the name of that movie. It was good, It was very creepy. So see that movie, look it up. So yeah, so um, Don Gonzalez said, okay, well, let's just take it back to Mexico. And that's where Mexican wrestling came from. That's why it's seated in Mexico. Um. The earliest Mexican wrestlers used to go back and forth between Mexico and Spain until the Spanish Civil War. And they said Spain is a little crazy, right, now we're going to stick to Mexico. And not only that, we've got a steady supply of professional wrestlers from America. They're gonna make up some of the earliest Lucca doors. Yeah. He was inspired by Texas wrestling, right, which that was pretty awesome in the nineteen thirties. Yes, well I think it was, if not based in Texas, there were carnivals that were being held that came through Texas to saw Um and so he gave birth to what was it called the Impressive Mexicana de Lucha Libre. Yeah, the E M L L which is now yes, and this is like the the w W E of Mexican wrestling. It's like the big one Concerjo de Luca Libre. Why do you crack up every day you do? It's so internest. Well I'll try to, you know, be authentica. UM so chuck wish. Since since you are so into the Spanish um pronunciation, can you translate lucha libre for the listeners? Yes, Uh, free fighting or free wrestling is what it's called, or translated as and M. One of the reasons why is because you know, sort of Lucy goosey. It wasn't like it's entertainment and not sport. So you want to talk about the entertainment, let's talk about lucha libre as a whole, like on a very broad scale. Okay, the luchador is the name of the wrestler. Lucha libre is the wrestling and they one one of the biggest things that distinguishes them from their American counter parts is the mask. The mask is huge, and while not all of them wear masks, most of them start out wearing masks. Very important to the culture. It is of their wrestling. Um. And it's a really really big deal to not wear the mask. Like, you can't just go up and unmasked a Mexican wrestler. No, no, no, they'll kill you on the spot. Um. This whole kind of persona of the luchador goes outside of the ring too, And so you may be in your local grocery store and if a luchador lives nearby, he will probably be grocery shopping wearing his mask. Yeah. They carry that identity. Uh A lot of times they will pass it down to their their sons and carry on the family tradition of of the luchador. Very important to the culture. It's not just some you know, redneck sport like it is here right now. Um, not true. I'm sorry. Did you like how quickly I agreed? We're gonna get in trouble for that one. We are. Um. So, Luchadors are technical traditionally divided along two lines, the good guys and the bad guys, or in American pro wrestling, the bad guys are called heels. Down there, they're called rudos, rude boys, or um just basically villains. And then the good guys, the heroes, are called technicos and um, yeah, you've got. The rudos are often um like that. I guess the spine of lucha libre is that it's very populist. So like a technico will be like based on a superhero, a saint, an Aztec warrior, somebody who is all about fighting for the common man. Yes, the farmers, the poor people. We are the ones who will stick up for you, right exactly. And then the rudos they're like they often have the character of corrupt cop or official, a drug dealer, a gangster. Yeah, which I imagine, like, especially these days, if you are a rudeo and you're like portraying a drug dealer, you're probably on thin ice and that might not be the best choice these days. Um. And so that's this battle between you know, the the little person and then the larger authority that's trying to oppress them, and then the little person of the person that is fights on behalf of the little person tends to win. That's right. Good good conquers evil exactly. Yea, unless you're a good villain, because that can be played up, you know, over the years as well. Sure, I think one of these guys that can't remember made his career as one of like the great villains, that was Guerrero, I think. Okay, I believe, yes, we mentioned the masks how important they are. The masters play such a huge part that they have certain matches called uh luca pistas matches with wagers. Did you see this? They are very special match matches where they will wager generally one of three things, either their mask, their hair, or their career, and it can be in any combination. It can be I bet my mask versus your hair, my hair versus your hair, my career versus your mask. I just I bet my hair. But this about it. And at the end of this match, obviously whoever loses either is unmasked, which means they're either done or they adopt a new persona and leave that behind. I have heard that that's not the case. I heard that if you lose your mask, you can't wrestle masked any longer. You can wrestle, but you wrestle shamefully, as Jonathan Strickling explained it to me, shamefully bare faced. Okay, well, I've seen you can adopt a new and so I bet you someone out there nose for sure. Yes, we'll find out, um. Or if you're probably nearing retirement, you would you would bet your career. I doubt if you would do that. It's like a twenty year old UM, because it would make much sense. And you will literally have to retire. At the end of the match. You will reveal your name, your hometown, and how long you've been wrestling traditionally after you've been unmasked or retired by defeat. And uh that is the Lucas day a quistas, and they don't do it very often. It's pretty heated match obviously. Yeah, I would imagine this. There's something at Steak. It's probably very um, very well watched too. It's also characterized more like the lighter wrestlers are more popular, whereas in the United States the more popular guy. I mean, they're all huge, huge, right rif um. But yeah, Luca Doors tend to be smaller and quicker and more agile than American wrestlers. There's a little more high flying acrobatics that's associated with lucha libre, and it's like very fast paced, like one move after the other. That's right. Um. And also we I wanted to mention rudous, like the characters are sometimes Americans and just to get the crowd rialed up, like the American Rudeau will, um, we'll be just as total racist and like classist, right and um. And apparently the crowd goes crazy for that. I'm sure against that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's funny. So you mentioned the main league now is the CMLL. There's also a rival league. And I don't keep up with American Pro wrestling anymore. They're they're still is it two leagues? I know there's like w We have a friend who moved to w W. Yeah, that's right. I don't know what the rival is anymore, though w W I think it is. I think it is I'm pretty sure. Well, they had their International Wrestling Revolution group and uh oh, I'm sorry. There that that that's that's the the smaller independent leagues that are also scattered about the country. But the main rival league is the Estencia a Sesoria the Administration or the A. So they have two big leagues and then some smaller independent like those are the cool ones. I saw some videos and it looks like the old school American Day's when they're in front of like four thousand people in a gym, like just flying around. They still do that in UM like in Memphis, but it's not like four thousand people, it's like forty yeah, at the Pyramid. And then Strickland also told me about um No like West Memphis, Arkansas, like in a like an basically covered alley. Gotcha, um there's a play. There's this group called Chikara out of Philadelphia and they've basically they do this absurdist Mexican wrestling. Strickland told me about this um where like there's this guy named ice Cream Jr. And his persona is like a clown with like a little clown hat sacking out the side of his head. His face is painted and his secret weapon is a bag of sock filled with ice cream sprinkles that like he'll throw it like his opponent and it just burns him like acid. He'll he'll, you know. There's this one great shot of it of him throwing it on his opponent, the guy just writhing in pain, and ice Cream Junior like put some more on the mat and he goes to like drop the guy on it, but the guy gets to drop on him and throws ice Cream Junior down. He starts writhing like how my back. It's really great. You have to see it. I'll send it right now. Okay, Yeah, I find that remarkable. Yeah, we should post that to our Facebook page, say we're gonna do that. But it's um. It's it's the same thing. It's just like in this fluorescent light gym with like fifty or a hundred people and it's called kara. Yeah, but that kind of combines Mexican wrestling with Japanese style Mexican wrestling. Yeah, it's a big over there, right. It is UM And there's been a couple of wrestlers that have kind of taken it to the next level, Ultimo Dragon and Tiger Mask. Tiger Mask. It's awesome. You know what I think I have. I mean it's a tiger mask, right yeah. Um, and these guys are like the I guess Japanese stars of Mexican wrestling in Japan, so I love it. You mentioned Lucha va Boom earlier. That is a variation of Lucha Libra that's pretty popular right now because it combines wrestling with burlesque, striped tease and stand up comedy and not just stand up comedy, like um, like girls spinning three hula hoops and one piece stuff and like, um yeah, uh, just anything you can think of. Um, that's just totally out there. And I think it's based in Los Angeles. They should do that in the middle of a roller derby ring. It's very I'm surprised that they haven't. And if they haven't, and they listen to podcast that they start doing and served tons of beer. They they suggest to best watch it that you drink tequila shots. Seriously. I was watching this how to watch um Lucha va Boom, and they were like, this is the rudos, this is what you do for him boo, and then this is the technic post and you cheer for him, and then you you want to drink tequila shots, but not so much that you throw up and get up on the stage because that'll ruin it. Um. It's pretty cool. But so Lucha va Boom is going to be in Calgary, Edmonton. There is the tie that binds this one with chem trails in case you ever come across the questions all related um on January seven eight at the Calgary High Performance Rodeo their headlining. If I live in Calgary, I would go to that they should bring this to Atlanta. Well, normally they have it in l A at the Mayan Theater. Yeah, and Atlanta has a you know, a large uh Latino population, so and dudes like us, Yeah, that mix well with that crowd. Yes, like like to do tequila shots, but not so much that we throw up because that ruins it. Um. Let's talk about the wrestling, the rastling itself. Okay, uh, they have many more weight classes than our American uh count their American counterparts because it was originally based on boxing classes, which is great because, like you said, the little light guys can fly around and jump and do these awesome aerial moves that you don't see as much anymore in the US. UM. And one of those weights. I was like, you know, I'm going to take this opportunity to look up what the heck welter weight means. So it looked up welter and welter itself means like wallo. It has nothing to do with anything else. But if you look up the entomology of welter weight, they think that it's based on uh, the English word welt, which means to beat severely. So I was like, okay, that's what welter weight. It's the weight class where the people beat severely one another. Yeah, pretty cool. Hundred seventy pounds by the way for the welter weight. Yeah, you would think the heavy weights would be welter weight then, yeah, because they inflicked more bruises. I guess not. I guess not so, um, Chuck. There's different kinds of matches you can have. You have like single matches, boring. Yeah, those are not the most popular ones. Um, but we need to go over the rules. They're there for a purpose, so we have to tell them. Um, there's four ways to win a single match. That's to pin for three seconds, knock somebody out of the ring for twenty seconds, to make your opponents submit, which you don't tap in Mexican wrestling, you waver you say refereo like I'm about to die here, I want to quit. Or you can be disqualified. The other person can be disqualified. Yeah, there's a few ways that can happen. If you take off someone's mask, that is a disqualification unless the storyline calls for it. Um. No weapons, so like you're not gonna see any chair hitting going on. Okay, that's definitely different. Uh No, groin shots. No. And you can't attack the ref free Yeah, why would which makes sense, although you know they do that some in American wrestling. Yeah, and there's that one classic clip that was at the beginning of Malcolm in the middle of that the referee getting in front of a punch during that boxing manage and just getting kote. Classic. Yeah. I'm also pile driver. You you can't pile drive somebody, But like you said, like unmasking, they'll sometimes do it anyway, even though you're gonna get disqualified. But they customarily the person who's pile drived. Pile driven um is carried out on the stretcher to just make sure all the kids know, like, don't do this at home. It's very bad, which is pretty awesome. Yeah. Uh, they do that in the States, like don't try this at home unless you're really tough, Like they inject steroids in the middle of the ring in the States. So the referee can also stop the the uh the brawl for excessio de rhodesas, which is excessive punishment or violence, which is funny because it's saying like if you, uh excessively beat your opponent, we're gonna go ahead and give you the match. Oh you win? Yeah, Oh that's awesome. I know it's like a well, it's like the referee stop in a boxing match, I guess, or like a baseball game. What does that rule? I don't know. There's some rule where it's like the team's beating the other team by like twelve points. Yeah, mercy rule. Yeah, if you're up by like eleven after a certain ending, they'll cough it. But it makes sense, I mean like humiliating that. It's not like you're going to give the win to the team that lost. Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's the same thing. Although these days you never know kids this country these days, Uh, like you said, the tag team matches are really where it's at in Mexican wrestling, uh, and the most popular of the tag team or the three on three the trios matches. Um. The goal there, if you're gonna win, is to either pin the captain or to pin both of the other two guys, right correct, Yeah, right though, and uh there's two referees usually in those. And there are also four and four five on five and you know it's it's a lot of action going on in the four on four those called the Atomic Coast matches, which is pretty cool. Yeah, like that, um, and then the five on five the whole like the only way to win is to pin the team captain apparently. Yeah. And another difference between that and American wrestling. When you have a tag team in American wrestling is you have to literally tag each other, whereas in Mexican wrestling and lutal libre, if you're out of the ring, which either thrown out or you can crawl out, then your other partner can get right on in there, which really speeds things along and keeps it exciting. Yeah, as they say. And if you want to know if you moves or if you'd like to hear the names and descriptions of a few moves. We get you covered there. Basically, if you understand what the plancha is, you understand Mexican wrestling. Okay, Basically, the plancha is where your opponent is flat on his back on the in the ring um and you're up on the ropes and you jump on him with your full body weight. Yeah. Then there's variations to the plantcha. There's the tornillo, which is a plancha in which the wrestler who's jumping off of the ropes twists in mid air for visual effect. Sure, there's the cent on, which is a planta in which the diving wrestler lands on his back on top of the other wrestler nice um. And then that's pretty much it. I mean there's a couple of others. You want to take this, Well, if you're gonna head butt someone, they're gonna call that a tope um. And these are just a few of the moves. I mean, there are tons and tons of moves, and they're done in various combinations according to your personal flare. And they're all plant a rooted, are they No? Not all of them. There's plenty of plant of rooted moves. That's awesome. Cool leg twist where the guy would be on his back and get a dude like in a scissor hold with his legs and then do like this little break dance spin move to flip the guy over. There's there's a lot like the hurrican rana. What's up? Well, the rna is the position where so the wrestler holds the opponent's shoulders down with his knees and then hooks his legs with his arms, right yeah, and if you start that out with um a flying head scissor, you're doing the hurricane rana awesome as as popularized by Hurricane ra Miras Oh that was his name. Makes sense? Yeah? Uh? Yet another difference in Luca libre in American pro wrestling is in American pro wrestling. Aside from like the rock in your occasional appearance by Hulk Coogan and Rocky Three, wrestlers are generally wrestlers, whereas in Mexico they are national icons and generally they're on TV, They're in movies and comic books. They're all over the place. And that's thanks largely to um El Santo the King. Yeah, Santo, um, that's not what it means. I'm just calling him no, he means his name means the Saints of the Silver Mask. Santo Ellen Mascarado del Plata. Yes, Saints of the Silver Mask. So Santo um was a technico and Um he started. He was one of the original uh luchadors. Yeah, I was born in nineteen seventeen, started wrestling in the thirties, um, and by the fifties he was popular enough that this guy named Jose Cruz came along in and said, I want to make a comic book of you, and Santo said, all right, whatever, that's cool, and he made what became this few medic style. Have you heard a few medic comic books. You've seen him before. They're really unsettling and weird. But it's um photographs collages, right, So they'll be like a group of gangsters following Santo, and you can see the edges of where the person cut them out and put him together, arranged them and then drew like speech bubbles or whatever, and so the perspective is off. The backgrounds will be drawn, but like the characters are photographs. If you METI, it's Italian. I saw that. I didn't know what it was that when I googled it earlier. Yeah, for this guy. That's what that. That's what that the the style of comic book that two had and it went for like thirty five years. His comic book, um, life time went thirty five years. And he was also in like fifty movies from I think the first one was called Evil Brain. That was his breakthrough. Was Santo Versus the Zombies of course. Um and uh, the last one was Fury of the Karate Experts from two. So he's in fifty two movies and two of them were cameos awesome, and he acted a lot of times alongside other pro wrestlers, always masked of course. In fact, he was never unmasked. I saw picture of him. It's kind of disappointing. So not not disappointing the way he looked, but ed grabbed. The grabster says that there there are no photographs or there was one and it was not publicly available. Not true. Yeah, welcome to the internet, grabst exactly. Um. No, he he was actually he unmasked himself. Yeah. Later in life, he went on a show um called counter Punta, which I think means counterpoint yeah. Um, and he unmasked himself on that show and then he died a week later. Really yeah, but he was buried in his mask, and so was one of his acting partners, who was himself in twenty movies, The Blue Demon. Um. So both of those guys were buried in their luchador masks. And seriously, aside from him unmasking himself a week before he died, that man spent his entire life pretty much in that mask. People didn't know what he looked like. He was a national hero, like, but consider that, like, he was a wrestler and his wrestling persona made it out and out of the ring in to real life, into the movies, into comic books, and like, this guy wore this mask. That's crazy. He's handsome. I saw the picture of him. I have not seen it. Just type it in you find it right now. I tried and I didn't see one. Yeah, let's there. Uh. Blue Demon, as you mentioned, Uh, started in a bunch of his own movies as well. There was mill mascotas and he was the first guy to do a lot of the the big aerial moves. That's what he was known for. And he he was in a couple of films I think with The Blue Demon and Santo and he tried. He was one of the ones that made his name in the United States as well. Yeah. I think he was the first crossover or the first successful crossover. Yeah. I don't think we mentioned the w w E. God, I hope I get that right. One of the if not, both have have you know, contracts with the Lucha Libre organizations because you know, it's big money in both countries, so they want to they wanna and you know, there's a lot of Latinos living in the United States obviously, so they want to draw in that crowd, and so they try to do a little cross promotion when they can. Good sense. Um. Probably the most successful crossover guy was is Ray Mysterio. That's a great name. UM. He basically brought the idea of um Luca Libre to professional wrestling in America, at least this generation that's watching now. UM. And I think he's still wrestling. I don't know, Maybe we'll find out Mystico is still wrestling. He just came over to the w w E in two thousand eleven. Um. He had to change his name though. Yeah. He started out in the CMLLL in two thousand and six. UM, and he when he came over to the w w E. Apparently, see m l L doesn't have the same kind of contract with the w w E that the other one does, because they said, no, we own Mystico and his mask, so you have to change your name and wear a new mask and be shamed forever probably, And so he said, you know what, that's fine, I'll be since sara, which translates to without a face. He's like, you're still writing the checks, right, you know? Yeah? Anyways, all right, yeah, I'll be whatever then. And then you also mentioned Eddie Guerrero and he um. He was very popular heel Rudols who made a crossover into the w w E. Oh yeah, yeah, I've seen pictures of that guy. But he died in two thousand and five, supposedly of um steroid use. It was exacerbated by steroid use. There are female uh pro wrestlers in Mexico and they are called Lucadores obviously, and they have their own cml L has their own women's division, and Triple A also recognizes a mixed tag team championship, which I imagine would be pretty cool men and women wrestling wrestling together. But that's fine, and they have the mini Estralla or the minis, which is not only for little people but just people under five ft tall originally, although there are some now they're like five four or five five. Well, do you want to talk with the mini there? Well, they're little people that wrestle. Well, there's there's commonly a mini version of another of a larger luchador. Okay, so they'll be like, um, just kind of a sometimes they'll wrestle together. Um, sometimes they're alter egos, but they'll be like like a mini version of of a luchador. Did you hear about arter Rito. He was one of the mini's and he had a he did an R two D two bit. His name is Archrita. Yeah, that's pretty cool. And then perhaps the biggest way that it differentiates from American wrestling is since the nineteen fifties they have openly supported gay wrestlers, very flamboyant, cross dressing gay wrestlers. Yeah, they're called the Exotic Coast. Yeah, how about that. There's one um that's really kind of larger and in charge right now, um named Uhdra and he is the Queen of the Ring. That's what he builds himself as he commonly wrestles in like a bathing suitor bikini and pantyhose um in drag. I watched the interview with him. He's extremely, extremely flamboyant and um. Apparently he started out wrestling with a mask. Uh and then said, you know, I realized I'm hiding behind this and I don't feel like I need to hide. So he's one of also not only the probably the most flamboyant of the exotic cos the most openly gay of them all. Um, he's also one of the rare um Mexican wrestlers that wrestles without a mask. Yeah. And he said that, you know, the fans get behind me. He said that, you know, at first I'll get some booze and some like some things being said to me, but it's been going on since the nineteen fifties Exotico uh pro wrestler, and apparently fans get behind it in a in a country and sport that's obviously very geared towards the macho. Uh. It's pretty cool to know that they'll they'll get behind these guys and root for him. Yeah. Cassandra is the star. Robert Lamb of Stuff to Blow your mind told me you know about Cassandro right, well he uh also Cassandro was was trained by Raymisterio Senior, so he is like a real legit awesome lineage there. Yeah, the Mysterios have like this whole family dynasty. Yeah, that's real big his so Raymisterio who we mentioned his uncle, Raymisterio Senior um was like one of the original luchadors. And then they also has like a brother and nephew a cousin that are all also very um they're like successful luchadors too. Pretty cool. So I'd love to go to I hope the Bavoom or something comes to Atlanta. Like, I'm not so much into the w w E, but this stuff reminds me of the awesome childhood wrestling that I so enjoyed. Yeah, plus masks. Yeah, and if it doesn't come chuck, you can watch it on the internet. And by the way, I wanted to correct himself, that was Eddie Guerrero who was part of a family dynasty. Okay, not Mysterio, but there is a Ray Mysterious Senior. I've got some of these, you know. Lamb has like five of these masks, and uh el Cheapo my band was gonna wear them for our Halloween party and playing them, and so he lent them to me and I thought it was awesome. But my drummer was like mask what? Yeah, he did want to wear a mask. I know you're drummer and he needs to wear a mask. Um, And I almost meant to bring one in and then kind of dip behind the curtain before we started, and then just like sit down in surprise at the point I left mine at home too. Do you have one? Yeah, Strickling gave me one. What is it with those two? I don't know. Did they get together and wrestle and masks? You should see them around candy sprinkles though they can't even be in the same room. I got to see the video, all right, Well, um, that's it for Mexican wrestling a k a. Lucha Libre. Indeed, oh, we should probably mention Nacho Libre. I thought it was a good movie, What about you? I liked it, man, I mean, I love Jack Black, but he's he's I don't think it was his best I like Jack Black the least that he was the least part of that movie that I liked. But with that movie, keeping with the tradition. He played a man fighting for the rights of these orphans, right, so it was very much true to the lad And I'm so glad you brought that up, because I really feel like we would have gotten a lot of listener mail and we would have been remiss. How have we not brought up Super Barrio, who is a Mexican wrestler that exists only outside the ring. There's a guy who in the eighties was showing up at um like evictions things like that, in protests like um cheap housing protests. Uh. As this Mexican wrestler name named super Barrio, even though he didn't wrestle, was a big fat guy um and he uh, he was a an avenger for the rights of tenants. And he said, like he was interviewed, he ran for president of Mexico in night and uh he was interviewed and said, like in after this devastating earthquake that left a lot of people homeless in Mexico. Um, he was in his apartment and he was bathed suddenly in a yellow and red light and when it just pated, he said, quote, I was dressed like this, and he's wearing like a red and yellow like outfit with like a cape and everything. And he said that a voice told him you are super barrio, defender of tenants and scourge of greedy landlords. So he spent at least a decade showing up at rallies and like, you know, really having a real genuine impact for the greater good. I think I'd be way more into American pro wrestling if they had like these causes that they were behind, like defending the poor and stuff like, instead of just you know, I'm I don't even know their names anymore. Rowdy Roddy Piper. No, he wasn't. They lived. Oh so he's he's got a pass for me forever. Okay, I don't care what he does. He he was in They Live, and that's cool. He's old school. Yeah, all right, Well that's it about Roddy Roddy Piper. That's right. Um. And like we said, we'll do a pro wrestling once someday, we'll we'll try to figure it out. Okay. I thought about a tandem, but no, I thought that's you're gonna lose some listeners if you do a Tuesday Thursday wrestling combo. Yeah. Yeah, um, if you want to know more about Mexican wrestling.
