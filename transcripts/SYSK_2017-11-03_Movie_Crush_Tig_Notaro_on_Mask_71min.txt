Josh: Hey, folks, and welcome to Movie Crush. It's Chuck Bryant here, and uh boy, I gotta tell you this week is a pretty special episode. Uh this one needs a little bit of set up, and I urge you to, uh to listen to this one because the background of Tig Nataro's interview and how this thing started was, uh, well, well here's here's what went down. So I had met Tig before at her comedy festival that she curates every year, Benson Ball in Washington, d C. And Josh and I do our stuff you should know, live there usually every year, and was lucky enough to meet her last year and she's just really sweet and a very nice person. And so I hit her up to be on this show because she was coming through town to perform, and she said yes. It was very sweet of her to do so. And so day of the show, waiting for her to get here, texting with her assistant who was traveling with her, and uh, they said, all right, she's here, meet us downstairs. Met her downstairs. I was really excited because I adore Tick Nataro in her comedy, as I'm sure everyone listening does. And I meet her downstairs in our building and she's, Um, she's just a little weirdly removed, I guess the best way to say it. She's a very warm, friendly person, So it was different than I was expecting to get. Uh. She wasn't being mean or anything. She wouldn't be in a jerk, but I could tell something was going on, and I was uh, kind of walked around the building a little bit and then got on the elevator, and the whole time she was just sort of nodding and being being nice enough, but something was off, and I could tell something was off. So we get up here in the studio and she needs a moment to uh, to go to the little podcaster's room. So I walk her over there to the bathroom and say, here you go, I'll be inside. It's fine. She takes a while. She gets on the phone outside and it's sort of having a it looks like a fairly intense conversation, and uh wraps that up, and then we get into the studio. We sit down and we we are just sort of small talking initially, and she starts to cry right there in front of my face, and I don't know what to do. Um, she's just sort of crying and saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and I go all right, listen, um, I'm gonna give you a minute. And her assistance actually in the studio with us so said, I'm gonna give you all a sec uh and step out, um and let you, you know, deal with whatever's going on here. So I go out and I start chatting with producer Noel and I'm like, ticks in there crying and he, you know, he saw what was going on through the through the window here, and nobody knows what to do. Jerry's kind of over there too, and we're all just sort of wondering what we should do. So I give it a little bit of time. Finally, her assistant comes out and says, hey, she's good. She wants to do this. So I was like, are you sure and he says yes, come back in the studio. I sit down and I said, listen to it. Said, we do not have to do this. I said, whatever you've got going on is more important than this silly little show. And I will not think any less of you. Uh. If you want to postpone or cancel or whatever, I said, you take care of yourself here. That's what's important. And she said, she said, no, no no, no, I'll be all right. I was like, all right, and uh, I was like, are you sure. She said yeah, and she looked at me, and she looked at her phone own and she was sort of still wiping tears from her eyes, and she said it looks like I'm gonna live. And I just stopped, and I start to get a little emotional, honestly because I'm a sensitive guy. And I was like, what do you mean? And she said that was my doctor and she said, I had my five year ah results from my cancer treatment come back. And it was basically a call I was have been waiting on for three days on whether or not the cancer was back, and if the cancer was back in the way that they thought it could be, it would be a death sentence for me. And I just got the call I'm gonna live. And I am like literally fighting back tears at this point. Uh. She's two ft from me, and it's a very intense situation and she's sort of crying laughing at this point. So it's a good call. That's the great news. Um. But she was just overcome, obviously, And so we kind of chat for a moment and about she she called her her wife, Stephanie and shared the good news with her and they were crying and it was just really a super super special moment. But even so, even though it was good news, I said, listen, seriously, I know it's great, but if you you still don't have to do this, like we're literally sitting here about to talk about the movie mask and I don't blame you if this is like not what you want to do right now. And she said no, and she said, you know what, she said, this is exactly what I want to do right now. So that's the setup for this episode. Uh, my second interview ever with someone um for the show, not like the most accomplished interviewer yet, so needless to say, I was sort of on ice skates at this point, um, but it made for a really good conversation and I just really hope you enjoy it. So here we go with Tick Nataro and mask Man. Well, and especially after everything well and I'm right at my five year um mark where I was supposed to be technically in remission and people have been congratulating me, and I've been like walking around with like, well or I might be terrible, you know, Um, so I've just been like, come on, let's just get this news and um uh. And a funny addition to this is that Thomas was just talking about how uncomfortably is with people crying. I've never cried. We've worked together now for a long time. I've never cried in front of him. And then I'm like, oh, well, like the day after, he was like, well, I'm a little awkward when people cry, Like, oh no, I have to release this. Um this sad but very excited, new excited energy. Yeah. He was specifically talking about ex girl friends. Okay on track good, I'm alive. Stephanie knows. I told him. I told him. I told her, and she was texting that she was crying, and I think that really triggered me. Yeah. Well, and you have kids now, it's like not that it's ever a light, but that I have a lot in my life. Yeah, I love that's awesome. So everything's going great with the kids, Yeah, everything's I mean, I really have a pretty splendid life. Yeah, so there'd be a lot to mourn. Yeah. So uh yeah, anyway, boy is going to go down and history me too, Me too, um my apologies. Oh no, they're everyone. I think you have this thing where everyone cares about you so much as fans because you've been so open about all your experiences the past few years. So I think everyone feels like like you get a collective hug from your fan base, which I don't know if you can feel that, I'm sure you can. I definitely can. So Thomas gets the residual stuff at the merge booth. Are you doing season two of What Mississippi's coming out September eight? I'm so glad. Yeah, it's so great. Um, I think it has one of those I think the quality that I find a lot of TV shows is attracted to me is heart and um like Master of None is another one, and I think both those shows just have so much heart. Uh. And that's something you can't manufacture, you know. So uh, it's it's great, you can manufacture, it's just do you want to watch it? Yeah? Well exactly, Paul start, I guess. But my family families from Mississippi, so it's sort of that's what he was. He was reading that to me in the car. Oh, how how did you know Wikipedia? Oh? Is that on there? My family in Mississippi. They started an email chain that I was on talking about how I have a Wikipedia page, and they were all like oh, chiming in, like wow, right, guys, I've actually done a lot of other things and you could probably have your own Wikipedia page to write I mean somehow someway. Um, but this is not my biggest, biggest accomplishment. I hope not. Well, I think for a long time and stuff, you should know how to page. But I was like, no, why don't I have a personal page? And then that happened. I was like, be careful what you wish for. But um, yeah, my family, my dad's uh ancestry is from like Tupelo and Jackson, and I don't know, that's your that's your family. You have to you know all the towns of Mississippi, right, So I went there as a kid growing up and stuff. So it's kind of cool to see, um, although you didn't grow up there, right. I was born in Jackson. Then we moved to Pastristam, Mississippi on the Gulf Coast, and then yeah, we moved outside of Houston to Spring, Texas, and then I used to spend our summers in New Orleans and Jackson and Hattsburg and pastors Stan Right. Yeah, so you're familiar with this weather, don't you out too much? Good? Were your early days in Houston? Like, were you a big movie goer? Was? How did did they factor in? Um? I went and saw Greece and Star Wars, which are kind of my two big movies. Uh, yeah, you know what, I remember going to see Eddie Murphy his concert films, and also you know all Molly Ringwald movies. Um, yeah, just all that kind of I guess rat pack type of stuff, Molly ringwalden I was. I think I've always been a little more of a music person, and I followed stand up a lot also until I got into it, comedy records and um, but yeah, I think consistently through life, I'm always more heavily in the music world. Thomas and I were driving to Georgia yesterday, and I mean just going through anywhere from the Indigo Girls to Frightened Rabbit to Ronnie James Dio. You know, yeah, I don't, I don't just somehere. But it was a fun. Uh, it was a fun little drive. So you drove on this uh, I think you said you were Mississippi and then Oxford, Yeah, Oxford, Birmingham, Atlanta. Yeah, yeah, Thomas and we're talking before how do we mention who Thomas is? Yeah, Thomas is your assistant. It was feet from us, giggling in the background, smiling so proud of me. Right, Um, yeah, we were talking about stuff you show did a Birmingham show, and just how sometimes when you go to places like Birmingham and Oxford, they're just so appreciative. It's just really lovely. Well, I was reading um about Birmingham and I guess it's the number one unless I have completely wrong information, but the number one most liberal city in the Southern States. Oh really Yeah, m hmmm, probably of a certain size. Maybe I can't imagine a more liberal than like Athens, Georgia. Um, I don't. I don't know. How do you measure how liberal are places too? I'm not sure, but I could believe that though Birmingham is pretty cool. I think it's a pretty cool rep Yeah, I was. I was stunned. And I think Atlanta was ranking fourth. Yeah, where the city of Atlanta is, Um, it's fairly liberal and like the in town neighborhoods are, well, I know it's fairly liberal in Atlanta. I guess my shock was I thought it would be closer to the top, right, Yeah, yeah, I did too. I wonder what number two and three were. I don't remember. Again, I could have gotten all the wrong information. I'm here to spread. That's not what it shows about it anyway. Um, so we can go ahead and get into Mask if you want. Um I did. I should let everyone know I've verified a little nervously right before that it was not the Mask, the Jim Carey movie, because I don't know what I would have said about that. Well, here is the thing. There was a part of me that wanted to reach out and clarify which one. But then I also thought, it'll be hilarious if you researched the wrong movie and I came in to do a more dramatic film, and yours is You've researched this over the top, ridiculous film. And so I was like, you know what, just leave it. I appreciate that. Let it do what it wants to. Yeah. I think I would be in a panic if I hadn't seen Mask, and that happened. But Mask, for me was it was a big HBO movie. For me. I was born in Oh, yeah, what's your birthday? What's your birthday? Mar shut up really alright? Yeah, well, all right in Mississippi ancestry. So when I was third, I guess we were four seen then when he's kind of fun to say when Mask came out and it was I don't know about you, but HBO when that um landed in my neighborhood, we were kind of one of the last neighborhoods to get it because I kind of lived out in the woods and on a dirt road until it was paved when I was like twelve, So it was a really really big deal. Right, So HBO came late, and uh, I would just watch some of these movies over and over again, and Mask was one of those. You know what my HBO movie was, What under the Rainbow? Oh yeah, Chevy Chase. Uh what was the premisi was a Wizard of Oz like remake. No, I actually don't even remember what the movie was about, but I remember there were just a lot of little people, and um, I watched it several times today anytime it was on HBO, I was like, well, I know what I'm doing with my time. Yeah, I don't remember the premise that there was definitely a Wizard of Oz angle. I don't know if they were trying to do a remake or a musical or something. I have no idea. I mean, nothing stuck except Chevy Chase and Little People and but really I think that's the movie I've seen most in my life is Under the Rainbow thanks to HBO. Have you ever heard of that? Well, yeah, watch it. It didn't. Um that's not one of the like, that's not one of those even here about anymore of course not. It didn't live on in like the popular culture. I think it was thriving at the time, but something like Mask like still you know, I think people still talk about that kind of movie. I bring up Mask a lot and it is often followed by the Mask. So yeah, um so I watched it today again, um, Mask is really hard to find, um Like, you can't even pay for it on YouTube and as a rental um Like. I had to watch it on it on YouTube. But it was a The screen was in the top little third of the corner and then all around it were like starbursts going off and it was in Yeah that's the original So that sounds about terrible quality. Was really weird, But I've seen it, like I said, because of HBO, saw I don't. I mean, I can't even hazard a guess, but at least like ten times probably. So It's a movie I was really familiar with, but I hadn't seen in many, many years, so it was it was fun to, you know, kind of go back and watch it. Now, this is an embarrassing moment where I admit I didn't go back and watch it. That's okay, okay, no, no, no, that wasn't like part of my There won't be a quiz, so you don't need to worry about it. You remember the gist of the movie, right, yes, do so? Eric Stoltz, Oh I remember? Yes? Okay, I thought I thought you were about to say I didn't know that who that was? No? No, sure did. Yeah. I read a funny thing today where apparently at the rat party, uh, there were crew members introducing themselves to him because they didn't see him out of his makeup, so they didn't even know Eric's like what Erik Saltz looked like. And I also read that share dated him after the movie, which really, yeah, kind of tarnished it a bit in my head, that is that's bizarre. Yeah, I thought it was a little bit weird. I was about to say, are they the same age? But guess that doesn't matter. Well, no, of course not. But my wife's fifteen years younger than me. I think that's about the age difference of sertol. Did I just ruin it for you about me and Stephanie? No, no, no, no, that doesn't tarnish because well you didn't play your mom in a movie, so no, I played her love interest in a movie. That's right. Uh, she's really good in One Mississippi too. It's like that's part of the heart of that show. I think. Is this like a little sweet budding relationship that you guys have. She's so good in season two, she's so good. Really, Oh my gosh, who is the guy that plays your dad? Or yeah? Um John Rothman, Well he's so good and I've seen him like over the years as a character actor, but uh, she's that role is just so like internal. But um he's doing a lot with it. Yeah. Yeah, it's really uh fun to watch. Yeah, I just can't wait for season two, very excited. Um, so you know probably that Springsteen was supposed to be the songs, right or do you know that? I know what? Don't Bob seeger Bob Seger was the sound the soundtrack. Yeah, so he he was the stand in. Um Peter Bogdanovich, Um, the director was insistent on Springsteen being the guy because in real life, the real Rocky Dennis was a Springsteen fanatic, and so UM very famously he Uh. They had a battle because I think the record label UM and the I can't remember it was Columbia or Universal who was who? I think Springsteen was on Columbia and Universal was the movie studio. But they someone didn't like each other and they wouldn't allow it, and um and Bogdanovitch later sued the studio because they made him use Bob Seeger, whom I don't even think he cared for. Really, I feel like makes that movie. Oh my gosh, the end credits. I remember, Um, what Bob Seger song is that? Um, well, I can't tell you because I watched the director's cut today which has Springsteen. Really yeah, how was that? It was a little like Bizarro mask because you're right, like it's such a through line the Bob Seeger stuff, And then having seen the Seeger version fifteen times, A knew that the Springsteen version was out there, so it was a little strange hearing like thunder Road and Born to Run, And I'd feel so curious to see that version because I feel like Bob Seeger represents way more of that world, like biker Yeah, that biker world than Bruce Springstein. Does you know Bob Segers is on the nose? Yeah? Yeah, and the Catman do song, especially because you know, one of the big subplots of the movie was his europe trip that he was going to take with his friend. Yeah, I mean so so great. Yeah, alright, so Seeger, you're in the Seeger camp. I love Bob Seger. You're a fan. Uh well, we actually had a thing on stuff. You should know where I complained about Bob Seeger. Um. I think I was complaining about a specific song, Turn the Page, you know the song. Of course. I'm a Seeger fan anytime, so I can to tell you. And I think I made it. I think it may have just been so I can make the joke that should have been called turned the Station, um, because I always thought that was kind of a funny joke. And then, um, we heard a lot from a lot of people to your loyalists. That kind of gave me ship for that. And then Metallica. Do you hear their remake of Turned the Page? Oh? No, I don't think so. It's great. It's just a heavy, slow version. Yeah, it's good. It's I'm not typically a fan of remakes of anything. I'm always like, I think they had it handled, guys, relax, But I feel like Metallica did a really great Metallica version of Turn the Page. Wow, I'm gonna have to hear that. Yeah. Well it's sort of the ultimate Grizzly road song, you know, as a touring artist, and I do feel like when I hear that song, I'm just like, that's me turning the page. Well, well, you're definitely gonna have to check out the Springsteen version. I think you can get it on DVD unless you want to watch the weird um third screen YouTube starburst version. Um no, thank you. Um. But as far as the bikers go, UM, I don't know like what kind of growing up uh you did in Houston, But I was a very um, sort of sheltered Southern Baptist boy before I came to my senses later on in life, and um, the notion of like a biker gang was very exotic and scary to me. Um. So to see this movie where they like, you know, love puppies and did like blood drives. I don't know if you remember that scene where they were like had a blood drive at one of their bike rallies. I don't remember. It's kind of early on and that's where they had the puppies and they all you know, cared for Rocky and love one another, and it was just very kind of mind blowing for me to see, uh, this other world of like the bikers that I shouldn't fear them. Well, I think it's that typical situation, whether it's bikers or punk rockers or you know, just that whole like we take care of our own and then they you know, all the little spikes on the jackets, whether you're a biker a punk rocker, it's just the you know, stay away from me because if you get too close. I'm actually really soft and I love puppies and I love babies, and I'm it's like they don't trust how sensitive they actually are, so they have to put the spikes on their coat. Yeah that makes sense, and they're just like back off, I cry easily, but they can show that love to each other though. Yeah, I think when they're within their little community and there, um they have their little puppies and babies and well, it seemed unrealistic to me as a kid. But now that I'm older and I look at that, I think that's probably You're probably exactly right, yea, and Bogdanovitch probably nailed the biker scene like more than anyone else. Yeah, I whenever I see bikers, I'm I'm always just like I'm that's scary, right, I'm a biker. Yeah. I have two motorcycles, and uh well I started writing motorcycles. Well, I mean, how long do we have? I mean, the story triggers another. But I always wanted to ride motorcycles. And I had a friend growing up that invited me when I was in fourth grade to come over and ride motorcycles in her pasture. And I was and she said, do you know how to ride a motorcycle? And I was like yeah, because I'm like, uh yeah, I know. And so I went over to her house and we're going to ride motorcycles. And it was just a mini bike. You know what a mini bike is. It's just you don't have to like switch gears. It's just gas and break and motorcycles. Yeah, but they're just like little little things. And and so I got on her mini bike and I just I was like what And I mean no control of the bike. I just went shooting off through the pasture over like a bump and then they had like a hole in the and then I slammed into the fence and fell over and I had hurt my hand, and I just wanted my mommy, you know. And I had gone from just feeling soak, like yeah, I know how to ride a motorcycle because I truly just thought it was just doing from room in their hands. And you've probably ridden bicycles well, And I've been watching the Funds and I've been watching Evil Kinnevil, who I was obsessed with. And I had all those like wind up and my mother stopped buying them for us because the Evil Knevil doll ended up twice on our heaters that were on the floor and melted. Um. But anyway, when I was seventeen, I was going to play pool at this pool hall my friend, and there's this motorcycle shop next to the pool hall. And I had already dropped out of high school and had a job, and um, and I had saved all this money, and I was like, should I buy that motorcycle? And my friend I still didn't know how to ride one, and she was like, yeah, you have to. So we went back the next day and I bought the motorcycle. And when my friend and I went into the shop, this was our plan. We were pretending like I had broken my foot so I can't ride, so could he teach my friend how to ride a motorcycle? We weren't gonna Yeah, so yeah I had That was my first acting job, so um uh yeah, I was like, yeah, my foot's broken, can you just show her how? So he did and we learned, and um, we didn't even have motorcycle helmets. We had brought along a go kart helmet and a plastic football helmet, and we rode the motorcycle. Yeah, like a Houston Oilers or something. Yes, and um, we just were so amused by it was her little brother's plastic football helmet and um and then I ended up selling that And then they sold you a bike with but to some to a young seventeen year old lady limping with the plastic football helmet. Yeah, well they didn't see the helmets that was something we took out of the car. Yeah, yeah, I wore the We didn't want to be pulled over by the copts, of course, so you know, you grab your football helmet and uh, nothing to see here, officer. And so I ended up selling that motorcycle. I had that from when I was seventeen until I was probably twenty three. Wow, is that your primary mode? Um? No, I had a car as well. Um, And then I bought years later, I bought a couple of vintage motorcycles that I still have. But Stephanie no longer will allow such a thing. Like a lot of people go through that thing, especially if you grew up loving evil kin evil and the funds to where at one point I thought about it like, oh man, I know they're dangerous, but they're just so cool. Yeah, and I got married. My wife was like, no, go ahead and get that thought out of your head. So did you own Did I think I kind of thought about it here and there over the years. Well, yeah, Stephanie said, probably before we were together, she would have thought it was fun and cool whatever. But she saw somebody die on our cycle and she said, it just there's no way. If it was before she saw that right, but then after she was like, it's me or the motorcycle. So these theories still out. They collect dust in your garage, they do, Okay, they do. I think I'm gonna get rid of one of them. Yeah, one of their it's one of them's gold and one of them is teal colored. Their Honda CB three fifties and really cool ones on a seventy. The gold one, uh is named Goldie Honda, and the teal one is, um, what's her? What's her? Russell? Kurt Russell? Okay, I thought it was gonna have something to do with teal No, I know that's the setup, and then you fooled you. Goldie Honda and Kurt Russell sit in my Who am I going to? I mean you love them both? Oh? I know for sure? Sell? Um, Kurt Russell, Yeah yeah, Goldie Honda stays yeah. Goldie Honda was the first, and I had that motorcycle. I did like ten episodes or so of Sarah Silverman's first TV show, and um, I had that motorcycle in that show. And so there's kind of an attach, right, what if your sons grew up and they're like, why don't you have two motorcycles for it. My good friend Rick Is he collects motorcycles and he races motorcycles and behind Stephanie's back to the babies, he's always like motorcycles. You guys, get him a sidecar. Those kind of cool. Um, that was a great story, thank you. Uh so the bikers. Well, first of all, we need to talk about Share in that movie. Yes we do, because, um, I don't know anything about shares process in her career, and I may be wrong, but I've always had the feeling that she can kind of be in anything if she wants to be, or at least put herself out there to just act all the time. But she's only done yeah, like five movies. Yeah. I feel like she's could do whatever she wanted to, but it's perfect purposely just sort of been super selective. Yeah. I mean you hear about people be being selective, Yeah, but she really really selective. She's just like, seriously, only the greatest movies ever, That's all I'm doing. Yeah, I mean, which is Eastwick, Mask, moon Struck, of course, the Sunny and Share Show. That's a great movie. Um, but I know that Mask was I think she had us while she was in silk Wood. Uh, and had a small part in silk Wood before this, but this was her first big starring role. And um, and everything that she's in, she's just so good and like real and authentic and um, I like, I've always wanted more Share in my life. Yeah, like movie life. Um, but you know, Share is gonna do what Share wants to do. We can't boss this woman around. No, And apparently Peter Bogdanovitch couldn't either because apparently they um there was some friction because she was sort of new and she wanted her boyfriend played Gar, who was Val Kilmer at the time. So like, after you see Sam Elliott, I mean he is Gar. I'm surprised that's not his name. Uh, like you because remember what Valkimer looked like in eighty five. There's no way he could have pulled that part on Gosh that Gar? Yeah, I mean I know. Do you love that movie? Yeah? I did you just go? Yeah? You know I like it? No? No, no, I love it. Um. And seeing it today it kind of brought back a lot of did it hold up? Yeah? I haven't seen it in a handful of years. It does hold up? It? Um, I think it avoids that like movie of the week thing that it easily could have been because Bogdanovitch was a director and like a really like masterful director and the casting you know. Um, Like, my mom has been in love with Sam Elliott since she was from that generation of uh, mustachioed hunks of the seventies. We're kind of right up her alley. She like Tom Seller, she loved Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds. Uh. In fact, Smoking the Bandit filmed um in Atlanta and shot some scenes across from my elementary school in our station wagon is in one of the scenes. And how did you wait so long to bring this up? Well, this gets even better, she um. For probably twelve years after that movie, in our garage we had the sheriff Jackie Gleeson's card door in our garage. It was knocked off of the car in a scene in the movie, and somehow my dad got it and we had it in my garage and for years until my mom was like, get rid of that thing, get rid of that piece of movie history. But anyway, long story short, she drugged me down one day to meet Burt Reynolds. He did like an autograph day and It's one of those things. You know. I'm like, I don't know, nine or two years old, in line for hours and hours to meet Burt Reynolds, uh and have him like smack is scumming my face, hit me on the chin and sign a thing for my mom. You know what movie history I have, um that I didn't realize was movie history at the time. I used to work for Sam Raymie, and yeah, I was an assistant and I mean not his personal assistant, and I was just an assistant for the company. You hear that, Thomas and so um. Yeah, I remind Thomas near daily about assisting Sam Raymie and let me tell you how it's done. But when I was I think the company was moving out of a building or I was. I can't remember how I acquired Sam Raimi's old um file cabinet, but I acquired I started working for Sam Raimi when he was finishing up A simple Plan Great Man and moving on to he was in he was finishing that, and then he was in pre production on his big, first big movie, which was Spider Man No No Um for Love of the Game with Kevin Costner. So everybody, Yeah, there's one moment where Kevin Costner's hand is bleeding, um and there's like a shot that everyone's like, oh, there's Sam. But um. So I have this um file cabinet, and I remember when I brought it home, I was like peeling all the labels off that said like dark Man and Evil Dead one and Evil Dead too, and did you have it just so you could use it? Yeah? I wasn't even like thinking, this is Sam Raimi's file cabinet, like historic little stickers and um, and I couldn't fully get the stickers off, and I just bailed halfway and just wrote like comedy on one and like it just all these stupid labels that have to do with me. But then years later, um, you know, after he went from just cult iconic director to just like one of the biggest A list directors you can find, I looked at the file cabinet and I was like, thank god, I was unable to fully scrape off Evil Dead and dark Man and all these labels, even though my stupid like comedy label is written on there too. That's pretty funny. It's a funny merging my stuff and Sam Raimi's file cabinet. But I have that like Johnny Ron's base case and I had a bunch of stickers. I couldn't get them off. It's fine. I used it as a planter. So did you do you still have that? Oh? Cool and use it? I do? And now you tell everyone right over it actually hasn't. It's in my garage. So I was forget with Goldie and Curt. It's real. It's a really I need to get share to come over and hang out in the garage. Uh do the same, RAMI do you know him now? Like does he know who you are and that you worked for him? Or uh? Yeah? He Um. He made a couple of short films and he paid for both of them. One is called Clown Service. Yeah, yeah, I saw that he paid for that. He did well a portion of it. Um. And my first short film called Poop Dreams colon a series of stained short I'm certain you haven't. It's not anywhere to be found. You've never heard of this, Thomas. Okay, Sam not only paid for it, but he's in it. Yeah and um and then yeah, he gave a chunk of money to Clown Service. Yeah, because that Clown Service kind of help put you on the map, didn't it? Or did it no, okay, no, it only came out a couple of years ago. I wrote it twenty years ago, and then I started a Kickstarter fund to raise money for it five years ago, and then I had a few bumps in the road in life, installed the production, and then I made it two years ago. I know what I'm thinking of now that I read about it recently because of a controversy. Yes, yes, that's why there is a controversy around it. Yeah, you get ripped off controversy. I just know that I wrote it twenty years ago. I made it two years ago, and it's based on true events from my life, so it might have put me on the map to some people who had never heard of me. I know. The first time I saw you was the Conan O'Brien appearance where you where you shoved the stool around. Um. I was just like, who is this? That is the best thing I've seen and m and uh. Paul Thompkins was the guest that might Yeah, so I'm a fan and sort of friend of his now and that was why I was watching that night. I was to watch Paul and then you came on and did that and I was like, Wow, this is awesome. This is funny because when I when I pitched that idea to the booking agent producer, they were like, I said, so I just want to you know, push a stool around and he was like, well, um, I trust you, but I did you know, I think I need to see it. And I was like, yeah, it just makes no you really need to hear. It makes these squeaky noises. It makes people laugh and then it makes them not laugh, and then they laugh and then they don't. And he was just like, let me, let me just come see this, and um, I was like yeah, sure. And so he came and saw me do it live and he was like, oh my gosh, So that was part of your act for a while. Uh, for a little bit. Yeah, and um and then when I did it, I when I was doing it on Conan, I couldn't get the stool to make the noise is it was supposed to make. So I just went on a leap of faith literally and leapt up closer to where because there was a plexiglass underneath the plexiglass floor or these lights that come up, and so I went over and I was, you know, running running it across the plexiglass and it was just making the sweet sweet. Well, yeah, I think I'd probably told you, yeah, you probably heard it directly from me. Um, but yeah, I I scratched the floor. No, the scratch isn't still there. They had to have it buffed out. But what is still there is the sound of the stool and the one of the sound guys, I guess to annoy ConA will play it every now and then. That's great. Yeah, I think, well it was kind of great that you went up to that second level because then you had Andy and and p F. T. Conan like just dying in the background, so that really added to it. It was really fun. So that was my introduce introduction to you. But but you can watch Clown Service on Vimeo. Now, okay, well that should settle any controversial Um. Two years ago, I do feel like I have I need to mention that we were talking about how great, uh well, how great Gar was, Yeah, and Sam Elliott, but that was the only thing in that movie that kind of took me out of it was. Um, I don't know if you remember, there's the one scene at a party, one of the many biker parties, where he has a mustache, rides shirt on. I don't. Yeah, I didn't. I don't think I probably knew what that meant when I was fourteen, and then I saw it today and I was like, oh, man, like car, it is way too cool to wear a shirt like that. It's like somebody walking around with a hey Man or whatever. Bart Simpson, Yeah, you know, or I don't have a cow Yeah, just like, hey, what are you doing. I remember a friend of my and was on a date and she ran off to the bathroom and called me and she was like, I'm out with this guy and he's wearing Uh, what was that movie the guy that that was filmed I think in Salt Lake City with the kind of nerdy guy. No Thomas said, Wayne's World. By the way, Napoleon Dynamite. I guess he had some Napoleon Dynamite shirt on that thing. Yeah. And my friend was like, am I crazy? But this is such a turn off and I was like, no, it's it's telling of something that's absolutely Yeah, if you choose to wear like it was probably a vote for Pedro. Yes, it was for Pedro. On the first day, first day, you're screaming yeah, because you pick out your clothes for a first day, and you think about it deliberate and you might try a few things on even I'd like to see the rejected outfit exactly. Let's see what t shirts he did not wear. Can I tell you my favorite Gar moment? Yeah, and it's actually my favorite. It's my favorite. Oh, oh my gosh. Right when I started to say it's my favorite moment from the movie, then my brain jumps to other unbelievable performances by Share but Share and Gar together. Um, I guess that's not her movie name, but anyway, it's When, Um, what's her name? Yeah, it's When, Um, And what's her son's name? Again? Bad with names? But I love the movie Rocky Rocky. Rocky has gone off to camp and Rusty is so devastated him and then she's trying to write a letter. And that is a scene that when I would try to describe it to somebody, I would a lot of times start crying. Um, it's so raw her love for this child. And when Gar comes in, any starts to try and right what she's saying, and then he just stops and looks at her and oh man, and are you kidding me? Yeah? I mean, just kill me. Now. Another few of those scenes are when Rocky confronts her about her drug use and she rips up one of his baseball cards and he goes into his room and like it brings on one of his headaches brought on by his bone disorder. And then she goes in there because you know, it's one of those parents kids, the parent of the parent kind of situations, and algy he cares about is for her just to not do drugs, you know. And then she goes in there and does her her thing where she talks to him, uh, to get his headaches to go away, because they go to the doctor and they're like, what do you do and they're like, she she talks to me and they go away. And the doctors are very incredulous about the whole thing, of course because it's an eighties movie, but that scene just devastates me. Are still in gradulous, Yeah, you've got a little experience there. Um. And then the scene where does are the big tough biker with the stutter after graduation tells him that he's proud of him, and that's the only thing he says in the whole movie. I was crying in my room today. It's like in there with the blind strawn crying. Were those were those all the ones that destroyed you? Because I mean there's a major one, just like come on, yeah, no, that's not it. Um, well we may as well. I was thinking you might be a tough little cookie. If that's all that destroyed you, well we should go to Laura Dern. And then Rocky goes to camp for the blind. And um, first of all, that's where like I developed a lifelong crush on Laura Dern. I think everybody says that, Yeah, yeah, that movie kind of did it for me, and I still just adore her. But um, when he well, first when she feels his face and you know, he tells her like he's not handsome. Then he has this thing and she feels his face and says, you pretty good to me. That gets me, yeah, of course. And then when he uh and just look on her face, sweetness and openness. She already knows she loves this guy, you know, and of course his face is everything's going to feel and it seemed perfect to her. It's just so sweet. Uh. And then when she teaches her the colors with the hot rocks and the cool things, Yeah, and like she gets it, she gets, Yeah, it's just disrects me. Yeah, but uh yeah, I mean we should talk about his death. Yeah, it's devastating, devastating. I was weeping this morning. I'm a big sap and a big sucker I got. I don't know when I got so emotional, But um, I have no qualms about breaking down and crying. Yeah, the spirit moves me. I don't think we caught my boohoo session on audio today, obviously, I will. You should watch Mask tonight if you need a good cry. I don't. I'm foo hooed out today. Well, so, as you probably remember in the movie, she um the night before they're having another big biker party and he says that his headache is kind of bad, so he goes in. She goes to bed, and then she gets the call in the morning that he's not at school, and she fucking knows right then, there's no way Rocky wouldn't be in school because he like swept the academic awards. And uh goes in the room and he's there, and she knows he's gone, but she's she's pulling the blinds up and talking to him like, you know, oh my god, it's just devastating too much, it is, and um, she keeps talking to him and then you know, it goes and kind of destroys her kitchen briefly, and it's just so painful because he's this this one bit of light she has in her life. You know, very hard to sit through that scene. And I remember being thirteen or fourteen and just like it wrecked me. Then, yeah, you know, it's a sense of Baptist boy. But yeah, I uh, I don't know if that movie is what started things off for me, but I'm I love movies that just destroy me. I do too. I don't know what it is. I mean, yeah, but that was Catharsis in a way too, I think for me it is. Yeah, probably so just to like be affected so deeply about something you're seeing. I'm not that way with music too, Like any piece of art now can move me to tears, and like a second, it's that I feel like that might be that that first dramatic film, and then it just became you know, I actually don't follow too like comedic movies or things like that. It's just more like York and Dancer in the Dark. Yeah, I'm there. Oh my god, talk about a heavy movie, Please don't cry. Oh jeez. Yeah. But then my favorite thing to do when I leave the movie theater after movies like that, as I'm going down the escalator with other people that clearly just saw that movie, I'm just like, I didn't think it was that funny, you know, or what part? What did you think was the funniest part? And people are just like, yeah, Um, it's always so weird in l A too, because I lived there for like five years, and um, when you hold up in a dark theater, and especially a heavy movie like that, and then you come out and it's always just like you're at the fucking grove or something so alarming trolley goes by it is it's alarming, like a trolley full of touria. Um, it's very disconcerting to me. I remember I left a movie at the Beverly Center one time. I can't remember which one it was. You know, they have like a series of escalators going down there, and uh, this is inconsequential. But I looked out to the side and there was something going on a parking lot across the street, and I went down. It's like, what's going on over there? And so I said, oh, the Go Goes are about to play. It's free. It's like, are you shipping me? So me and my friend like went from this downer movie and we literally walked straight off as the Go Goes stage. It was a little shorty promotional thing that they did like their eight greatest hits and banged it out like yeah and like forty minutes and it was. It was one of those l A things like did this just happen? This is like the best day ever. Oh my gosh, the Go Goes are so great. Uh So I'm here, but I have plenty to say about that. Boy. Yeah, well, I mean you're my age. That was that was our wheelhouse. Yeah, I mean we talked about this march because I don't I think I'm aries Stephanie follows all that. I think it's I'm like pisces cuss or something, But I truly don't know what I'm talking about. And hilariously enough, I don't know what her sign is, and she is astounded every time she finds us out because she talks about her sign all the time, and I never I can't I can't clock that, I can't quite register. It's not anything like that that I follow so you can put a gun in my head and I cannot tell you what Stephanie's sins. Well, we did a stuff you should Know episode about astrology about how it was just bullshit. So don't feel bad. I know. I used to with the next girlfriend of mine. Uh, when we have an argument, she likes because you're an aries and everything I did, I guess it's because you're an aries. And I would always say, so you're telling me that if I was born just one day earlier, everything would be your fault, you know. I mean, it's just I'm baffled by I don't have information on it, and so I don't want to completely slam stuff. My wife believes him, but whatever her sign is really quickly speaking of alternate casting, Um, Kevin Costner, who you mentioned from Sam Ramy's movie was almost Rocky Dennis. Do you want some Costner trivia? I'd love some. Do you know what his production company is called? Boy? Can I get a guess? Sure? Um, Kicking Bird Productions. That's Correct Productions. Really? Why is that? Uh? Something about like his grandmother. I'm not sure, but Kevin Costner was a star of for Love of the Game. When I worked for Sam there was a mix up, two couple of mix ups where cash was livered to me when I would sit at my office that was clearly supposed to go to the production or someplace else. I don't know. I also ended up on a conference call with Kevin Costner and somebody else and looped in. I'm just wondering about the cash. Is that how Costner operates? He just has catched. I think it was just petty cast or something. Yeah, I thought you met like a briefcase. I ended up with an envelope of petty cash that clearly had to do with the production. And then I ended up on a conference call going hello, Hello, who is that? This is Tig, and it was Kevin Costner and somebody else going what do you mean? Yeah? It was a lot of but it was me just really unaware of what was happening. And then I was like, I'm an assistant over at my name is Tig, and you're probably so afraid to miss any meeting like you felt like, well, I never needed in a meeting. Well that's why when you at the conference, they must really need me. Yeah, I was like a call for me, okay, chime, I'd like press conference and then all of a sudden, in on a meeting, when did you hang up from the meeting? After they were like, okay, well you know, can you hang up now? We need to have our meeting when you were politely asked yea, and now could someone actually connect us to TIG Productions and not this buffoon answering the phone at the production office? Is your production company, Kevin Costner Productions? It should be That's a good idea. Robolo was the other person who almost played Rocky. I don't have any trivia for you there, No, that seems like it would have just been weird stunt casting. Like let's take like the most handsome guy in Hollywood, and I can't stand stunt casting, saying I pride myself on with my show, is that we hire who's perfect for the job. Yeah, and we I personally, I am never like I want to get a celebrity. I always wanted to work with this person, and now this is it's easier to buy into. I think, uh for me as a viewer, because like when I saw the guy that played her stepdad, I was like, wait a minute, like I know that face, like I think he was in Ghostbusters. We'll See. That's the thing is if somebody's just like a character actor working actor, I don't care, or if they've never acted, but I do not want to like cram a bunch of famous people. That's weird. And they kind of plays your brother. He's so great, he's so good. Yeah, it's really so great. Second season. I can't wait. How many episodes? Six? Again? Okay? Yeah, that's good, A nice tight like there's no filler episode. No, I feel that way for sure. It um. I watched it with my wife well when I came out, but it was I think people try to do too much these days for more episodes, like anything over ten, and I'm trying to do less. Yeah that's good. Yeah, it's a good goal. All right. Well, let's finish up then with a couple of quick segments. You've been kind enough with your time. I want to call what Ebert said, because Roger Ebert's my favorite movie critic of all times. So I like to go back and kind of see where he landed two thumbs up from Thomas. He gave Mask three and a half stars out of four three and a half. I wonder what the little half problem was. You know what John Watson said the same thing when he got three and a half stars on his movie. He went, yeah, I wonder why he deducted a half a star. Yeah, but I mean, really, what was the problem. I don't know. I guess you just didn't think it was a perfect movie. I'm I disagree. Well, here's this quote. Movies don't often grab us as quickly as Mask does. The story of Rocky and Rusty is absorbing from the very first maybe because the movie doesn't waste a lot of time wringing its hands over Rocky's fate. Mask lands on its feet running mm hmm, not bad. And then five questions and these can be short answers. I kind of I don't even know if I have been named for this yet, sort of like movie going one on one with with Tig and you'll call that segment movie going one on one with Tig. Every other Um, what was the first movie remember seeing in the movie theater? I think it was Star Wars. That's good. I mean we were sick, so we were march. Um first R rated movie that you remember seeing in theater or in VHS or whatever. Oh yeah, I couldn't go near that one. I was. That was so for boating in my life, I would have. Really, I don't think anybody was saying, sure, go ahead and watch it. I think, um, you know, there was just other activities going on at my house that we're more interesting to my mother than monitoring what I was watching up here, watching Parks such a dumb movie, now that what we look back, you know, didn't you know it was a dumb movie when you were watching? No, because I didn't see it until I was much older, because I just thought it was I thought it was like, you know, the sexiest movie ever made, because there were body parts in there that aren't usually shown. And I literally thought it was like the filthiest movie. Yeah. Like I have no recollection of the movie. I just know, yeah, I just I just know I watched it, and I know it was rated. Are Um, will you walk out of a bad movie? Do you remember doing? So? I have. I did walk out of a bad movie? Do you remember it? I do? Are you willing to go on record? I am not. Because a friend of mine was in a and I I was stunned about how bad it was. Okay, and then I saw a bad movie. I think it was not true, and I didn't walk out because my friend and I were laughing so hard that it ended up being so fun laughing in the wrong way. What was that one? Can you say that one? It was Calm cong Skull Island? Oh like the recent thing? Yeah, okay, did you see it? It looked I knew better. Why did you go see that? Well? I love I love the original King Kong movie here and so the original meaning Jessica Lang. Yeah, and so when this movie was coming out, I was I just was hopeful, and my hope was completely annihilated. It supposed to be really bad. It was just me and my friend and two other people in the theater, and I don't know what the other people thought of us, but we were laughing so hard. Yeah, it's oh so funny. It's one of the funniest. I can't believe it. Well, that's good that you stuck it out. You didn't walk out. I wanted to, but then I just also wanted to see how much this would escalate. And it's ridiculous, and yeah, how bad it could get. This movie felt like they turned in the first draft. Nobody gave a note. Everyone was just like, all right, all cameras go and do it. Yeah, let's do it. We wrote the movie. Um, can you name a guilty pleasure movie aside from Under the Rainbow? Point? Um? Like, is there one that you go back to a lot that's just kind of ridiculous and dumb? Yeah? I guess some people think it's ridiculous and dumb. And actually, now that I am and fairly educated adult, I can see some flaws in it in uh, in ways that are not socially accepted, Like it's it's not just socially acceptable, but there's horrendous behavior and you're cheering for an abusive person. Um. But Urban Cowboy that is a nearly perfect film as far as I'm concerned. And that's a guilty pleasure because, um, I just I think I relate to it and connect to it because a lot of like living in Texas as a kid, and that was Houston too, Yeah, and living outside of Houston, a lot of these people look very familiar to me, and the urban cowboys that lived in pent house apartments and drove the big trucks and cowboy hats and and you know, my parents were friends with um specifically this couple that we used to go over to their house. I it felt like that it felt like John Travolta and that new girl he started a date with the hair down to the down the back Crystal who I've seen her live at the rodeo but anyway, so yeah, I would say Irvin Cowboy for sure. I could watch that movie. And I loved Eva Winger Man. She was so good. But she is who I wanted to play my mother on One Mississippi, and she wanted to play my mother and One Mississippi and wrote me this unbelievable email, just desperately wanting this to work. And then she got booked on another show right called The Ranch, which I haven't Ashton Kutcher. It's like a sitcom on Netflix, and then Amazon didn't you know, there was just a lot of like we want somebody that Anyway, it didn't work. But the actress that does play my mother on One Mississippi is so phenomenal. She's great, and it's like one of one of the things like once you see her, like I can't imagine even deva Winger. And I know I already said I didn't want to litter a show with just famous faces, but that wasn't that wouldn't be stunt casting. No, no, Oh, my gosh, Debora Winger nothing better officer and a gentleman still share. I mean those two Share reminds me of my mother. Deva Winger reminds me of my mother. Yeah, my mother was a little bit of a clammy. Well no, she was just she's very beautiful, but she she's wild and a little irresponsible. And so that character in Mass reminded me a bit of my relationship at times with her mother, and I think it's also why it kind of killed me a bit. Yeah, I was before we get to question five, I was going to ask you, was like, what was it about Masks specifically? Um? For you? Yeah, it was the parent child connection and I did feel like a lot of times I was the mature together m HM one and that I it was a lot of times parenting and trying to get my mother to pull it together in different ways, and you know, yeah, never happened, but well that kind of came through on the TV show. I kind of had a feeling that might have been part of it. What do you mean part of your love for Matt the connection to Mass? Yeah, yeah, yeah for sure. Yeah. Share shares portrayal very much reminds me of my mother. But I also really connected to Deva Winger um as my mother because of that, like just passionate, like I'll rip your face off. I love my kids. Deva wing Or share kind of love for their kids. Yeah, for sure, I saw big mistake. I saw terms of endearment believe it or not, for the first time last year on a plane and I had to like put on my sunglasses and like in my seat. And I told my wife after She's like, why the fund did you watch that the plane? Yeah, so you know what that movie is. I was like, I thought I could handle it, but yeah, I could not handle it. Have you seen that? I don't know why it took me so long to see that movie because I loved every wing Orson and Gentleman is one of my favorite movies of all time. And just speaking of wrecking me, yeah, the whole movie wrecked me. Uh And finally, um, what is your do you have like a movie ritual? Like do you kind of sit in the same place or get the same thing at the concession stand? Or oh boy, I have always been somebody that gets popcorn. Well, I love barks root beer barks. You know it's it's from Mississippi. Um, I would always get barks no ice and always feel like, don't don't you even put ice in there because it comes out cold anyway. So just fill up the large one with barks no ice. Yeah, you get so much? Yeah and uh And I don't typically eat like that, but when I would go to the movies and it's like, fill me up big old barks and extra large, big gulp of popcorn and then throw some milk duds into the popcorn. And but now I'm vegan. So Stephanie just reminded me the other day. She's like, our milk days are gone. Inde sit in sort of the same area, or do you care? You know? Um, this girl I dated several years ago, she told me the trick at this one theater in Los Angeles, which, um, well, I don't want to tell you because I don't want in case you're in town, if you're going to see a movie when I'm going to see that all full to bump into me. Now it's I don't want you to steal my good seats. It's at the grove and if you sit with you sit behind where there's um bars. I think it might be a handicap seating is in front, so there's no chairs there. So if there's nobody in a wheelchair sitting there and you sit behind those bars, you can just put your feet on those bars. Yeah. I guess you could be a total jerk and put your feet up there if there's a wheelchair there, but I would highly suggest being a considerate human not doing that. Put your feet down, you slob. But anyway, Wow, so that's your that's your secret tip grove. But I also always have had a fantasy of going to a movie walking to the front the very front rope, you know, Ryder left corner by myself, just in an empty theater that was there. That's John Ronson's move. He sits in the front left seat. I'll see him there. I'll sit on his lap. So strange kind of like to see that. I know we have to wrap up. I will say, this is what my fantasy of I've always wanted to do is go into the grove. Yeah, and just start making announcements to the theater and not work there obviously, and just see how that goes for me. Yeah, see what takes. Yeah, And because the person you know that does work there is going to come in and and need to do the announcements and ask me would you just freewheel it or yeah, just like make sure you get your ticket validated, and you know, no talking, turn off your cell phones, really tell people the rules, you know, please no talk. You know, just bathrooms are over here, and if you have to get up and get it. And then the person the job that is comes in and sees me doing it one day, one day, I'll do it, all right, thanks, thanks for having me. Appreciate you coming in. All right. So how about that Jack Nataro and mask uh mirror seconds after getting the news that she was gonna live very very intense, cool conversation. She is the best. The fact that she soldiered on through this and uh we I feel like we really shared a moment. And I think she even admitted it on the show that she's going to remember this one for a while. So I feel lucky to have to have been with her when she found that news out. Very grateful that this all worked out this way and uh, not a bad way to get the second show off the ground. So I hope you enjoyed it and we will see you next time on movie Crush and until then, Uh, would you mind putting your phone away?
