Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with Charles W. Chuck Bryant Jerry in Studio one A. You just pointed us out to each other as if I was going to be like, who it was Jerry, and it wasn't me Jerry. So I'm Chuck here Chuck, Okay, that's Jerry. All right. That was a little confused, right there, gotcha. Here's a lady. I'm a dude. All right, now that we have that sort of let's talk to you. Uh, or we could change the name of the podcast to two dudes and a lady. Yeah, we could. Maybe that'll be our side cast where we talk about this podcast. Sidecast that's right coined by Josh Clark Circond two thousand. So now you own that. I just put it on wax. Pretty pretty sweet, pretty slick, ye, So Chuck, Yeah, you have or drink tea? I just stuff finished up some green tea. Are you still a green tea drinker? Yeah? I mean I like all kinds of tea, but I uh drank some green because I was studying for this and it just was like, yeah, sure you used to drink it by like the mini pitcher full. Yeah. I used to drink it cold. Yeah, um, you don't need that. I had this hot. Well it is wintertime. Yeah. Do you like? I like green tea. Yeah, I like green tea the most. Um. I like chilled green tea. I don't like woolong, which until I guess today or yesterday, I thought it was long. Did you know it was woolong? I had no idea and I've never had it I have. It's very woody. It's almost like roots, like you put some roots in some water, um, warm water, seep for a while or steep steep. I don't know why I always have trouble with that. It's clearly steep. Seep is different. Yeah, that's a different word. But for my whole life of confused steep and seep when it comes really yeah interesting Uh Anyway, Wolong not the biggest fan. I like green tea and I like it chilled black tea. I'm not really big on. Yeah. I like a good English breakfast tea. Love. Do you or Earl Gray? You like those two sure man little little cream, little sugar. Yeah, And then of course you've got your herbal teas like I don't like this. Are you don't know? I've been drinking celestial seasonings tension tamer So that's actually right. Well no, well that was the big reveal that I was working up to, but just plodding along. But now that you've rushed me, I will agree with you. No, not all those are t right. Those aren't. Here's the really big reveal. Tho, okay, English breakfast tea, green tea, woo loong uh. White tea. Remember that snap a lad where that old man shows the backpacker dude, Oh, it's like a Snapple white tea and he just goes, we put up to the top and it's like that's it and he goes, that's it. That's white tea. All of those are the same thing. They're all the same They come from the same plant. One plant. Did you know that? Um? I did not know that until I've researched. It's a Chamelia senensus is the t plant the tea bushes. Uh. And now we have to say there are different varieties of chamelea sentensus c sentensus is what those in the no call it. Uh. Well, horticulturists, sure, um, but the plant itself. There's one species of key plant, and that's what it's. That's what it all comes from. It's how the tea is made. That that Um explains, explains the differences, and then you know, you add some stuff like apparently Earl Gray has the essential oil of the bergamot orange mixed in, which is nice, but that's still it is t yes, right, it's got something added to it. Now, if he just took burgamot orange, dried it out, put it in a tea bag, and sold it as herbal tea as like orange dream, we wouldn't have tea. The tension tamer, it's not tea, it's a It's a dried herb that you steep or steep depending on your preference in warm water. Yeah, it's a steeped hot beverage. Beverage. That's a good way of saying it, because that's exactly what it is. So the cats out of the bag, which means now that we've done that, we have to explain everything there is to know about tea. That is right. Uh, And I guess there's no better place to start than the seven b C. Of course, and the Emperor of China um No One knows that this story is true. Of course. It's a pretty good story though. But it's a good story because we don't know the exact origin of tea um. It's been around for a long time. But some people say Chinese Emperor Shin nung Um, who ruled about five thousand years ago, was traveling through China and he was big into sanitation. Uh like boil your water kind of sanitation. This is thousands of years before germ theory, which is a couple hundred years old. I wonder what led him to that conclusion, which was spot on. You know, I don't know, I don't know. We're getting the way back machine and ask him, yeah, that's right. Okay, it's a lot of fuel for that one question, but it's a pretty good question because yeah, you're you're right, it's spot on. How how do you know that boiling water kills germs if you don't know what germs are exactly? Uh So he was traveling through China and reportedly stopped to rest and was preparing some boiled water, some delicious boiled water, and a gust of wind blew some leaves from a bush into the water, changing the color, and he was like Hey, this is a different color. Now let me try it well, and it's delicious. He was renowned as a scientist. Yeah sure, he was definitely at the very least securious fella. Um, and yeah, he decided to try it. He's like different colored boiled water. Of course, I'm going to try that and see what it's like. He had his right hand try it first, then five minutes later was like okay, yeah, yeah, exactly. He didn't die. I think that's what all the fat cats did back then. Um. So it turns out that that was debris detritus from the Camelia senensus. He was born. He was born in China. No one knows that that story is true. I think, like you said, um, but it's a pretty great story. And since we don't know the true origin, ty, why not. Yeah, I'll go with that. It's not that far fetched. When the Western Zoo dynasty was around, the tea was a religious offering, and during the Han dynasty it was pretty limited, so it was safe for royalty. Um. By the time the Tang dynasty came around, which was six six eighteen to nine oh seven, they found a bunch uh. They found discovered a lot of more tea plants, and that ironic that t became established during the Tang dynasty. Yeah, that was pretty funny, um, because tang as the opposite of tea, right yeah, I mean they're both water based, so probably not the opposite. I don't know, it would be the opposite of tea. Um. So, like I said, they found a bunch more plants in the Tang dynasty, and the Chinese government actually said, you know what, everyone should drink tea because it's good for you and so, and we can make money off of it of course. Uh. And then from the Tang dynasty it spread to Japan by priests. You were studying in China. They also brought Buddhism at the same time. Both of them took root. The Japanese said we like this, let's try making some other stuff out of it, and that they actually created them teeth ceremony, which is a big deal in Japan still to this day. Have you taken part one of those? I have not. You me took um some classes when she taught in Japan yours back. Um, But apparently it's just one of these things where you you're just constantly learning. It's never you're never like I'm a I'm a master at t You're you're always learning more, you're always trying to be perfect. And the thing that's so elusive about it is it's supposed to be utterly simple. Yeah, it's it's a it's elaborate, but the steps are meant to be simple, Like it's a very simple plane form thing like the sushi rice. It's like, uh, right, why are the Japanese obsessed with doing things really well? They really are that they don't phone it in right, Um. But the whole thing behind the tea ceremony and the Japanese adoption of it is that there's this idea that t share, sitting down and sharing ceremonially and in a ritually, a ritual manner, a cup of tea can bring peace between people. Yeah, what's the the tea ceremony? I know you there's a saying, there's another saying, Yeah, it's a cup of tea with me ichi go ichi e one time, one meeting, which is the idea that every encounter is unique and can't be duplicated. Very nice, That is nice. Um. So in Europe, you know, I think a lot of people associate with tea. Of course, with England and Europe, the UK Britain took a little while though. All those places there was a lag. Yeah, there was. We're in like the seventeenth century now, and the Portuguese were the first people to uh not imports tea, but drink tea in England. Yeah, they were. They were trading in the East Indies, specifically Java and the Dutch. If you'll remember from did we ever do a full nutmeg episode? I think we did right cinnamon too, that this all this showed up back then in the seventeenth century in the East Indies around Indonesia, Java. Um, the Portuguese just had the place on lockdown until the Dutch came in and we're like, we're taken over. One of the things that came out of that was the import or the introduction tea to you Europe through the Dutch. Yeah, they pretty much horned in on their trading routes and brought t to Holland from China, and then from Holland of course it spread throughout Europe. Uh. And I think the King of England at one point married at Portuguese uh woman and the princess, Yeah, princess that had a lot to do with it too. Of course, Charles the Second did married Catherine of Braganza, who was, it says in this article, a t addict and she was like, must drink some tea, man, and uh, all of Great Britain kind of followed suit because back then, once a princess did something, sure, you know, everybody wanted to do that. Yeah, even if she was a fiend of some sort, like a caffeine fiend. Um. So the end of the East India Company's monopoly on trade in China, which happened in eighteen thirty four, was a really big deal because basically they you know, everything was coming from China until then. And then at that point the East India Company said, hey, we could grow our own tea in India and we're gonna start doing it. Uh And they did, and by eight thirty nine they had enough cultivation going on, um that they had the first auction of a psamte in Britain, which is that's a big deal. That's the variety that they used to make Darjeeling tea. How was it? And I think their number two in production today right Yeah, India, China, Kenya and Sri Lanka are the big four tea producers the Indonesia. I think it's fifth, and they're like, can't you just say top five? You don't produce Well, they do produce a lot, but not nearly as much. Uh. The other thing too that happened during that the monopoly was, um, the tea Clipper was born, which is pretty neat. When the company had the monopoly, there was basically no rush to get it there because they had the monopoly, like, you'll get the tea and you will sail over there and will all be good. Have you ever heard of Slow Boat to China? Is that where it came from? Cold? What about High Road to China with your boy Tom Selleck? Well, oh yeah remember that movie? I never saw it. Yeah, it wasn't very good. That was his brief foray into a major motion pictures. Didn't he play like the King of Spain in one of the Columbus pictures back in the early nineties? I think I remember that? Yeah? What was that either or Columbus? Yeah, I can't remember. So the t Clipper, yes, uh, there was no rush, but until when that monopoly ended, it was basically like the fastest boat to get there, the fastest ship will be the one that gets the sail. So they started making these uh these new ships that were had huge sails and tall masts could go a lot faster, and it started the era of the t clipper races. Um. Basically, you would leave the Canton River in China, go down the China Sea, across the Indian Ocean, slink around the Cape of Good Hope, up the Atlantic, pass these oars and into the English Channel. Then you were to to up the River Thames by a tugboat, and the first boat to throw their their load up on the docks would be the winner, which is pretty neat until they built the Ses Canal and then it was like, well, out of that, it sounds like a pretty great race though, Yeah it was. Yeah, I wonder how long that took. I think they were just holl And but the whole time too. Yeah, but even still had to take weeks, you know, I would think, so, um, and this we should say this is the that was the mid nineteenth century. Um. The we would be remissed to do an episode on tea and not mention the Boston Tea Party, which was a thing. Everybody knows about the Boston Tea Party. What I didn't realize is that the British Royalty, the British Crown still, even after losing the colonies in part over tea taxes, UH, still continue to just tax the heck out of tea for for at least a decade afterward before they finally relented and started to like drastically reduce it in the face of tons and tons of piracy and smuggling. Apparently, in the late eighteenth century, UH seven million pounds of tea were smuggled into Britain and five million pounds were legally imported, so the smuggling there was more smuggled teeth than legal tea in Great Britain in the late eighteenth century. Right. But apparently despite all this, it wasn't until nineteen sixty four that the Brits, the British government finally said, you know what, We're gonna stop fiddling with the t tax and just not tax tea anyway. Was this nineteen sixties, Yeah, nineteen sixty crazy, Yeah, tea it's huge in Britain. Yeah. And at this point in the late nineteenth century is when I think the average UH Britain was consuming about six pounds a year per person. It's a lot of tea. Yeah, I wonder what that would be today. I meant to look that up. Is that what harvest? Dry harvest or man? Is that a seeped tea bag? It's not seeped. That's a lot of tea. Yeah, there's a lot of man. So Chuck, we got the history under our belt. We'll move into how tea is actually made after this. Okay, buddy, we were talking about the history, and then before that we mentioned that there were four main types of tea, green, black, woolong, wu tang, and white tea. I just don't understand how O O l O n g is woolong. It's oolong. I guess the w is both. It's invisible but not silent, you know. And like we said, all those teas come from Camellia sinensis. Uh, and there's different varieties of them. The awesome makes start dealing. Um, But the way that you process the leaves is where the differences come about. Right, that's right. What's interesting to me is all t almost all tea in the whole wide world is harvested by hand. Yeah, like uh, I think, um, what was the spice we were talking about? Saffron? Saffron? Yeah, I think n make too. When did we talk about saffron? I think I mentioned it in the Cinnamon podcasts. It's expensive because it can only begin harvested and anytime you're involving people, it's gonna cost more than some big, stupid machine that can do tons of it at once. And that is certainly the case with t because there are only a couple of harvest a year, the first flush in the early spring, the second flush in the summer. And they they really care for the tea plant. They pick and prune at them year round, but they only choose what a couple of leaves from each plant when they're actually harvesting. Yes, so they they're the top two leaves and the bud in between. That's your tea. Everything else is just basically the home for the tea that's harvested. Like the rest of the plant, This huge enormous like plant bullush shrub is just there to like sprout out these little bits and the little sprouts or the tea that we drink. It's amazing, And that's all the tea. That's the oolong, that's the black tea, that's the white tea, that's the green tea. That's all of them. It's from these shrubs, just the top two little white leaves in the bud, that's right. And from there, once they're picked by hand, uh, they are taken to the factory, which is on the plantation because something starts happening as soon as you pick it, and that's called oxidation. And oxidation needs to be very controlled because it's not necessarily a bad thing, because it actually is partially why you get certain varieties of tea, right. Yeah, depending on the kind of tea you want either want oxidation or you want to prevent oxidation. And we should probably say oxidation basically is when UM any kind of molecule, but specifically an oxygen molecule UM or O two uh interacts with something like UM the metal in a car, or the inside of an apple, the leaf off of a t shrub. Um. Once the oxygen interacts with it, it starts to chain reaction inside where these oxygen molecules that have to pair or two unstable or unpaired electrons. Once the oxygen interacts with some other atoms in the cells of these things, it robs those atoms of their electrons, right, because it wants to pair up and when it does this, it starts the process of oxidation. Yeah, which is actually John Fuller or old Buddy wrote this one. Uh and he was a big t guy, big imagine he still is. Um he he's characterized it as actually burning it. So like when you eat your apple bite and you go to your desk and you leave it there, and then you go to the bathroom for an hour or so, you come back. The reason your apple is brown now is because you've exposed that inside to the to the O two and it's burning it. Yeah, because normally the apple, the inside of the apple is protected from the oxygen in the air we breathe in the atmosphere by the skin. Once you puncture the skin, when you break the skin, it's exposed to oxygen and that process of oxidation takes place. The same thing happens with a leaf from a t shrub. When it's attached to the shrub, it's protected from the outside air. Once you pluck it from there, and especially once you like break it or tear it apart or do something with it, it's exposed to that air and oxidation takes place and it withers in very much the same way that UM a leaf on a tree, a dead leaf in the fall withers and changes color. That's oxidation as well. Yeah, the same like you said to the same thing, like that can happen to a car if you don't get that true code. Yeah, that's why you pay thousands and thousands of dollars more the dealership for that true. That's right. Uh. Black tea is the leader of all teas that counts for about production and uh, like you said, the Earl Gray or the English breakfast tea, that's black tea. UM. And it's not always I mean, doesn't necessarily look black. It's kind of a reddish brown when when you seep it. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I'm not gonna help out your problem, am I. And then no, I'm just gonna confuse you. I thought I might knock it out today, but now it's gotten worse. I think. Actually you've also said too long a couple of times. Yeah, that's kind of my choice. Okay. Um, So with black tea in particular, that's like the um the oxidation master, that's right, that's the one you want oxidation for. Uh. So with the actual process of making tea, of processing tea leaves into black t you're actually inviting oxidation. Um, and you're doing that. Well, you want to talk about how you how you make black tea? Yeah, it's a it's a five step process. I mean, there's a couple of methods, but they both include generally these five steps. Yet one is by robot and the other is by yeah, human hand pretty much the Orthodox method and the CTC or the cut tear curl method, which sounds cool, but it's not um because Orthodox is you know, by hand, which means it's better. Uh. And all of this again is it takes place in the factory on the plantation grounds after the human hands have harvested the tea leaves and brought them to the factory. A couple of fields over. Okay, the first step is withering, and that's when you're gonna spread it out and let them wither. Like we're talking about with the leaf that falls, it's just basically losing moisture. Yes, after that, you've got rolling where if you're using the Orthodox method, the human hand method, you're actually rolling out and pressing the leaves so that you're kind of pressing the moisture out, but you're also simultaneously pressing some of the oils, those beneficial oils inside the tea leaf out so that they stick to the outside of the leap, so they're kind of retained and dehydrated. Yeah, and if if you're doing the hand method, you it's a gentle process. You're trying not to break the leaf. With the CTC method, they're just chopping it up. And you know, because it's a big dumb machine, right and with with say other types of tea, you wouldn't use that method because when you do chop it up, you're exposing it to oxidation even more. Right, you're right, which is part of the part of the process that's actually the third step is oxidation. So after the leads are either pressed by the orthodox method or cut by robots, it's left out in a kind of a damp, cool space to basically oxidize even further, to turn copper turn brown with her and then lose the rest of their moisture. That's which is a good thing in the case of black tea. Yes, from here you're gonna dry it out with some hot air and the color is gonna change even more, uh, from that copper that came from the green. And now you've got your brown and your black color and going on. And then you put the leaves by size and by quality, or if it's going to become say bag tea or something, it's chopped up almost into like a powder. Yeah, kind of just little tiny bits and then bagged and all that stuff. But if it's just loose leaf, then it's sorted by by size and quality. That's right, then you're gonna pay more for it. Yeah, And that's black tea, and that's the tea produced in the world goes through that process, either by human hand or by robot hand. Green tea is next, and that, like we said a million times, is from the same plant. So cool, It is very cool. But basically what happens here is it's pretty much the same process, but you're just not oxidizing it as long because you're going to steam it or I didn't know this, you could pay for it, I guess if you're just growing your own tea and doing it in your house. Uh. You just saw Chef, right man. That was a good movie. He's very good movie, way better than Birdman. The only thing I didn't like a spoiler yeah, about Chef was the whole the whole social Oh yeah, that was like a little weird underwritten by Twitter. Yeah it didn't. It was a little weird. I thought it was just strange that they're like willing to date the movie totally that much. You go see it in ten years, you'd be like, this is so two thousand and fourteen. Yeah. I thought it was not necessary either. But anyway, good movie. It was a great movie, and I thought it's still fit. It's just thinking ten years down the road, it's gonna be odd like the movies that talk about my Space. Yeah, you sad, sad movies. Um, but where were we We were drying out, we were well, you were seeing you. We're saying. And this is the point of steaming. Is it stops oxidation? Yeah, and keeps it green, hence the name green tea. And it's not just the um the tea leads themselves are green or greenish they're supposed to be, but also it imparts a greenish hue to the actual brood tea as well. Um. And the way that the green from the original green color of the leaves is kept as from preventing oxidation, and that's that's done by steaming. And I looked everywhere to see how steaming prevented oxidation. I couldn't find it. I think it's one of those things where people are just like, yep, it does it. Everyone's content to basically stop right there, and I'm like, no, how And I tried to reword at a couple of different ways, and I'm like, okay, how does heat prevent oxidation? Couldn't find that either, But apparently that's what it does. So I don't know if it seals the cells off, maybe atterizes them somehow, and it prevents the oxygen from getting to it from someone. Yeah, if you know how steam prevents oxidation, please let us. But as far as as far as we can tell, it actually does, that's right. And uh we should point out here that it's there can be a range in hue. Um, there can be a yellowishue sometimes. And there's actually something I didn't know about that you told me about yellow tea. Yeah, so supposedly, um, the steaming process can go a little awry, or it used to back in the day more frequently. Yeah, and it produces another um type of tea. Uh it's called yellow tea. And that's like sold, you can get it now. I don't know I'm sure there's some specialty store that sells yellow tea. Yeah, yeah, um, all right. So basically at this point, green tea is um after it's frozen in time and staying green. The process is about it, and the process from there's the same as with black tea pretty much. Yeah, you're gonna sort it, you're gonna cool it, you can dry it out, you're gonna sort it again and then sort it one more time. A lot of redundancy in creating green tea. And now we're at Wolong or Oolong, which is basically like it's kind of like yellow tea. I don't think they're one and the same, but it's a it's steamed, but it's steamed after the oxidation process has taken place to it to an extent, So it's oxidized but not as much as black tea, and it's steamed but not as early as green tea. So Oolong is between the two. What's crazy is it doesn't taste like black tea or green tea at all. It's definitely its own thing. Still, it's from the same plant. I don't think I've ever had it at all. Yeah, I need to just try something see what all the fuss is about. If you go to like a like a Lawson's, which is a chain of um convenience stores in Japan, strangely enough, you can go in and pretty much anywhere you can buy like water, green tea and Oolong tea like in a cooler like you can get it everywhere, those three things, and you should try all of them. You have to try along at least once. Yeah, I'll try some tomorrow. Okay, that's my that's my dedication to you, sir. Uh. Then you have your white tea and that is very much a specialty tea and somewhat rare, and it is only picked two days out of the year when the buds aren't open yet, and it's um it's less grassy, it's a little smoother, but it is similar to green tea. And it has only been available outside of China for um, not that long, just a few years, right, Snapple has only been making it for a couple of years. Well, well that should date it immediately, um like Twitter dates chef. Uh. And it was reserved for Chinese nobility because of you know how rare it is. But um, now you can get it. And we talked about um other kinds of tea two Like herbal tea again is just basically dried herbs that you steep just like regular tea. Like chai chai is actually tea, that's right, because it's tea mixed with spices like cinnamon and pep or and stuff. So that's still constitutes tea. But like camerameal t it's not really teah. It's it's insane, right um, And it's just again, it's just some dehydrated cameramel flowers that you steep in hot water. Um. Same goes for ruey boss, which is a mouthful, but it means red bush and Afrikaans. That's right. Same with mate, which is not to be confused with macha. No, but we'll talk about macho right, Yes, let's talk about macha chuck because I love the stuff I had not been Uh maybe you can call me a macha poser or jumping on the macha bandwagon. Yeah, I in that article you sent it said that like it's the darling of the t set. Now. Yeah, And um, my friend in California, PJ and l A. You've met p J J. He uh he is or was? He may have bailed on it. But he was trying to make his own special macha green tea and bottle it and sell it. I know what you mean, but I don't think he got past making it at home stage. Well, there's a lot. There's not a lot to it, but there's Again, I think the Japanese taste ceremony is surrounded or surrounds macha. That's what you're preparing is macha and all mucha is. It's like really really good green tea that's been ground down to a fine powder by hand, which automatically makes it more expensive than any other teas or most other teas. Um. And what you have is this really fine, beautiful green powder and you put like a teaspoon up in a bowl or a cup or something like that. Uh. And you're supposed to sift it. I think through like a sifter. Yeah, um, just to open it back up again. Sure, make it pop. Uh And then you add some hot water and then you use a whisk to stir it. Yeah. And there's um. I don't think we mentioned that. The other big difference with macha is is that bushes, Uh, the bush are covered twenty days prior to harvests from sunlight and that's the big distinction, and that means it's gonna have a lot more chlorophyll and something called lanine. Oh, that stuff is good. That's just the amino acid that UM. Apparently that's what allows you to feel both um invigorated and calmed. Yeah, it works in conjunction with caffeine. UM. And it's actually capable. It's an amino acid, like you said, that is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier. So like when you drink it, it goes right to your brain. It doesn't have to be um converted and metabolized, right, and it supposedly has all sorts of cool benefits like um cognitive enhancement. Um. You're just kind of clear. It's just neat stuff. Well, and that's what the macha proponents will tell you, Like, have some of this stuff. Man, it's like go juice. You'll be clear headed. Take a hint of this um. But Macha's there's a couple of forms. There's the yasucha and the kotcha. There's at the coicha probably coecha ki chaicha. Uh you sucha is thin tea and coecha is thick tea. And the coecha man that is something else that is made with half the water twice the macha. That sounds like my kind of macha. Well, they say, by the end, by the time you're you're done whisking it, it's gonna be like the texture of paint. Serious macha. Yeah, because macha has like a distinct taste. Oh yeah, I love it. I mean I'll make like, uh, I get it at the Asian market near my house, and I will just add it to my regular green tea, Like I'll whisk it up and then just add it there. It's a suspension. It's not a you're not actually uh, you're drinking the tea leaf. Like if you mix up your match and then leave it there a few hours later, it's gonna be separated. Yeah. So it's a colloid. Is that what that's called? I think so. So I'm not gonna repeat that because I'm not positive. Is it a callid? I believe so, like quicksand colloid is something yeah, something that's like it's not actually dissolved, it's just mixed together. I think you are right. So it's it's a colloid. And um people proponents will say that it's better for you because when you see tea ice cream, you when you sip steep tea right, um, you're only getting you know, I don't know the percentage, but you're only getting some of the benefits of the tea because the tea leaf is still in there with the macha. You're actually ingesting the tea leaves. I see, you know what I mean? Yeah, and that jam goes right past the blood brain barrier. And it does. And it's pretty trendy too, because you can now get a restaurants and they'll be like macha sprinkled on a food dish. Or have you been to Umi Sushi yet? No? I went to Kraft as a Kaya the other night though, So where was is that in Krugs? Yeah? Is it good? It was really good and actually had a cocktail. Thought about you because you know I don't oh yeah, you don't drink that much. It was It was good. It was bourbon and like lemon and ginger. It's uh tie spice like one other thing maybe honey. It was pretty tasty bad. It was good. It sounds good and the food was excellence. It's a little pricey, but it's you know, like when you eat the sushi it's you can so tell the difference. It just melts in your mouth very very much the same with Umi Sushi as well. It's just just the quality between that and just about every other sushi you've had, is it's just light years beyond. Yeah, it is really evident. When you tasted I had some of the albacore and it was just like it was literally like melted butter. I'll bet it's so good. Well, the point is, Umi Sushi makes a green tea Macha souflet with cremon glaze that actually you me replicated once it was it's amazing. It's amazing. So Macha really goes with a lot of really good stuff. Even though it is trendy, it's still good. It is good, and it's like you say, it's super earthy. It's just I recommend you try it. I like a lot, So I don't know if I'm getting the good stuff from that Asian market. It's probably the cheap stuff, but it's still tasty. I honestly don't know if it's one of those things where like you get what you pay for, if a lot of it is just checked up price because it is much or what. I don't know Now, this stuff is pretty inexpensive that I get. Actually for what for the amount you're getting, it's really not that cheap now that I think about it. Yeah, okay, yeah, it's a little canister of it. Yeah, it's pretty small. You're probably paying what you should be. Uh. We talked a little bit about the blood brain barrier, but we'll talk more about the health benefits a tea right after this. So, Chuck, we're going to talk about the health benefits as I said before the break, but first let's talk about how to prepare tea. Well, yeah, there's a couple of ways, depending on what you're you're dealing with. You can either be a loose leaf person or a bagged tea person. And I got the impression from this, Like you said, Fuller was a tea guy, and he he did a very good job of trying to reserve judgment. But you, if I remember correctly, he was a loose leaf guy. And it comes through in this um this article. The loose leaf is better. Yeah, he had a special little unit there where he poured the water in. It kept a loose leaf separate, but it was all contained in one like cup that you screw it lit on or something. Yeah, you can get those or you can just do there's all sorts of equipment you can have to make your tea, you know. So the if you're preparing tea in a bag, you just pop it in some hot water. Well, not necessarily depends on the kind of tea for what temperature do you want your water to be? And I didn't know this Black tea is the only one where you want it boiling at two hundred degrees wolong You're gonna u is the next and that's about one nine, which is close to boiling. Yeah, or you know, you just use your finger to determine whether it's one degrees. Uh, Green and white tea, Um, it's just steaming water. It's only about a hundred and seventy degrees and um, you're black tea. I'm sorry. Black and White take the longest to seep in steep at four and a half to five minutes. Um wu long is about three to four and green tea, man, you can get that stuff going in thirty seconds. Boom, and you're drinking it. My tension tamer takes seven minutes to steep. It says on the box what it does. It can you tell the difference. It's a tame your tension. Yeah, I actually can. That's good. It's pretty neat. I can't remember what's in it, but it talks about the active and green whatever the dried herb is. But um, with with the difference between bag tea and loose leaf tea has a lot to do with the benefits from it, right, so with the C t C method, which again of the world's te um A lot of that undergoes the CTC method because it's black tea, right, But you get like this powdery, chopped up, little bitty substance and it's put into a bag and it forms a little clump and water doesn't circulate as well. The benefit of um, loose leaf tea is that, um, the water steeps through, yeah, steeps through uh and circulates amongst the tea leaves more like, man, I think you're right, But it circulates among the tea leaves, and the tea leaves remember, especially depending on the type of tea, may have been pressed so that the oils are trapped dehydrated on the surface of the tea leaf. You chop those things up and turn them into dust, you're gonna lose a lot of that stuff. But if you have just a dried tea leaf that is dehydrated and has the moisture on the outside, and some water rehydrates that and it just kind of stirs it up and gets into the into the colloid and you drink that, Bam, you're gonna get If there are health benefits which will explore, you're gonna get them, you're more likely to get them from that loose leaf tea than a bag tea, agreed. Uh. And then of course you also have your iced tea here in the South, sweet sweet iced tea. Yeah, which is delicious to me because I grew up here. A lot of people think it's weird. Uh. They had been drinking iced tea before nineteen nineteen o four. The St. Louis World's Fair was where it really took off because the guy was selling hot tea named Richard block block Enden. I know what a name, I know, and he was even if you pronounce it the other way like bletchened in, it doesn't matter. He sounds like a made up mad magazine staff, right or something. Uh. He was serving free tea. But it was hot, and it was really hot, and so people were like, no, thanks, So he made it cold and they said, this is delicious. Well, it was hot out in St. Louis that year. That's summer. That was where I think hot dogs, hamburgers and ice cream cones came from. And apparently iced tea, man. Could you imagine like the world changing after that in St. Louis. Uh So, that's where they credit iced tea being born. And of course here in the South, like I said, you dump a cup of sugar in there while you're brewing it. That makes it delicious and syrupy sweet. Did you read the Slate article that was linked to in here? I started to um, Scott Peacock features in it. Who's that? Oh he used to cook at Watershed? I don't know. He's good, yeah, good cook. And I got as far as page two when they compared the hospitality of offering sweet tea to passing a dub at a fish show, and I was like, no, I'm done at this Slate article forever. What Yeah, what a weird thing to link together. It was that kind of article. It's so strange because there's like a thousand hospitable things you can mention, you know, out of nowhere. It's very strange. Um all right. So finally, Josh, health benefits of tea true or not true? Jury's out, man. So it's possible. If the free radical theory of aging is correct, then it's it's got health benefits and ages. So people hear these things a lot, like antioxidants free radicals, and I don't think a lot of people have an understanding what it is. And it's not super complicated. No, it's not. And I will explain it on the um on the basis of you agreeing to doing free radicals episode whole episode. Sure, okay, cool, why would why would you say it like that? I'm just teasing, so chuck with free radicals, right, And we already mentioned oxidation. That's what the free radicals are based on. So you breathe oxygen and that O two molecule has two unpaired electrons, while those electrons want to be paired, so they go into your body and mess with your cells by searching around for other molecules or atoms that they can steal an electron from and repair repair get it. But it's actually the opposite of pairing. It's damaging the cells because those atoms that just got their molecules stripped are now looking for their own electrons to pair with, right, and it causes this chain reaction. Well, the whole free radical theory of aging is that this is why we age, This is where disease comes from. This is how our system wears down and breaks down cellular destruction. Yeah, and we know that this is a real thing. Sure, Like that really happens the same thing as being exposed to radiation. It's a chain reaction where um molecules and atoms just go around charged looking to neutralize themselves by pairing their electrons their charge electrons. Right. So what T is lousy with is antioxidants. Yeah, and that's what people hear that word a lot and don't even know what it is. It basically it's just gonna slow down that oxidation process because they can give up their electrons and still be fine, exactly like vitamin C catekians which is um which is found in high amounts, and tea, beta carotene, vitamin E. Just basically anything that you see is an antioxidant probably is an antioxidant. Again, the jury is just out now based on some recent studies that have found we don't know if this is actually a good thing. Well yeah, and when it comes to t they people think basically it's a certainly not gonna hurt you, um, and be it's probably helping you. But we just don't know exact actually how and it's not all super confirmed. But drink tea and eat fruits and vegetables because any occidents we think are pretty good for you, right, because it is correlated with a bunch of health benefits. It's correlated with a reduction in um uh, diabetes. Uh, It's correlated with a reduction and I think every pressure. Yeah, lung cancer, um, the lowered risk of lung cancer, heart disease, cholesterol, Yeah, just tons of stuff. There's all these correlations down. They've never proven definitively that it's not that people who drink tea tend to also lead healthier lifestyles and that it's something else. But there's a lot of evidence there that drinking tea does have some sort of healthful benefits or at the very least it's not gonna hurt you. Yeah. When when they say it's they associate it with good health, then that's a pretty good sign that you're doing the right thing. They just can't say we can prove this because this does this. Yeah, and we know it so. Right. So if that free radical theory of aging is true is correct, um, and antioxidants are actually good for you, then the tea you want to go for the drink is the Green Tea because that's the one that has the highest concentrations of catkins, which include epicate akin, epicatekin galleate, epic gallo catekin, epic gallo catekin galley, which is known as E G C G and has a lot of gall I thought that was kind of funny. But Black Tea has these, but they actually convert to other stuff. They're kind of like dumbed down version. So Green Tea again, it sounds like if you really want health benefits, if there are health benefits, you want to drink loose leaf green Tea right with the Mata chaser exactly. T also does contain caffeine. Um. I don't know why people some people think it doesn't or that it contains very little. Uh. I've heard people say that before, like, you know, he's got caffeine. TA doesn't have caffeine. Yeah, he's got plenty of caffeine. Um. But generally not as much of as coffee. Um Coffee contains about eighty two twenty milligrams for a mug, and he's gonna have twenty to sixty, with black being the strongest at about thirty to forty milligrams, and green tea and woolong between ten and twenty milligrams. White tea has like one per cent of the caffeine of a cup of coffee. I want to give a shout out to my coffee too. By the way, you know what we're on the CUSPUB, don't you know? The USDA advising Americans to drink coffee, to drink up to five cups. Five cups of coffee a day. In America right now drinks less than two a day on average, and the USDA is about to say you need to more than double your coffee consumption because it's not only not bad for you, it's good for you. Finally, on the CUSP, everyone is realizing, well, the there's a there's a group that's I can't remember the name of it, but it's it's they come up with the guidelines for our diets. And it's this panel that's the Star exactly, the Star Chamber says, actually, we should start drinking a lot more coffee. And the USDA rarely ignores the advice of the panels. So we're on the cusp of the u s d A saying go drink more coffee everybody, and everyone will be like, Josh, what's right. Yeah, he's the only got drinking coffee before this announcement. Even I don't drink five cups a day on average, really not anymore. I'm trying to step it up. I have started drinking more coffee lately, actually because we got get a little machine here. Now that that machine is dynamite. Yeah, what I do is I hit the regular coffee button and then add a shot of espresso because that makes it the right um size and strength, right, because the regular cup of coffee is it's not even the three quarters of my mug. And it's not even a big mug. Yeah, it's not like some giant mug. No, that's your tea mug. That's my team mug. You can punch through a concrete wall with that coffee with the espresso shot on top. Yeah, it's good though. Uh. If you want to know more about tea, go drink some tea. You can also type T T E A into the search bar at how stuff works dot com. Uh. And since I said search bar, it's time for listener, ma'am. I'm gonna call this left handed feedback. And boy did we get a lot of it. I don't know why. I guess sometimes when you segment a certain part of the population, they're gonna respond, especially one that's been so mistreated for so many, so many years. Yeah, because we heard from a lot of twins and redheads when we covered that stuff. But boy, we heard from a lot of lefties. Um, they're proud people. As it turns out. Hey, guys, I am left handed. When I was little, my mom made me use scissors with only my right hand because of my aunt mothers sister, who is also left handed. She's very into sewing and left handed sewing scissors are crazy expensive. Um, or at least they were back then. They're not. It's bad now. In order to avoid the same ordeal, they thought it would just be better to teach me to cut with my right hand, to never buy the expensive left handed scissors of any kind. I still have mixed feelings about this, but I don't think it harmed me. We did hear from a lot of people who were forced into right handedness from parents or teachers or whatever. Yeah, it was a thing to to It's so bizarre. I think like there was a concerned, widespread effort to eradicate left handed people. One thing you only mentioned briefly though, in the right hand dominances with things like scissors and spiral bound notebooks. I'd also like to point out less obvious ones, like which side the papers on in bathrooms? You never thought about that. Yeah, it's on the left though in most bathrooms, isn't it? Yes it is, but that makes sense. But I reach over with my right hand with tear the paper. I know, but you're ah, you're different. Yeah. Um, door knobs, computer mouse or mice and the smeariness of pens um all can cause issues for lefties anyway. Love the podcast, guys, especially ones about people like me. So Sharon and Sani Tennessee what else about you can we talk about on a podcast? Yeah, let us know. And if you have something about you that you think would make a cool podcast, a whole podcast, let us know. What If she wrote back and I was like, oh gosh, I love lasagna and I hate dogs, and I drive a dots and to drive a dots and do a podcast on that on the dots and dots and drivers. Uh well yeah, let us know Sharon right, It was Sharon right. Share and if and other people out there who aren't Sharon let us know too. If you have any ideas, you can tweet to us at s y s K podcast.
