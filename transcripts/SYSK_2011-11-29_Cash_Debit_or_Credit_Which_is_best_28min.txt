Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff You Should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Uh, and we are coming at you the Stuff you Should Know. Yeah, this is a public service edition. We do a few of these every now and then. Yeah, we want to make sure that you consumers out there are well taken care of, and we feel like we're the guys to do it, us and Clark Howard at least right now. Actually, I want to go ahead and issue a c o A that you mean demanded I issue. Uh. I am in no way, shape or form qualified to give anyone financial advice of any type whatsoever because you don't understand it or you're just not good with I'm I just I don't know enough about it. I'm just a caveman. Your were frightens and confuses me. But this is pretty straight up cash credit or debit. Plus there's also the the the clincher at the end where I say, hey, man, do what you want. Well, that's true, So there you go. At the Yeah, spoiler. At the end of the day, It's depends on the context. Sometimes cash is great, sometimes credits great. Sometimes debit's great. Although I went back and read this and I'm like, I clearly favor personally debit cards. I just think they're better. Yeah, but we'll we'll get into this. Let me I have an actual news topic intro this time. So there is a lady named Lorie Black. She's thirty two. She lives in Auburn, Massachusetts. Okay, I don't know where that is. Plbert Hodgman does. Yeah. Probably as a matter of fact, let's bring him in to answer, John, come on in, have a seat. Not so, No, he's not here. Okay, Well, anyway, we'll find out some other time. Where Auburn, Massachusetts, half of already has just went sweet and half of them went no. Um. Lori Black is a thirty two year old unemployed or out of work preschool teacher from Auburn, Massachusetts, and she also has the unlikely credit of having fifteen black Fridays under a belt. That's where the blimp attacks is Super Bowl. She's got fifteen of those under her belt, and her whole thing is that she can't afford to do this herself. But she is such a junkie for this kind of thing that she's come up with a great way to get in the game, get in the Black Friday game and not break her record, um and make a little bit of cash. And that is to be a Black Friday mercenary. So hold on, let me get this straight. You're saying that she has attended that many like Walmart openings or whatever. You're not openings, but the shopping experience, the kind where like she's the kind where you camp outside and and I thought about this, I'm like, well, I mean a lot of people like to do that. And I didn't realize in this This article from um daily Finance dot com points out that she lives in Massachusetts, and when Black Friday comes around in Massachusetts, you are for freason if you're camping outside waiting for a store to open. So what she's saying is like, I'll go stand in for you. I will go through the elbows, I will go I will bring my stiletto, and um, I will get you those deals that you want. You stay at home and stay toasty. And she's also figured out that nursing home patients who love Black Friday deals. Um will probably be her biggest clientele. You stay in bed shut ends. No, she's not praying on shut and she's offering a valuable service for of the total value of the purchases she makes for your stuff. Even yeah, I thought she just held and she goes shopping for you. She does everything. She's by Friday mercenary. So if you want to hire Lori Black, you can find a Craigslist add that she posted. I guess look for first, go to Google maps or Yahoo Maps or whoever maps and look up Auburn, Massachusetts and find the closest big city, and then go to Craigslist and go to that big cities. I don't know what posting, but you'll find it. I'm kind of curious about does she take on more than one person? I wonder is there a guarantee of how much they need to spend? Because if she's doing all this for a hundred bucks, then no, I don't think she'd do it for a hundred bucks, although she may be such a lover of Black Friday that hey might as well. So she's crazy, is what you're saying. I think she's a she's an eccentric person, but not really crazy. I'm sure she's very nice. Fifteen Black Friday sixteen. Here's pulling for Lorie Black to make that to to keep her streak unbroken. You're rooting for Yeah. So my big question is is if you're Lorie Black and you are using your own money that people are going to pay you for in return, what's the best thing you can use while you are standing outside of Black Friday Target midnight. Well that depends, so let's get into it. Uh, there are advantages to each, their disadvantages to each, Josh, and we'll go over those right now. Cash is anonymous. Yeah, if we're a drug dealer, Yeah, some people like the fact that you're not. Your purchases aren't being tracked if you use cash. Um. In my family, we like that our purchases are tracked because then you can look at your budget each month and say, this is where we're spending this, this is where we're spending this. You can still do that with cash, but that means you have to be You gotta keep up with all that stuff yourself instead of having your bank account program doing it for you. It's true. Um. There's also there's also a proof of ownership that cash in no way, shape or form has That's right, Remember and die hard with the German terrorists, where after was um unmarked bearer bonds same as cash. They weren't terrorists, they were common thieves. No, they were exceptional thieves. Right, that's exactly right in the Nakatomy building which is in Century City. So yeah, if your cast is gone, your cast is gone. Right, proof of ownership your your face sometimes is on the credit card, your names on the credit card. You've signed the credit card and debit card. They ask you to show proof of I D. Many times. Yes, you don't have to sign the credit card. By the way, is that right? Um? You if you sign it and you give somebody your credit card, you can be like you and I both know that I don't have to show you a photo I D. If my signature is on the back, if I've endorsed this credit card, that's good enough by law. Pal. But I never signed the back of my credit I put C I D in sharpie, not the letter C, the words C S E E I D. And do they do that most of the time. It's definitely picked up. Since the risk question started, I've noticed people did not do it. And now they do, and every time they do, I go, thank you for asking. Well, Plus it's ridiculous because you go to sign that stupid little thing with a ballpoint pin. It looks nothing like your signature because you're trying to squeeze it in on this little slippery, smudgy smudgy. And then the other thing, though, is signatures these days are usually I guess at a restaurant, you still sign a thing, but a lot of times now you're signing that stupid Jeopardy pad. So I don't even sign my name anymore. I just scratch something, yeah, because I mean, I can't sign my name. It looks like I'm like three years old. Yeah. My my signature is sometimes good, sometimes not. But the point is, if you sign the back of it right, somebody can practice what it looks like on the bat, make that signatures to feel like just compared to signatures. That's what it's there for. But Josh, you are protected nonetheless under the Fair Credit Building Act. If you lose your credit card, you only have to pay for up to fifty worth of the fraud. Yes, uh, if you lose or get your debit cards stolen, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act covers you same deal fifty bucks as long as you report it stolen within two days of noticing it was noticing it was gone, and then it jumps up to five bucks that you're liable for. It's not like they say, well, you gotta pay for everything and thank you big government for that. Yeah seriously, Well, I mean that's one time it works. Yeah, well there's there's another time. We'll get to it. Okay. Um, so you've got you have anonymity with cash, but you have a lack of security. Yes, you have security with plastic, both debit and credit, but you don't have any anonymity. They whoever they are, they can track your purchases. They definitely can, and they is usually law enforcement. And I guess if you if you go to the security UH aspect of it. Credit cards and debit cards, Um, well, debit cards have a leg up over credit cards because of your pen which is like it's like a signature in numbers that only you know or only you should know, and so they probably don't even ask to see your card if you use your debit card and you enter your PIN number, because they just assume that's you. You know your pin, you're not gonna steal a wallet and just get the debit card right the first time out, so they do you have it? But I have a question, and maybe someone knows this, why don't credit cards have pens? Now? I don't know that. I wonder why it would seem to be just one extra added layer. You're swiping it just like a debit card. So I don't know. I'm wondering that I have no idea, right, maybe somebody knows out there in the finance world. Uh. Cash and debit have the other advantages advantage which is a lack of fees. When you buy someone with the credit card, unless it's an American Express, which have to pay off each month, you are charged financing fees. And if you take a hit and your light on your bills, those fees are going to increase and increase to ungodly levels at times, you know percent you might be paying well. The average interest rate as of this week in the United States for credit card is fourteen that's this week. That is so much money. Um. The average debt that Americans with credit cards carry is sixteen thousand, six d and thirty five. That's not home debt. But it's not just credit card debt. The credit average credit card debt is between right now in the United States, for credit card holders, that's their credit average credit card debt. So yeah, man, if you get bumped up a few points, you're gonna feel it. And especially if you're just making minimum payments and then going out and buying more stuff and paying just a little bit off but you're adding more to it. Well, it's not very hard to do the math. You might as well put your own caller on. And if you're young and fairly naive about finance, you know what a minimum payment is. That means you're just paying the finance charges. Well you say that if you're young, But get this. I saw a stat that showed that most credit card holders were wait of credit card holders under like age thirty pay off their monthly balance, which is more than the adults. So you got to leave it to the kids. You do something right this time for once in your life. Do you know what we what kind of balance we carry zip? Really that's pretty great. We didn't used to, but we got to a point where we were looking at finance charges and we just couldn't live like that anymore. It's great. So every month you paid off. We use American Express only because we get the sky mileage you for everything we buy that you know where they don't demand that you use like a debit card, and we pay it off each month. That's great. It is. It's a good way to live because when you start looking at the finance fees that you're paying, like at the end of the year, it's depressing. Like I used to when I was single and living alone, I used to just ignore that. Well, I think that's what a lot of people doing, that's what they want. Um, you want some more stats, Yeah, I got a lot of stets too, but go ahead, okay, Um, the average American consumer, Chuck, has three point five credit cards. I don't know how you have half of credit card, but three point five credit cards. It seems like a lot to me. If you live in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Josh, of the people in that state have ten or more credit cards and those two and that nuts. That is very nuts. Alright, a kind of alright of Americans have a credit card have a debit card. That is a lot of people that have a credit card and a debit card. Okay, about people do not have a credit card? At all, and of people they have to make pay it off every month. And listen to this. The average consumer's oldest obligation is fourteen years old. So that means obligation means you've got something sitting on there from fourteen years ago. I thought they had to stop reporting after seven years. Well no, I mean if it's on your oh like credit like stuff you bought that you're still paying off. It is up to fourteen years old for the average person. Yeah, the average oldest obligation. So that trip to Europe you took in nineteen whatever, fifteen years ago, you might still be paying off. That's crazy there, consumer, And that's when I was in Europe. Actually, consumer debt December thirty one, two thousand ten, all consumer debt in America, I can almost I Alan can't say it. Eleven point four trillion dollars. That's how much America owes. That's how much the American people owe, not the government, that's how much the just the regular old Joe's though. All right, So that was that, Yeah, it was, But these are good stats. People need to know the stag Are you going with stats? Still? Uh? No, I'm done? All right, So where are we let's let's recap here. Cash is good, but you lose it easy, right, and if you lose it or its stolen it, you're almost That's what I meant to say, likely to not get it back, not that you lose it easy. Um. Debit cards are good because they offer protection from the federal government. They got a pin, you gotta pin. Credit cards offer the same protection. They don't have a pin, right. They charge fees, interest financing fees, yes, and sometimes membership fees, and debit cards now again have a higher leg up as it stands. Right. The second against credit cards because the were draft fees that used to just kill people are now illegal unless you opt in. Oh yeah, they remember there was the Card Act, so as of I think August two, you had to officially opt in with your bank to say I want overdraft protection and therefore you can charge me over draft fees. Sure, which at one point in my life I loved overdraft protection because I was right and check my butt get in cash, and I didn't mind paying those fees. Oh dude, those fees are crippling. Yeah, But if you know, if you were me in nineteen in the mid nineties, you like those fees, I got you because you could just stay afloat, and that's what it was all about for me back then. Or you could just you know, do your finances correctly true, which I did not do. Or and I remember back of America got in trouble for this. They always did. They always posted from the largest amount the smallest amount, under the idea that your smallest amount, there were more of your smallest amounts, so that when they started hitting you could get more and more overdraft fees. Right, the largest, the smallest or smallest the largest, whichever way you get hit with the more overdraft fees. That's the way that they always post. We could screen the most. Yeah, without any regard to chronology whatsoever. It was. However, however, many overdraft fees. They got in trouble for that and correct and corrected it. Yes, that's what led to this correction. That is UH debit cards are generally fee free. Your bank most likely has as a fee free debit card. Um, if you're getting cash out of the a t M at your own bank, you're probably not gonna be paying any fees there. So that's always nice to save on your fees. Unless well, that was another Bank of America thing. Remember very recently they said they were going to charge five bucks to use their debit cards five bucks a month, and Occupy Wall Street was like what and they rolled that back to they did. Apparently a bunch of other banks rolled it back except Wells Fargo still has it outstanding there they're apparently going to go ahead with their five dollar fee. So interstand another point that we should consider, Josh. If you have a problem, if you have a shopping problem, then cash is your best friend. Because there's, uh, there's a thing and they even called it the pain of paying, which is when you take cash out of your wallet or purse, pocketbook and hand it to somebody. It's a very visceral, real feeling that you see the money leave your hand and go to someone else and it's gone forever. Obviously debit and credit cards that it just exists in the ether. You may get paid electronically, you may and you could live your life without seeing a single dollar bill very easily these days, pay your bills remotely, don't have to write checks. You can do it all on the on the internet now, So that makes it pretty easy for a shopoholic to rack up some debt without realizing it or not, Yeah, without realizing it. Right, it takes away it makes money less transparent. Um like Social Security. Uh, there's no longer social Security checks. It's all electronic, which I don't think it's a scam. I think it's a money saving effort because people would move in with their old neighbor and check their mail every day, right right, you know who did that? Or just check their mail every day, not even moving. Um, there's a there's a whole there's a school of thought which is pretty rational and reasonable that there's not gonna be paper money that much longer because of stuff like that, big sweeping moves like this. Um, I don't know if about that. Well, there's paper money. Paper dollars are under assault right now. You remember the super Committee with the deficit reduction plan that their tax was coming up with. They have suggested phasing out dollar bills entirely and replacing them with dollar coins, right Okay, and um I beat down on that. Well, it would save like fivety six billion dollars over thirty years and dropping the bucket, like, what's the savings coming? Printing? So it costs more to print a dollar coin than it does to print a dollar bill, but dollar coins um average circulation life is three times longer, so ultimately it costs less over the thirty years of the dollar coins lifespan. The coin is more hardy. Yes, but you're gonna run into a company called the Crane and Co out of Massachusetts who has a friend named John Kerry who's on the super committee. And Craning Company are the ones who make the special paper four dollar bills, and they're like, no, no no, no, we can't write this. So you're always going to run into those guys. Another final um nod to to credit cards is uh, like I mentioned, I get sky miles on my m X Delta. So a lot of these programs offer rewards, whether it's towards sky miles or vacation points, hotel points, cash back. I think Discover actually write to check every year, don't they? As far as you know, still do that. And uh, you're not gonna get that with the debit card or cash, so that's important to you. Um. There was also one that I left out. I left that out of this article, but I also left out did you generally, whether you like it or not? I was wondering why you're making such fun of it. To me, You're like, I'm sitting right here, um whether you whether you like it or not, it's pretty It's a reality of this moment in history that you need a credit history of some sort to get a car or house or do any large purchase, and you can't build one with a debit card or with cash. So if you can responsibly use a credit card, uh, you can generate a credit history. And that is a huge advantage that a credit card gives you over anything else. And I also wanted to say, I think it kind of slipped by. I'm not saying that the onus is is completely on banks to not um rape and pillage. I think that the onus is on the individual consumer as well to keep your checkbook balanced and do not rely on overdraft the to you know, really take a look at where your money is going, basically to be like Chuck is now you know, actually Chuck's wife is it? This was a great article. I was just kidding around about the I don't say it now. No, it's good. Don't say no. I think you you spell out all the points very definitely. And one more time, is it non to Humi? I think you should go out and um find out for yourself, being a responsible consumer, what works best for you cash or credit. Plus, you know, it's still sometimes nice too, and it's nice to throw down the Amex gold to pay for dinner for your friends. But it's also nice to you know, have the big bank roll in your pocket and and tell your friends to go rot. Well know, you can pay in cash and look like a like a big spender. Oh yeah, I see what you're saying. You know, like if spending ok, oh yeah, you can't do that. You the cash is like if you pull that out, you're a walking target. You make it rain? You gonna if you do that kind of thing. Yeah, I can't make it rain with a credit card, you know. You know, there's throw it up in the air and it comes right back to have a bad idea either way cash, credit or debit. There here's the ending. Making it rain in any way, shape or form, with any kind of form of payment, it's a it's a bad waste of money. Only God can make your rain. Uh. If you want to learn more about um the hydrological cycle, or whether it's best play pay with cash, credit, or debit, you can type those words into the search bart how stuff works dot com and that'll bring up some good stuff. And I said, search bar. So it's time for listening round, Josh, I'm gonna call this a freaky email. Hi, guys, my mom was visiting my wife and I a few weeks ago, and they were they were both going through some old family photos in the living room. Mostly what I would over here was that's on so and so, there's great aunt, who's it? But occasionally she would mention Johnny Eck. I remember she would mention him every once in a while when I was younger, mostly in the context of some worldly advice. Johnny k would say, you should never put coffee grounds down the sink, etcetera. Anyway, they're in the living room going through these albums when my mom uh with my mom pointing at pictures naming people, and apparently she points at one and says, there's such and such and such and so and so and Johnny Ck the half Man, and all of a sudden, the needle falls off the record. My wife stopped here and they said, who whoa, whoa, whoaa, halfman? What are you talking about. My mom wasn't even face. She said, you know, Johnny Eck the half Man. So, yes, you guys know Johnny Ek. He was basically just a torso, literally half a man. My mom explained that he and his brother had lived at my grandfather's house for a while when she was a kid, helped out around his Kitty amusement park. But Jerry just fall in there. You might want to look into that grand father running the train, doing odd chores and stuff and just entertaining the kids. I had no idea if my mom had mentioned it to me before. It was so nonchalant. It never hit me until now. My wife has a bit of a morbid curiosity for morbid curiosities, so she started digging around. Turns out it didn't take much digging. He was pretty famous. He's part of the Freak show at Barnman Bailey Circus and even in the movie Freaks that we've talked about. You know Johnny K. He's he walks on his fists, that's right, And he gained a pretty big cult following with its resurgence in the eighties. And says Steve is related to Johnny K. Pretty cool related or his grandfather was friends with him. His grandfather was friends with Johnny E. Thanks a lot Steve for them. That was pretty That is very cool. What was that in relation to I believe we mentioned freaks and the show on mortgage. Really I don't remember which one it was. Well, thank you, Steve. I appreciate that. It's a pretty cool story.
