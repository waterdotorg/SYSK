Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast, room Room, etcetera. I'm Josh Clark. With me is always as Charles W Chuck Bryant. That may have been the most realistic Harley Davidson impression made by human mouth. Thanks, Room, Room, etcetera. Yeah, I was practicing that. It's good. So Chuck, how are you doing? Oh? I'm good dude. About to start the old Thanksgiving break vacation. I know this is the last thing we have to do and then a week off. But this will probably come out after thank Giving people to be like, yeah, weird, weird. Indeed, Hey, can I take you back in time? We don't have to go the way back machine. I'm just going to paint a picture for you, all right. So, a balmy Saturday night, April seventh, two two. Do you know where you were? I was living in Los Angeles, Okay, so it probably wasn't balmy for me. Okay, It's probably clear and cool, all right. Well, not too far away from where you were, in a town called Laughlin, Nevada. There is a hair Is casino and on that night a couple of guys who were there for the Lafflin River Run. It's a motorcycle uh run ride right, guy named Jeff King and Walter Boosts to two buddies, just normal guys. We're walking into the casino. The hair is at um Laughlin and this burly guy pushed past him and said that they'd better get the blank out of the way, because trouble's about to happen. Sure enough, within two minutes, King and Boost here, Uh two shots fired, and then another shot and then all holy hell breaks loose in the middle of this hair Is casino. Yet they remained after giving the warning. I take it, Yeah they did. I would have been so gone. They actually did remain because um one of them testified later on that a guy pushed past him going the other way out of the casino holding a long knife with blood all over it. So this thing, this this casino erupts into a melee. And what it happened was, uh, the Mongols, a motorcycle club. You might call him a biker gang. That's what some people might say, ran into a Hell's Angels. The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club. Yes, and again all hell broke loose of melee started. Two Hell's Angels died and one Mongol died, just like the old days. Have you seen this? Have you seen the security video of it? It's nut still you know what I did back when it happened, and they go absolutely crazy. Um, but that's kind of what happens when the Hell's Angels encounter another rival group they're not too fond of, especially the Mongols. From what I've read, apparently there aren't enemies. So we're not going to talk about the Angles today, and maybe another podcast in the works. Respect to the Mongols, we don't know within them, seriously, we're total squares. We have no affiliation whatsoever now. But we do have an article on the site here at how stuff works dot com called how the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club Works. Chuck and I kind of cooled it up by calling this podcast how the Hell's Angels Work, right, Yeah, And that's what generally most people think of them as the Hell's Angels, But that is in fact their full name. Yes, and that's what's adorned on their their jackets and such. Nicely done and by the way. Um. I think forty two Hell's Angels stood trial for that melee, and all but six head charges dropped into plea. Bargain. The government was trying to go after these guys and go after him and go after him, which we'll find out later is a real pattern, um, and couldn't get anything to stick. And I think the most any of the six guys who actually did plea, who got like thirty months something like that bad casino behavior pretty much. Yeah right, yeah, they didn't kissed the dice before you roll them. Right, So, Chuck, let's talk about the Hell's Angels, man, alright, let's do it, room, room, etcetera. The Hell's Angels, Josh, the little history they were started in the Fontana San Bernardino area of California, which, by the way, I don't know if you know this, but the Hell's Angels refer to that chapter as Burdu and Burdue was still around. Yeah, oh yeah, they still remain, although they said I think I read that most of those original Burdue members did migrate north to Oakland, which is why a lot of people think that it started in Oakland, which is faults. So burd was the first chapter who started the best we can tell, a guy named Otto Freedley. Yeah, that's that's in the late nineteen Yeah, and actually he was with another biker gang called the piste Off Bastards, and they've gotten into a war with another honest. Um, they got in a war with another biker gang. And I guess once the war was over, Freedly, I'm out. I'm gonna go start my own thing. Right, maybe that could be disappointing bastards. Um, that's uh, right after World War Two, right, these guys must have been disenchanted um servicemen who couldn't fit back into society. Miscreant pilots, right, Yeah, wasn't there like a bomber squadron called the Hell's Angels? Yeah, Josh. That is one of the most common misconceptions is that the Hell's Angels were in fact ex servicemen, outlaw pilots from World War Two, miscreants, miscreant drinkers, who were you know, didn't say answer to anybody, even in the army. Not true, because we read it on the Hell's Angel's website. Yeah, if you go into the Hell's Angels website, one guy from the Charleston, South Carolina chapter and another guy from one of the English chapters got together and did some serious, extensive research trying to find out if there was a connection between this armor group. And at no point did they say, we're not, you know, miscreating drunks. But these guys weren't. You know, it's kind of a disservice to these uh, actually really highly decorated and very successful bomber squadron servicemen. And they couldn't have operated they were miscreants and been successful if they were drunks and miscreants know, and they were highly successful. The closest they found, from what I can understand, is that a guy named are avaid arvid arvid Olsen was actually in a third pursuit group called the Hell's Angels, and he was friends with some of the founding members of the Burdoue chapter. UM, but he was never a Hell's Angel himself. And that's the closest they could find for a link between the two. They share a name, and that's it. That's it from what we can tell. Ye, So false false false false. So Chuck, we've got the founding in but the Hell's Angels, I guess kind of rode a little under the radar until nine team fifty seven, right, yes, when that Oakland Chapter was founded. Yeah, that's when they really started rolling, right thanks to a guy named sunny Barger, Yes, Ralph sunny Barger. He uh, I believe founded the Oakland UM Chapter and he wrote a bunch of books that were really successful that kind of kind of peeled back the curtain behind the Hell's Angels up front. I was reading one of them on Google Books today. It's called Hell's Angel, The Life and Times of sunny Barger, I think. And it's an autobiography because he kept using the word I and it was by him, um giveaway for an autobiography usually um. And he in his heyday was a very cool dude, it sounds like it. And also let me let me let me also, um add a caveat to that. I'm also aware that he was also a major drug trafficker who engaged in violence, um and toward women, towards squares like you and me, chuck. Um did all manner of bad things. But who's still kind of cool dude. Right. Yeah, we'll talk about that too a little bit later about the Hell's Angels in whether or not they are uh want to run a foul of the law or ride you know for charity and stuff like that. Well, what are we going to talk about now? Right now, we're gonna talk about um, let's talk about their their colors in their insignia and all that stuff. They call it their colors much like a military people call their uniform their color sometimes. And red and white are the actual colors of the letters. It's a red letters in a white field. Absolutely. And then the thing at the top top patch that actually says Hell's Angels call it the top rocker top rocker, right, and then the bottom rocker is there, um the name of the city that their chapters in right, their chapter location right. And then in the middle is what the middle is. The death head is what it's called. And that is a copy written as death Head it is, and as is their name. And that was designed by the San Francisco chapter president, Frank Satellac Sedillac. And here's an interesting fact for you. Did you know that the Hell's Angels motorcycle Club is at California Corporation. They're incorporated, and they do jealously guard their copyrighted materials, their images, all that stuff. They sued Disney for They sued Disney a couple of years ago for that movie Wild Hogs about all the middle aged bikers Martin Lawrence and Tim Tim Allen and Trivolda and William Macy. Just terrible. I'm sure I would have sued too. I can't believe you saw it. No, I didn't see it, kidding me. I saw that they sued. Yeah, so when did they sue over? These guys weren't supposed to be Hell's Angels, were they? I think so? They sued because they said they used the Hell's Angels logo and everything without their permission. I don't know if they were specifically. I don't wonder if the antagonists were Hell's Angels or something. Maybe, But all I know is they sued and I couldn't find. As usual, you can never find out what happens with the lawsuit. No, it's probably some deal. But yeah, they sued because they are, like you said, they zealously guard their name. And uh they ride Harley Davidson's but apparently are not required to do so. No, but it's all They almost exclusively ride Harley's. I can't imagine if you wheel upon a Honda that they're gonna come on in. Yeah, come on in, brother, we'll jump you in prospect um. They also apparently a typical member drives about twenty thousand miles a yearly rides, rides. We will get down, say that you drive a motorcycle. Yeah, so, Chuck, you've seen you know, we talked about the patches and and you've seen guys wearing them here. They're right. Well, yeah, there's different patches, Like if you're the president of your chapter, you'll have a little patch that like the boy Scouts sort of. Yeah, and there's all sorts. Oh man, there's all sorts of other patches and insignia. Sure that um, no one outside of the club gang whatever, uh knows the meaning of Yeah, I know the A F F A is a common one, but we do know the meaning of that because that's one of their slogans, which is uh angels Forever, Forever angels. And then you'll also see eighty one a lot of times. Eight H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and A is the first letter, So eight one J Hell's angels. Yeah, and they'll say call it like local eighty one. Sometimes it sounds for like a union. And apparently they also refer to themselves as one percenters. I heard about that too, Yeah, one percent of the outlaw bikers giving of respectable biker is a bad name. Yes, yeah, pretty cool, Yeah, it is kind of I told you so, Chuck. How do you become a member? Well, Josh, like I said, you need to own a working motorcycle. That's probably first, and have a driver's license. And have a driver's license. That's that's funny that those are rules, but it makes sense. Also, you can't ever have applied to be a police officer, prison guard. I got an a one. You cannot be a child molester. Hell's Angels don't like child molesters. They really don't. Good for them. Yeah, because you know what I don't either. The Hell's Angels have a longstanding hatred of the cops. Um and with good cause Pigs as they call him. Sure, Um Hunter Thompson are our shared hero. Wrote about the Hell's Angels and we can talk about that a little more in depth. But um he said that he was talking about how the average Hell's Angel views the establishment or the law, and he said he knows that somewhere behind the moat, the main cop has scrawled his name on a blackboard in the big briefing room with a notation beside it. Get this boy, give him no peace. He's incorrigible like an egg sucking dog. So apparently that's how Hell's Angels tend to view um the cops. Yeah, why couldn't we get Johnny Depp to have read that wouldn't have been great? Maybe we know, No, that would have been great. Uh So back to membership, if you want to be a member, takes a little while. Sometimes it can take a year or more. Yeah, to become a full patch member. As they say, so you start out as a hang around. Yeah, that's what it's just hang around them, but you're you're invited to hang around. Like, you can't just hang around and be a hang around. They'll say, what are you doing here? Uh? Square, get out of here, drive your motorcycle on out of here, or they'll hit you over the head of the tire iron right can when you drop up in your vol foe to hang around? Uh So, yeah, you're you're invited to hang around and you can attend uh some events. Evidently as a hang around, then you are made an associate if you do a good job as a hang around. How do you do a good job as a hang around? I would guess this is just a guess, But if I was a Hell's Angel, I would say that you don't cause a lot of trouble, You're fun to be around, You bring chicks to the party. Sure, that probably didn't hurt. Okay, So after the hang around you become an associate and then what you become a prospect? And this is apparently full acknowledgement that you are in the pipeline for official membership consideration. Yeah. Do you remember when we did our fight Clubs podcast and we talked about how fight clubs, especially in California, often used to like jump in prospects into gangs. These would be the people who are on their last night. Right. Did they get thrown into like a cage match with a bunch of other people and I imagine it gets pretty ugly. Yeah, no, thank you, that's what I say. Uh. And actually, if you're in a prospect at this point, you can participate in the club activities, but you cannot vote. You don't have voting privileges. Yet. That seems funny, doesn't it that they vote? It's democracy? Yeah? And Josh, what's after that? After that, my friend, you are a full patch member. Yep, you are allowed to wear the Death's Head logo. You can wear your top and lower rocker. Yeah, you get your jacket. Yeah, and um, apparently and this is this is one of those things that it may or may not be lower it could be who knows. Apparently, during initiation there is a um bucket filled with feces and urine passed around and dumped on the person. And they're never allowed to wash their colors, so that's on their on their jacket forever. Well, that's not fun. No, it's not um. And I don't think that this is correct. Apparently, our buddy Hunter T wrote that, and um, you get in trouble. He didn't get in trouble. He got away with murder. Apparently, not literally. But Sonny Barger said that that's just not true. That doesn't sound like to be right. It seems like they would not want to desecrate their colors, would be gross. Yeah, it's just a thought. Alright, I'll give us some advice if that's what you're doing, guys, not at all. You should respect your own colors. Advice for the Hell's Angels from Chuck Bryant the end. So now you are a full patch member, you're in the Alls Angels, and um, you're you're a member for life. That's why they say Angels Forever, Forever Angels. There's no retirement. No, there's not. And uh, even if you're not allowed to associate with the Hell's Angels anymore because of your terms of parole, you're still considered a Hell's Angel. Yeah. Pretty cool. Yeah, So Chuck, Um, let's talk a little more about Hunter t He literally he literally wrote the book on Hell's Angels and the mid sixties early mid sixties. He wrote an article in sixty in the Nation, and then that article got book published. A sniffing around say you should write a book on this. Sunny Barger also wrote wrote or read that article. He liked it and um he said it was a little exaggerated, but he liked Thompson's writing style. So when Thompson started hanging around some of the bars that the Burdue chapter Oakland chapter hung out at I think it was Oakland. Um. They they finally introduced him to Sunny Barger and Barger said, you know what, fine, you can hang out with us um in return for two cakes of beer, which By the way, Hunter Thompson never paid up on UM, and Hunter spent the next year hanging out with the Hell's Angels. Apparently he um helped them unload shipments of meth like planeloads of meth. Um. He helped them. He wont on a gun run with them at least once. Uh. When they got into it with the cops, he apparently jumped into his car and pulled the trunk catch down on him, and Sonny Barger said that that was it. He was like after that, I never looked at Hunter Thompson in the same way again. He figured out he was a coward, but he was also a kind of a skinny guy in a literary type. So yeah, I don't think he ever claimed to be a wise with the fisticuffs, which is why he carried guns. And then finally, this whole thing ends, his whole association ends um when Hunter gets the crap kicked out of him by the Hell's Angels, some of which he considered friends. Right, Yeah, Well, actually what I read was that he later said the ones who actually did the beating were the ones he wasn't hanging around with the most, and they were sort of on the on the fringe there. You know what happened, well, I I couldn't find I heard they he made a remark at a party he did, and I couldn't figure out. I couldn't find what that remark was. Hell's Angel by the name of Junkie George had his dog. No, this is not Hippie robb Um, although I could see Hippie rob knowing Chunkie George. Um. Anyway, Junkie George had his dog with him, and his dog bit him, and Junkie George kicked his dog, and Hunter Thompson walked up to him and said, only punk slapped their old ladies and kicked their dogs. And Junkie George did not like that one bit that started ye, so he um he put the smack down on Hunter Thompson. A bunch of other guys jumped in, and Hunter Thompson drove himself to the police station. The police turned him away and he drove himself to the hospital. He was treated and he never hung out with the Hell's Angels again. That was in but he did publish the book Hell's Angels, The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs and apparently a lot of it was exaggerated. But this is where Sonny Barger said he wrote the book for law enforcement, Like law enforcement all read it and they're like, oh, well, sure, this is what we're dealing with. And a lot of it was. Well, gang rape was in there, and I don't know if that was exaggerated or not. He said he witnessed gang rape on more than one occasion and that they used it as a form of punishment. And uh. He said that they admitted that it was a form of punishment that Hell's Angels did, so I will say allegedly here, but it was in the book. Thompson apparently also lent his notes to another journalist at least equally good, by the name of Tom Wolf. Yes, of the of the Right Stuff fame, as well as the electric Koliate asseid tests. Yes. Um, the Hell's Angels factor hugely in the electric koal Aid asset test, which is actually about the Mary pranksters. And uh, I think in nineteen sixty five, the Hell's Angels went to the Lee, Oakland border and beat the tar out of some lefty anti war protesters. College students beat him up and then vowed to break up any anti war demonstration they ever came across um So Hunter. Apparently it took um Alan Ginsburg the poet and Ken Kizi, the leader of the Mary Pranksters, and introduced him to Sonny Barger, then went off his own way. And uh, that meeting kind of made peace between the hippies and the Hell's Angels famously. Yeah, and I think Ginsberg even wrote a poem about the Hell's Angels. Yeah, yeah, I couldn't find it though, Okay, but I would like to see you didn't dream that. Yeah, man, it was a beautiful poem. Now he really did write a poem though, Okay, it's funny thing about Alan Ginsberg hanging out with the Hell's Angels. It's really weird, especially like the head Hell's Angel. Yeah, yeah, but yeah, Sonny Barger said that he loved acid and it was the one thing he his people in the hippies had in common, are one of the main things. And they did plenty of the acid tests that La Honda and Stid all sorts of crazy stuff with the prankster. Yeah. Those are the days. Huh, those were the days. And actually, let me say another thing about law enforcement. Apparently, when Hunter Thompson was hanging out with the Hell's Angels there, um their their influence and their membership was drastically on the wing. And then a guy named Thomas Lynch, who was the Attorney General for California at the time, he issues a report on the Hell's Angels and it is ridiculous and bloated and exaggerated, and but apparently it just blew up the Hell's Angel street cred and all of a sudden they were just their members. They have more members than ever after that report. Yeah, so sometimes it works against you when you try and quash something. So I guess we should talk about some of the good they do and some of the bad they've done, because there's the fight an opinion the Hell's Angels. Uh, they raised money for charity. They're famous for their uh their work with the Toys for Tots and they do charity rides and stuff like that over the years, and I think they've cleaned up their act a lot, probably now compared to what it was like in the sixties. But they've had some scrapes with the law many many times along the way, uh, notably at Altamont Speedway that was a big one. Yeah, we can't talk about the Hell's Angels without talking about this. This was the ultimont free concert and it was famously recorded in the concert film Gimme Shelter. It was apparently the day the sixties died? Is that what they say? Is that that what that stupid song is about from that guy American Pie. Yeah, he's not talking about that now, that's about the death of Buddy Holly. That's the day the music died. Either him. I hate that song. Anyone who can listen, sit still, sit down and listen to that song all the way through, right in. And I've got a prize for you. You're a special person. I forget to send you information the Hell's Angels. So back to altamont Um. It was a free concert there and a bunch of bands played, Jefferson Airplane and the Rolling Stones. The Dead was supposed to play. They helicoptered in and then by that time things had gone south. Well, yeah, they the Stones helicoptered into and what happened was the Stones hired the Hell's Angels. Although there's been back and forth over the years that whether or not they were hired for the show by the organizers or whether the Stones specifically hired them as their personal security, and it's a he he said, she said type of deal with the Stones saying we did not hire them specifically, and the Hell's Angel saying, yes you did. You said you'd give us five with a beer if you we would, we would be your bodyguards. So they show up. They parked their bikes between the audience and the stage. Stones go on and actually before this happened that the violence had been escalating at this at this show free show in the sixties at Altamont, it was not good. There were I think two or three deaths and numerous fights and beatings breaking out, and one of the Hell's Angels smacked down Marty Balan of Jefferson Airplane knocked him unconscious. The Grateful Dead see this and they're like, we are out of here. This is not our scene and we're not gonna play and we're leaving, and they got back on their little helicopter and left. Have you seen that footage? And uh, yeah, give me shelter is great. If if you guys haven't seen that, you should definitely watch it. Um. So back to the Stones. Stones take stage, things start to devolve into violence and a guy named Meredith Hunter pulls a gun, points it at the stage and you can see all this in the film, and he gets jumped and stabbed to death by Alan Pizzaro, a Hell's Angel, famously, and the concert stopped. And you know, the Stones had a pretty awful time with the pr obviously about this. And apparently the Hell's Angels um were exposed for plotting to kill Mick Jagger for criticizing them after that. Yeah, true, and uh Pissarrow actually got off Scott Free Equitt. Yeah, because the film clearly showed that that that guy had a gun and he did pull it, and so he was the aiming it. They don't know. They said it was towards the stage, and um, you can't really tell from the footage from what I remember, but um, you know, the reports were that he was going to kill the Rolling Stones, which I didn't know that that was gonna happen by then. So the Hell's Angels already had a pretty rough reputation. This is this just cements it, right, So they just kind of go balls out. Um, which is a motorcycle term and not a vulgar expression. By the way. We learned that um and uh by throughout the seventies, they own the market on meth amphetam means yeah, apparently just the burd dude chapter alone. This is a law enforcement estimate from nineteen seventy nine, right after they staged a raid on that chapter's clubhouse, where Sunny Barger was right um that this this chapter alone controlled five meth labs that could make a hundred and sixty thousand dollars or the pills a day. Wow, and this is nine man. Yeah, yeah, that's crazy. So they don't call it like biker speed for nothing. It was because the bikers, specifically the Hell's Angels, cornered the market meth am fed amine in the seventies. They're also they also sold, allegedly sold cocaine, heroin, pretty much anything. Sure, prostitution was a big one apparently. And over the years they've been um indicted and accused and booked for everything from rape to to murder. Sonny Barger himself was in federal prison for four years for conspiring to blow up a rival gangs clubhouse. I don't know what the gang was, probably the Mongols is my guess. And so yeah, they've run a foul the law quite a bit over the years, they definitely do. But if you'll notice Sonny Barger got four years in federal pent right, you never hear about a Hell's Angel being put by God. You would hear about it if it happened. Yeah, I would imagine you would never hear about them getting life imprisonment. So you start to give the impression after everything you hear about the Hell's Angels, but then these pittily convictions that are slapped against them that maybe they are right in thinking that law enforcement and the establishment has it out for him. I think they definitely have it out for him, and they probably have participated in illegal activities throughout the years. But it's a big organization, and like you said, if there's you know, a small handful of of actual convictions compared to their vast history, that's, you know, that's not too bad because it's not saying they're great guys or anything, but it's not like they've been run up on, like you said, murder charges like all over the place. Although last this week they were in the news the the Vegas cops rated six Hell's Angels locations in Las Vegas and they seized records and knives and evidence, because last year there was a brawl once again between the Mongols and Hell's Angels, and I think two people were stabbed. Allow me to interrupt if we have anything to impart in this podcast, it's if you ever find yourself in the same room, the same building, the same parking lot, same town as a bunch of Mongols and a bunch of Hell's Angels, get out. Do you know what happened in Vegas? Oh, it's actually kind of funny. Huh. Two people were stabs, so it's not funny. But that was at a They both show up at a they were double booked at a wedding chapel, a Mongol wedding. Oh yeah, a Hell's Angel's wedding. We're both booked at the same wedding chapel at the same time. Not good, No, And I'm sure the person who booked that didn't wasn't brought up on charges or anything. And in fact, they're probably the ones that originally are to blame. They sat back and went exactly right. So, Chuck, what started out in Burdou and then blew up in Oakland has grown into like a worldwide organization. Whether or not it's an outlaw, biker gang or whatever. Um, they have a legitimate chapters in how many countries? Twenty nine countries? How many chapters? Want more than a hundred? Yeah, in all sorts of places too. I think in nineteen eighty four they had their first South American chapter open in Rio. Now they have them in Um, Greece, Russia, Czech Republic, Wales, Luxembourg, Luxembourg, the Luxemburghs Angels. Yeah, and that's money to me. Apparently the ones in Europe are going nuts these days. There's a huge turf woar that's been ongoing in Scandinavia. Australia is having real problems with them too. Um. And there's things like, you know, rocket launchers showing up, grenades being used like in these gang wars. Yeah, that's not in the like the old days with knives and fists. Rocket launcher Yeah, yeah, that's a different deal. I told Joe Square. The first chapter outside the US web was in New Zealand in ninette. And little known fact, George Harrison of the Beatles God Rest his Soul is allegedly responsible for bringing the Hell's Angels to England. Yeah. He invited a couple vide a couple of dudes that he met in San Francisco viting them over in England. They come over and hang out and boom, a London Hell's Angels chapter pops up afterwards. Pretty cool or is it? I don't know. And right now Poland and Iceland are currently seeking chapter. So good luck to Iceland, that's what I say, Poland, Yes, alright, good luck with that. So that's the Hell's Angels. I'm quite sure that there's a lot, a lot, you could even say a hell of a lot more information out there that will never find out because again, Chuck and I are squares who will never get to hang out with the Hell's angel ever, mainly because we don't want to get beat up. Yeah. I'm not a big fan of throwing punches or taking them on the chin. It's just not me. I'm a fan of running away. Um, if you want to learn a little more about The Hell's Angels, you can take that into the handy search bar at how stuff works dot com. Uh. You might also want to you go onto the Hell's Angels Motor Club website. It's pretty interesting. It's got links to other chapters two and also congratulations uh to the Burdue chapter on their sixtieth anniversary, which and um, since I said the Burdu chapter, I guess that means it's time for listener mate. Yes, indeed, Josh, I have a couple of corrections here for a change that we're going to acknowledge. Well, we haven't read corrections in a while. First of all, if I want to say that Bernie Gets, Bernard Gets is not a serial killer, I mistakenly said that and pre killer right. He didn't kill anyone. He shot some guys in New York and no one died, and he was not even convicted of attempted murder or anything. And he's still alive and living in New York. And I feel like a big jerk because I got him confused with Charles Bronson and death Witch. I was dead wrong, and I'm man enough to admit it. I'm sorry Bernard Gets, you didn't. You're not a real killer, obviously, so I apologize for that. We had angry people right in about that dude. That one lady man, it's like Bernie Gets his sister or something. I think she was she was scared. But I do feel bad because that's not right. Uh. We have a quick correction. Remember the toling Get Indians that we were trying to pronounce. Apparently it's pronounced clinkett. And we had people right in from Alaska. Matthew actually Matthews from Seattle, Washington. He wrote in and says it's pronounced clink clink up. So there he had that. Thanks, And then finally we have another correction. I remember when I said about the Amish not being able to listen to us rooms spring up and that if they actually wrote in they would be liars. I'm not true because of what rum. Yes, we had a farmer, John of New York right in and said that we had a few people write in on this. The Amish, every Amish teenager, nearly every homist teenager goes on rum spring out where they effectively leave the community and live with us regular English folks, Americans for a period of time, and they are free to indulge in the things that American kids indulge in, drugs, drinking, smoking, whatever if they want. And podcast podcast listening is is definitely one. So evidently we could very well have been heard by an Amish person. Here's my argument to that. Okay, so they go on rump springing to decide whether they want to live with the English or stay in Amish. Sure during this period, in my opinion, they're in some sort of middle ground between the two, so they're technically not Amish. So if one of them on rum spring I heard this, send it in and be like, dude, you haven't made your decision yet, I don't want to hear it from me. Or what if they heard our podcast and we're so taken with it they refused to go back to the Amish lifestyle, or if they heard it and hated it so much they went screaming back to Mom and Paul sportily. So thank you. Farmer John in New York, he says, ps, I'm not Amish, but I'm a lowly cal farmer. Although rum spring it would be pretty sweet, that's what he says. Yeah, So I encourage John just go on his own room springing. I went on my own room springing. I'm still online.
