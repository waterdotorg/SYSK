Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. Don Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and it's the stuff you should know. Jerry's over there fiddling and fuxing around Halloween and June. Right, remember when we had the horror fiction contest last year? Actually this maybe July? Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, and we I think that the the deadline for submissions was in July. It was weird to be in that kind of hallowing mindset while it was hot out. But yeah, and I'm sure it was weird to ask the authors are not to ask, but to have them get in that mindset to write something creepy. We definitely didn't command you talked me out of that. Yeah. That was a good contest. Yeah, also known as the Contest that Will Shall Never Happen again. Well, we also ended up with the one that we're going to read this year, right, I think, yeah, yeah, that's a good one. It is a good one. Uh, you guys will have to see in a few months what we're talking about's right, So, Chuck, Um, I myself have never officially seen a ghost, but I understand you have a ghost story. I do. I remarked about it and I said, I'm gonna wait till we do our ghost podcast. Well here we are. Pal is this it? Should I go? Now? Yeah? Okay, I'm not saying this is a ghost. What I'm saying is one night I saw something very very very strange that I cannot explain. Okay, okay, are you ready? I feel like should have music or something Jerry that could probably be done. Um So Athens Georgia College, I would say, I don't remember the exact year, but it was probably my best friend and I Brett had had gone out and um, we're going back home, uh, and driving through five points, you know the area. So we're coming from like let's say the direction of campus, and you know there's a cut through if you take a certain road and five points that cuts you over to Alps Road and people are gonna be like, what is he talking about? I just I'm talking to you here. Uh. And so there's this one area where you go around a road curves ninety degrees and then about i'd say two hundred feet after that there's a four way stop sign. It's very NEIGHBORHOODI area. I think that's like where Ray Golf used to live. He Vince Duley lives over there. That might be what you're thinking. So we go around this ninety degree curve and I'm looking, you know, I'm filling with the radio or something, and my buddy Brett starts, uh like kind of joke, screaming like, oh what is that? But getting around and I look up and in the middle of the intersection and I swear, people, I'm not making this up and I did not hallucinate it. This is God's honest truth. There was a what looked like a hundred year old woman wearing a black robe with a purple sash dagonal across her chest, and she was standing in the middle of the intersection holding a Bible like this kind of on her placed on her fingertips as you would hold like like a waiter would hold a platter about chess level, and she was sort of looking in the other direction with kind of a vacant look on her face like you have now or is it just she was completely vacant, completely still didn't move an inch and wasn't like an hazy apparition, I mean, was solid and looked real, real, real dude, it's so freaky. We pull right up on her to you know, take that left, and we're both kind of jokes screaming, but then as we get closer, we're like, you know, what's going on here? But it all happened in like, oh, fifteen seconds, so it wasn't a lot of time to register, you know, what is this. We were just sort of getting around and we pull right by her and take a left, like, you know, if this is her. We pull within feet of her, and she's on my side at this point because we're turning right by her. She doesn't blink, doesn't move a muscle, and we were one probably an hour in this curve. He starts like he can't drive a stick shift anymore because he's freaking out the cars, like jerking and sputtering. He pulls over probably fifty ft later. We both turned around out the back window and there's nothing there. I'm getting looked chill bumps uh, And to this day I have no idea what the heck it was. And it was either a crazy, crazy old woman who is really fast, which is really creepy and really fast, or the most believable Madame Tusso's wax dummy, I've ever seen someone ran and set out there and we didn't see it, and then ran and took it away. I'm not offering any explanation, not saying it was a ghost, but I have no recollect or explanation for what it could have been. And it was creepiest, weirdest thing I've ever seen. And we both described it to each other immediately, like what did you see? What did you see? Had gold leafing? I mean, I can't say it was a Bible because I didn't see the cover, but it, you know, that gold leafing around it look like a bible. So you both saw the same thing, exact same thing, purple sash, black robe, silver hair. That is one of the pernicious qualities of a ghost sighting is that frequently people will see the same thing. Two different people will see the same thing, which lends a tremendous amount of credence to something because if one person just sees it, well, it's a hallucination. Exactly you were clearly on something we were not. But that's what somebody could say. Both of you saw it. Even if you both were on something, that doesn't mean you're going to see the exact same thing. Yeah, And I wasn't like some big ghost guy. I'd never have had looked for them or say, oh I believe in ghosts that would just out of nowhere of boom, there had happened, right exactly. Um. You can also go a little further if you're a skeptic and say, well, I mean Chuck and Brett Brett just kind of we're playing off on another description and they came to some unconsciously came to an agreement of this. You guys compiled the story and you saw the same thing. Who knows that however you approach that probably depends on whether you're part of the or percent of Americans who don't believe in ghosts or who do believe in ghosts. According to a two thousand nine CBS News poll, I had never given it much thought, but after that I was I was definitely like, well, that was a ghost and I just saw one. Yeah, And I researched a little bit, but this was long ago before the Internet was born, and so I couldn't find anything. And even look yesterday just to see if I could find out anything, if there was some sightings or some old lady that have been killed or anything and nothing. Now, I couldn't find anything. So that was just your own personal ghost maybe, or just some creepy old woman who was still in not blinking as a car barrel towards her. Either way, that is very unsettling either way. Um, And that's a pretty good ghost story. It was a good one. It was not a mask, you know, I can say that for sure. Like we pulled up within feet of her, Like I looked in her face and she and she didn't move a must didn't move a muscle man. That's it was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me. And we told that story many many times over the years, and everyone's always like really, and I always say, I swear, why would I make this up? So that's my ghost story. That's a good ghost story. You can reach us on Facebook. Right, it's time for message break. All right? Wait, wait, Jerry, it's not really kind for message break. What she left pretty quick. So we're talking ghosts. And like I said, of Americans believe in ghosts, don't. Yeah, And I think a lot of people, especially after reading this, there's the whole you know, I really miss my deceased relative and I go to seances, and I think those things the mind can play tricks on you. But in my case, it was just like those are the ones where I'm like, what's going on here? You know, Well, it's pretty much impossible to disprove something or to prove something doesn't exist, right, which is one reason why belief in ghosts continues on. But there's also a lot of, um, there's also a lot of factors in ghosts that accumulated create this body of you know, ghost belief, what our ghost ghostly sightings, hauntings, apparations, all that stuff that um kind of over time have taken on a life of their own or I should say, have been around for thousands and thousands of years, um, and have not been dispelled by science. Um. So we're going to kind of approach this from like, you know, here's what people believe ghosts are, and here's some scientific explanations for it. But throughout this you will notice that at no point are we ever going to say conclusively science has proven that ghosts don't exist, because it kind of can't. That's not to say that people aren't using the scientific method to study ghosts, because some are, and my hat is off to these people most of all. So let's up ghosts man. All right, Well, I just described my encounter, which, like I said, wasn't hazy or weird. Um, well it's weird. It wasn't like a hazy apparition. But many times as an apparition. Um, Sometimes it's lights, it seems to hit every since. Sometimes it's a smell um like Tracy pointed out in this article, like the smell of deceased relative's favorite meal being cooked in the other room, stuff like that, Or the smell of the deceased relative just smelled something like rotting, but it was just a scuirrel in the wall. Can be a song, can be flickering lights, can be orbs in a picture. We'll talk about that, or a ghost in a picture. Like there's plenty of those. Hey, I got you got a Google. It's pretty fun to look at those. Yeah, and there's some that are like this one's not quite explained to my full satisfaction. Yeah, some of the If you look up famous ghost pictures, there's a handful that have made the rounds over the years that are pretty good, like the Lady of Brown on Hall. I believe is that the girl with the fire no that's a good one. That's a real good one. Um, there's a woman descending a staircase like a ghostly woman. Um. Freddie Jackson the World War two, World War One pilot killed or mechanic. I'm sorry he was killed, and then he showed up in a group photo two days later. Um. That one was explained as a double exposure, which I mean, just the coincidence behind it is in and of itself staggering if that is the explanation for of course, it also could be a hoax. But it's a pretty good on. Freddie Jackson is my favorite one. I think my favorite is the Old West. Did you see that one? It's like boothill or something. It was in I think, and this guy dressed up like a cowboy and you know, had his picture made but with his friend. And then in the back ground you see this guy. Yeah, I did, like kind of peeking up maybe behind a tombstone. Yeah, um, just in the brush. Yeah. And supposedly they say are verified by photo experts and stuff is having been untouched. So yeah, because photoshop is making it way easier to screw with photography, but it's also fairly easy to detect too. If you really dig into the individual pixels, you can say, well, this is obviously, and especially these old photos when they're examining negatives, it's not that those weren't photoshops, right, I mean, it could be light playing tricks. But when you see a girl standing by the rail of you know, with the fire behind her, that one was explained as the girl in the fire. Yeah, that one was explained as a just a sheer chance mixture of smoke and light. And then our um programming, like us being hardwired to pick faces out of anything. I don't know, man, this looked pretty much like it definitely does then it yeah, um. And then of course there's the funny things like the three men and a baby ghost cut out of that dancing or the Wizard of Oz like Hanging Munchkin, which was, although I have to say, since you bring it up, one of the greatest short you know, I love short horror fiction. Of course they were one of the greatest um ones I've ever read. Was called The Hanging Man of Oz. It's like, um, it was. It's only just a few years old, but it's a good little short story. Really. Yeah. Yeah, this guy who like gets kind of caught up in like looking for it. It's good, yeah, good horror fiction. Um, this doesn't have to do with ghosts. But supposedly there's a murder captured on Google Earth. Have you seen that making the rounds. It's an aerial shot obviously of a dock somewhere in Europe, I think, by the water, and it looks like a guys like dragging a dead body in a big pool of blood towards the water. But they, I think they've debunked that it was a dog who had shaken off and gotten the ground wet, and people verified later like yeah, that was me and my dog, and yeah, stop asking questions because my dog, someone posted on our Facebook call. But I mean you bring up a that's that's a really good like you see what you want exactly. Um. But again we say, you can't really prove that ghost don't exists. So people are like, prove it. It doesn't prove anything, you know. Um, if you can prove that a photograph has been faked, then you've proven it's been faked. But you can't just look in and be like, oh, I'm sure it's a fake that doesn't muster. Yeah, so they we we've covered photos they show up in photos. Well why are they here? I mean there's a lot of explanations, like they're delivering bad news or good news, right. Yeah. There's a lot of ghost stories where, um, the dead have suddenly appeared to a relative on the other side of the planet at the moment they died. Like the relative wakes up the next day to find out that the person died at twelve fifty nine am when they just saw them sitting in their room at the same time. So sometimes they're they're coming to say, hey, I love you, see you in fifteen years um. Or they're coming to say you're about to die, that's another long standing legend. Yeah, or they're about to say like, um, it's it's a should sell your Yahoo stock now, that'd be a good ghost right. Um. You know, there's a lot of stuff you can you can say that people have attributed to ghosts and why they're here. Um, there's also that horrible um experience as their last moments. Yeah, they they are at the point where they died too young or uh, maybe have just gone back to their favorite place in life. Um. Earthbound spirits, I think is what paranormal investigators call those situations. Like they're stuck here or it's like, you know, get off my train type of situation. They're guarding a place. Maybe there's not one, but to um ghost two women at the Hotel del del Coronado and San Diego, very famous late nineteenth century built hotels. UM, and both of them took their own lives at the hotel when they found out they were pregnant out of wedlock. Or one was married but her husband and left her, and so they're in two different rooms still. But that's an example of a ghost being tied to a place. Yeah, and UM we have an article on the site about haunted hotels. That a lot of hotels and all around the world, but especially in places like New Orleans and um like old spooky Spanish. I guess the Coronado is probably one of those. There's one, and I believe Colorado or the one they used for the overlooking No. Um. It's it's just like a plain o like regular cool hotel, but it has like a stream running through the lobby. Yeah, which is cool in and of itself. And I don't remember where I saw this, but um, it was like on some TV show or this it's like a super Haunted Hotel supposedly the ghost waiter is it. I don't I don't remember, I don't wait for the river. Yeah he had his pants rolled up and yeah the caviary pop is awesome. Uh, that was the best th of muster right then, I'm sorry. Um. And you know, there are mediums out there who uh you know, if you saw the movie Ghost Whoopy Goldberg. Obviously there's many times hucksters trying to take advantage of people saying they can contact people, put you in touch with your relatives that have passed. Um, but I'm sure they're very There are a lot of mediums who really believe what they're doing is for real, you know. Yeah, And what's what's kind of ironic is um, there's this really great article, it's just a little quick editorial actually from the Los Angeles Times in two thousand and six, is called is Science Afraid of Ghosts? Is written by Deborah bloom right, and she basically points out that like we we used to have psychical research societies like William James, effectively the founder of psychology, like investigated the paranormal as well and conducted like extensive real scientific experiments and along the way debunked a lot of mediums, like the nineteenth century, the Victorian era. UM. And so part of this investigation into the paranormal um was not just it wasn't just to prove that ghosts existed. It was just to understand the paranormal in its own terms. And along the way, say this person is a fraud, this person is a huckster. This ectoplasm is cheesecloth that they had like stuffed in their cheek, you know. Um, And and that was part of it. And over time, I think science has just kind of thrown out the whole thing, the baby with the bathwater, and now it's just up to uh, kind of the more mean spirited section of the skeptical world to just go after and debunk. There's nobody looking for their very you people looking to prove or disprove the existence of ghosts. It's more just like this photograph was faked, right, you know what I mean? Yeah? Um, And on photographs, I guess we should talk about orbs um very famously. Orbs show up in pictures and uh, some people, you know say that that is a very um specific part of the journey of the ghost is when they are an orb. I have an ORB picture which I'll post on Facebook. Emily believes it is her grandfather. We he had just passed away, and the photograph he was the biggest dog lover I've ever known. And uh, we had just finished our fencing in our backyard and our house that we bought, so it had been like six or eight months that our dogs couldn't go back there. So we finally let them back there, and I had a camera, was like, I gotta take pictures to this, and they start playing around like crazy, and in one of the pictures there's an ORB boom right there above the dogs playing in Emily, it's like, that's Charlie, that's my grandfather. He's coming to visit. So I didn't debunk that. But supposedly skeptics will say that could be a camera flash reflecting off thus particles I use, no flash, water spots on the camera lens, bone dry uh defects, and digital camera sensors. I guess it could be that although it was a new camera and it's never done that sense or printing errors. It was not printed or developed, so who knows. I'm just saying I've got a great ORB photo that I'll post my dog's playing. You raise a really good question, and like, I mean, what's the what's the value of debunking that? I don't know? Photo it made him only feel nice? It still does why, I mean, what is the value? I mean? I guess we'll cover it later. Yeah, but there's this uh yeah, that that question keeps coming up to me throughout the researching this. It's like it's not hurting anybody, right, um so chuck, Uh, I guess a really good question. If we're gonna talk about how ghost work is, what would ghosts be made of? Like we said, the Victorians believe that they were made of ectoplasm. Today, if you talk to a someone who believes in ghosts and like researchers ghosts and like that's part of their world, they prevailing idea is that they're made of energy of somehow I can't remember which. A lot of thermodynamics state that energy cannot be created or destroyed, just transfers states. That would be a pretty good understanding of what ghosts are if they are real. So a life force that had passed from a live person is now a different kind of energy exactly, um medichlorians, what is that? This is the Star Wars. That is how they explained the force. Who are the medic Chlorians? I don't remember. It was very disappointing, though it sounds really familiar, was it from the newer three? Yeah? Yeah, that was how they explained. Basically, they explained what the force was, and everyone's like, oh, why don't you go and do that? I got you, I remember that now. Um. Other theories are that um, if they are some sort of energy, they could also be some form of matter. So maybe they're made of some sort of quantum particles or an arrangement of quantum particles, which I find kind of an interesting explanation because think about it, ghosts can are They're frequently said to be able to travel through solid matter. Right. Well, if you go down to the quantum level and you start looking at transistors, there's a big problem in early transistor development and that individual electrons can pass right through the wall of a transistor. It's called quantum tunneling, and um, they had to figure out how to use crystals to kind of block electrons in to make them flow the way you wanted, rather than just be like, oh, I'm over here now. So some people say, well, maybe these are some sort of quantum particles or an arrangement of quantum particles that were able to perceive somehow. And then the question I would have is is there a consistent explanation on why some people might become a ghost and some others not? And the answer is no, or are they everywhere and some you just have a stronger energy force or something? Who knows? Yeah? Because I mean if if people tend to perceive ghosts more than others, and that typically from studies, has been shown to be people who believe in ghosts tend to see them more often report hauntings, Um, why wouldn't they see them all the time? Yeah, Like why wouldn't so? Yeah, that would indicate that there is something about an individual person that would make them become a ghost. So many questions. Well, the whole unfinished business like it died to a young thing. I can wrap my head around that, Like an energy force that was so strong that has now gone still could be around. Um, I'm trying to decide what part I'd lie in. Do I believe in ghosts? I think so. So There's a dude named Richard Wiseman of a University of Hertfordshire and He's done a lot of research in gb Great Britain, and he has found some pretty consistent results that people have generally reported the same things in the same places, even if they didn't know there was any ghost activity there, even if they did or didn't believe. Actually, if they did believe, they were more, like you said, more apt to see a ghost. But he had consistent results of specific places. Yeah, I mean like he applied the scientific method to researching ghosts, and he he documented what, what parts, what areas in a reportedly haunted place sightings were most frequently reported. Basically found that like you could, you could map out areas where sightings were Okay, so that's step one, and then step two. We had people who who encountered ghosts described their experiences, and he kind of compiled the data. Then he went back to see what other commonalities there were for an area, like physical conditions there, like how cold is it, is it humid? Um Let me measure the light, let me measure the magnetic field. Right. What he found, though, interestingly, was that um there were specific areas where people who had no understanding of the history of the place they were seeing or had heard that the area was haunted had reported seeing something. So there was something to a specific area being quote haunted, and people who didn't necessarily believe in ghosts or didn't know that the place was supposed to be haunted had reported not only that they had seen a sighting or something in this building, but in the specific area of this building. Yeah, what does that mean? It's a consistent study, right, So, and Wiseman is a part of this kind of long but very um small, smally sparsely populated um tradition of like paranormal researchers, like legitimate ones. I could get into that. Man. When I was a kid, I used to want to go to Duke and study paranormal or para psychology there. Yeah, they had a para psychology department. It was led by a guy named Joseph Ryan, who was another like legitimate para psychological researcher. Um. You could have gotten a TV show on the Science Change, Yeah, totally. U c l A used to have one from I think now they shut it down and I think the mid eighties, but it was around from like the fifties or sixties up to the eighties and it was well respected. Um. William James was another researcher. Uh as of the nineties, James Huron and Renny Lange are still doing research and writing books. Um, Harry Price was a very famous one. Yeah, he was famous for investigating really Rectory, which was supposed to be like the most haunted place in England. And then now, if you want to get a degree in paras psychology, you can go to the American University or you can go to University of Edinburgh. Those are the two places, as far as I know, in the Western world where you can get a paras psychology degree. I could see that the Great Britain's has a lot of um, ghostly activity and paranormal investigators and they're into it over there. And Edinburgh is supposed to be the most haunted city in all of Europe. Really a bunch of dissatisfied Scotsman roaming the bog right. Um, so we've kind of laid it out right. Yeah, I feel like we've laid it out like we've got them. We all understand what ghosts. I don't think we really said anything that people are like, oh yeah, I didn't realize that's what a ghost is. Um. What I found interesting is that there's some really good explanations for ghostly activity. Yeah, Sometimes Stracy points out, I mean there are so many explanations. There's such a wide range from this person just hallucinated something, right, and I want to stay with that. Specifically, we're starting to understand that hallucinations are way more common than anybody has admitted for a very long time because we are afraid of being put away or label is crazy. But people hallucinate more than we generally understand they do. And specifically, grief is supposed to be able to trigger hallucinations pretty really, which would explain visitation dead relatives shortly after they die. Um. We've talked about sleep paralysis before. That's an explanation that you hear a lot about someone laying in bed. They can't move and they are hallucinating um, spirits and things. Right, they think they're awake, but they're not. Yeah, and you're incapable of moving. There's also the hypnogogic trance, which comes at the onset of sleep, and it's a sort of trance that supposedly you can hallucinate. Yeah, I've had that happened before, like a my wake, am I sleep that it is here? Something? Oh? Yeah, yeah, sure, you know. Um. And then sometimes it's just you know, the window shut itself because it was loose in the wind blew it, or the door shut because there was a draft where it's cold in here, because you know there's a draft. You know, a lot of times there's just literally an explanation, a physical explanation for what happened. So, um, you you hit upon. One of the hallmarks of haunting activity is a change in temperature and unexplained change in temperature and a haunted room when a ghost is present. And like you said, it's often like a chimney or a drafty window or something like that. But people who investigate this kind of thing also often explain that phenomenon by um, a lack of humidity, right, lower humidity can make a room feel colder. And what about an area of a room? Though I don't know, I mean, I I like, that's that's a really good question, dude. How can an area of a room be number one colder if if there isn't a draft, if it's not a draft, it's just like a static area in a room that's cold. Um, if there's just a decrease in humidity, what causes the decrease in humidity that makes it feel colder. And they have found that um areas that are supposedly haunted. Well, I should say, Richard Wiseman found in one place that was supposedly haunted, UM, it tended to be less humid than other areas, So that would explain the cold chill. But how is one area just a part of a room less humid than another. Yeah, and I'm curious about what kind of temperature drop people have seen, um, like how drastic it's been. I couldn't find any like reputable information on that. Like in the movies, you walk into the corner and you can see your breath all of a sudden and you're freezing. Yeah, like the sixth sense, right, Yeah, yeah, that poor kid. Um. But also I wonder then if it's not even necessarily a real change in temperature, although supposedly ghost hunters can measure changes in temperature in a room and that means the ghost is present, Or if it's just the sensation of a chill running through your body and it's not actually thermal, it's psychological. Yeah, your your central nervous system. Yeah, I just got chill bumps earlier. You know, you did what about the electrical fields? That's um, A very common thing is for a paranormal investigator to measure magnetic field and electrical fields in an area. Um, they will say that this is kind of proof that there's some sort of presence there because the you know, the Ghostbusters E meter is going crazy? Right exactly what do they call that? I can't believe. I can't remember that. I can't remember it either, the one that that Egan held up to. Uh yeah, yeah, I don't remember what it's called. We're going to get in trouble for that. Yeah, sorry guys. Um, But sometimes, um, these fields can cause wacky things happening with the brain, can cause hallucinations, can cause dizziness or other neurological symptoms. And they're saying that might play into it, the fact that you think you have seen a ghost right there, they're saying. Investigators are saying, yeah, there actually is something different here with the the area's electrical field, electro magnetic field. There's something going on here. But it's possible that that's what's making you think there's a ghost here, rather than there's a ghost here and it's affecting the field, it's hitting your angular gyrus. Right, that's a part of the brain that UM. Evidently, if it's stimulated you can get the sense that someone is behind you mimicking your movements, which is pretty creepy. I mean, we're we're all familiar with the transcranial magnetic stimulation the thinking cap. That's a cool episode. UM. And when you apply a magnetic pulse to different parts of the brain, different things happen, and one of them is definitely hallucinations. And then another example of UM magnetic field messing with us, I guess is that a lot of haunting activity is reported at night, supposedly UM, right exactly. That's that's number one. But number two. The magnetosphere, you know, the the the part of the Earth's atmosphere that protects us from the charged ions of solar wind, the way that the Earth is arranged to the Sun, the part that's in darkness. UM has a larger part of the magnetosphere surrounding it, more warped towards that. So that might explain it then, right, so it looks like a spider, it does. But there's a lot more UM magnetic field activity going on in the darker side of Earth. So at night that one could be a stretch. Yeah. I think my favorite UM explanation that I had not heard about is infrasound. I think that's pretty cool. This to me, is it? Yeah, it's um low frequency sound waves that you cannot hear. You know, with your naked ear, you won't notice it, but it can cause your eyes to vibrate, It can cause you to see things, You can cause a sense of dread. UM and cracked. Actually, one of our favorite websites that a test at a concert. Didn't they Well, they reported on it. There's a they don't do test, that's right, they report on tests. But yeah, there's a great correct article on it. UM and they're talking about In the fifties, a guy named Vladismir Vladimir Gavreaux, robotics engineer, noticed that like one of his lab assistants was bleeding from an ear and traced it to UM. To this infrasound, I think it's like seven to nineteen hurts and UM. You can't hear it, like you don't realize you're hearing sound, but you're reacting to it. And like you said, it causes all sorts of like weird psychological effects like a sense of dread, a sense that there's somebody else near you. Um, all the classic telltale signs of hauntings, so much so that they've traced literal like hauntings back to infrasound. Yeah, The Ghost in the Machine is an article um by Victandy and Tony Lawrence that the same thing was going on there, and they traced it back to a fan and then they modified the fans housing. The sound went away and the supposed haunting went away, right exactly. I mean, isn't that weird that, like, surely you've been in a room before that you just had to turn around and run out of it because you just knew that there's somebody else in there with you. You have, I have plenty of times, But I think it's like I've been in like Savannah near you know, on the ghost tour. Like I'm highly suggestible what I'm saying. But isn't it strange to think that a sound that you can't hear it was responsible for producing that that? Like we're our brains are that malleable that like just the sound we can't even hear, but the vibrations we can still sense somehow are having an effect on our brain and scaring us and making us turn around and run out of room and potentially twitching your eye causing hallucinations. Right, so this sound has been shown. NASA showed that, um that an infrasound at that frequency can make your eye vibrate imperceptibly. But then something close to your vision, like say the rim of your glasses or something appear. Your brain confuses and things that that's moving, so it looks like there's a little dark figure moving out of the corner of your eye. Infrasound can actually cause visual and audit well not auditory hallucinations yea, psychological effects and visual hallucinations. So and the creation of a sense of dread. That's yeah, I want to get an infrasound machine. It's just like played around the office. You know, there may already be one here. Well, I don't even think we said what the guy did though at the concert? Did we know he played did he play it? Under the concert and people were freaking out? Yeah? I think like a quarter of the people at the concert reported feeling like horrible dread and like some nausea. Um, maybe because it was a doctor John show. That's the first awful thing I could think of Dr John's Crest. I know, I knew you were gonna say that. It really I mean, like you sued to see that guy played two pianos at once. Yeah, he's he's he's a legend. What am I talking about? You're thinking of? Um, maybe Dr hook and the Medicine Show. No Dr Demento. I was trying to think of the worst band I could think of, and that's the first thing that came to my mind. That's who you thought of. Nickelback is out there, Yeah, it was a Nickelback show. We can fix this in editing, okay. Um, so what else? I think? The last thing Tracy has here is that, um, the National Science Board is actually come out and said that if you believe in paranormal it can be dangerous because that means you have reduced critical thinking skills and can't make great day to day decisions. It's kind of mean. That irked me because on the other end of the spectrum, you can definitely make the case that just poo poo ing out of hand as non existent anything that science can explain. It shows a distinct lack of critical thinking and even more dangerously, a lack of imagination and that irks me to no end. Yeah, I enjoyed that you sent me the skep dyd Brian Dunning his article, and I kind of appreciated his approach with this, was like, you know, uh, maybe that means there's other cool ways to explain these things, like don't poopo it. Maybe open your mind to other interesting phenomenon that can be explained. Well, he was saying, don't just assume that if you just stop at it was a ghost, then there wasn't. Right, then you're you're pursuing. You're just you're not pursuing any longer, one way or another. And yeah, you're you're kind of shutting down these avenues that could be really interesting and eye opening. Appreciated that. I appreciated his approach too, because he's a huge skeptic and he's not He didn't take like a James Randy esque glee or delight and destroying the illusions of idiots, you know. Yeah, And I think that's his deal period as people. Uh, I think he gets accused of that oftentimes, as you know, a fun killer, and he's like, that's not what I'm trying to do here. I'm trying to apply research and real science too. Things. I think he likes killing fun a little bit. Maybe a little bit. So that's ghosts. Yeah done, yeah, uh for now.

Oh man, that was right in the wheelhouse. No, all right, you see. I'm a middle school teacher in Morgantown, North Carolina, recently relocated from Decatur, Georgia, where I worked at the brick Store and Squash Boston. Jerry's old hunts Um every two years. Our six and seventh grade students going a trip to the Science Academy. And we're a tiny school, just twenty four kids in the entire middle school teachers frequently end up driving on field trips themselves. It's about a seven hour drive, and on the journey we were played with traffic, rain, and car sickness. At about hour four, when tensions were high, was white and knuckled and began questioning my career voice, and I said, screw it, I'm gonna put on your podcast about ninjas. They were mesmerized.
