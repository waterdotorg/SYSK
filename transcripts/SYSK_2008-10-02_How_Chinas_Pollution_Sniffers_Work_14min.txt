Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should Know from House Stuff Works dot Com. Hi, and welcome to the podcast. My name's Josh. The guy across from his name's Chuck. Say Hi, Chuck, Hi, how are you hey? Chuck? You know, I was reading an article today and basically they've recently found out that air pollution, as if it weren't bad enough for your lungs, it actually interferes with your heart's electrical activity. You're kidding, No, No, I would not kid about that, Chuck. I take the hearts electrical activity very seriously. Yeah. So, um, basically, our bodies can kind of get rid of particles. Then there's fine particles, which are a little more difficult. Now we have something called ultra fine particles sub microscopic. They basically get into your body and just read all manner of havoc. And as far as I know, we weren't aware that it really interfered with any process of the heart up to this point. But yeah, basically, um, I think it was the Journal of the American Heart Association where this study was published, and when somebody undergoes some sort of heart surgery, that kind of thing, they recommend that they avoid traffic anyway, right, for stress levels. And yeah, because you know how upset you get in traffic. I've seen you don't. Don't pretend like you don't know. I take the subway, bro, I'm I'm traffic free, right, And why do you take the subway? Because traffic makes me crazy? Precisely so, they used to recommend that that heart patients stay away from traffic for two to three weeks after getting back from the hospital, and they still do, but now for this other reason, because you know, all this traffic pollution can interfere with your heart's electrical activity. Is this only big cities or is it across the board? Across the board, I would imagine, because I mean, if you're if you have your window rolled down and you're in any kind of traffic, you're just sucking that stuff. Course. And now some places are worse than others. I know one place where they would recommend you not drive after Where Where would that be? China? China? Yes, pretty much anywhere in China. There are some rural parts of China that are pretty clean. You know, lots of trees, that kind of thing. But just about any city in China is going to have a pretty high level pollution as a matter of fact, as far as I know. In two thousand and six, the World Bank Fine Bank UH conducted a survey of the twenty most polluted cities in the world. This is amazing to me. Sixteen of the twenty we're in China. I know that's four fifths, right, Yeah, that's four fifths by my math. That sounds good. That is a lot. So I don't know if Beijing fell off of that because they China pulled out all the stops to keep Beijing's pollution down. During the Olympics, well, I know, I remember watching I believe some was it cyclists, US cyclists that kind of caused a little bit of a stir when they showed up in Beijing wearing masks, breathing masks. I hadn't seen that. I know that all manner of athletes were saying that they may not go compete in Beijing because they took very seriously the damage it was going to do to their bodies. Yeah, they were walking around wearing masks, and a lot of people were pretty upset about that. Yeah, well, I mean, how can you play I've seen pictures. I've never been to Beijing, but unless these photos were retouched, it was it was pretty serious stuff. Well I think I know where this is leading. Yeah, I think you do too, because you know, we planned it out ourselves. Pollution sniffing, right. Um, there was a group that was assembled and as far as I know, they weren't assembled specifically for the Olympics. I don't think they've been disbanded. I guess is what I mean that the Olympics are over um to walk around a province in China, uh, the Guandong province. Please forgive me any anyone of Chinese ancestry or from China for that terrible, terrible pronunciation. But they walk around the Guandong province and sniff out air pollution and they're trained to do something, very highly trained. Actually, yeah, it's it's it's kind of an unbelievable thing, but it's really true. It is true. It is true. Again, I've never met any of these people, but I can tell you from all reports this is this is a real thing. Um. Basically, they took they took a group of I guess, above average smellers. I imagine that they're probably not smokers. There was some requisition, um, and they took them into this this laboratory and had them sniff different noxious smells to train their senses. Right yeah, yeah, but they did it very intensively. And there's actually a study um that came out of I think Northwestern UH that showed that the more you sniff a certain smell, the more of an expert you becoming in right, you can hone in and get more specific with it, because much more complex. So I mean, for example, if you smell a flower, a certain flower, first time you smell it, you've created a it's been codd there's a there's a sense memory in your brain memory and um, anytime you see at that kind of flower, that set membory is probably going to be triggered. So you'll be getting this visual information like, oh, there's that flower, and this is what it smells like. You know. Um, So once it becomes coated, it's there. But it can the complexity of our idea of what the thing smells like can be expanded and and subtracted from as far as the more he's fine. Sure, So this generally happens over time, Like you smell the flower once in a while, and you know with the China pollution sniffers. Uh, this was a very intensive training period. It was over and over again, smell the sulfur. Smell the sulfur. You have no choice, back of the net, kind of sac blocked in a room smelling these things. And it's not a pleasant task. And they even are on records it's saying that it is no fun. But because they were also trained to smell harmless smells as well noxious like like terribly offensive odors, but ones that weren't necessarily harmful. So aparently these people were trained to walk past any you know, garbage dump or smoke stack and go, you know, there's X amount of sulfur in there, and I smell a little black carbon and maybe some dog poop. That's not that bad, but it's in there. Sure maybe so maybe so spring roll to say the least. So. Uh. The one thing I never figured out was why I got the who, the how, the wind, the what. I never figured out the why Why would you train people to smell? Well, I would think because they could pinpoint, you know, pollution and do something about it. Or is that not the case. Well, we we could anyway with electronic sensors. Are you talking about the NASA device that's one of many. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure if you want, I've got car keys. I know you took the train, But we could go to radio shack right now, and I'm pretty sure we could probably find some sort of old factory sensing device, an electronic version of it check probably if it were a good radio check. It would depend on the location. Um, but I don't understand, like why you would train humans to do this. The the one clear point is you can send the radio check or the NASA old factory sensor out and it will report back. You know, there's this many parts per million of you know, carbon dioxide or sulfur or whatever in the air, but it's not gonna have any reaction a human would. So it's the human would be like, you know, oh, there's sulfur dioxide and I'm dying, which is really the one real drawback with the pollution. Exactly when you have humans doing this, it takes its toll on you know, not only their senses but their health. So it does make you wonder why they would send people in there. Precisely, and you never found out. No, I never had a clue and as a matter of fact, it was never spoken of in any of the articles I read when I was researching this. But um, it seemed to me the big elephant in the room, like these people are going to die horrible debts in the next few years. Well, and also there that seems like their smell would deteriorate or at least be you know, neutralized or something over time. Yeah, but they're they're recertified every three years. The schedule was every three years they would be re certified. So I guess that kind of shows that they weren't going to be disbanded after the Olympics. Um, because the the olfactory sense does deteriorate over time. But the exposure to these harmful chemicals, especially in the training uh seminar or segment of the of the the whole pollution sniffing academy, UM, I would think would really pose a serious health risk, right. I would think they would use that, you know, we're talking about the NASA thing and then to go the ENOS is what they call it. It was just a cute and of course is that love that name? And uh, they'd use that on the space Shuttle right to detect ammonia leaks, which makes a lot of sense that they wouldn't send a human up in the space shuttle to you know, sniff for money. It seems like it's around is or her next thing like ammonia sniffer or I break for ammonia right the well, the other the other argument against that, aside from you know, that being a suicide mission, is that a human just can't smell it as as well as this enos can um. You know, we can get you know, X number of parts per million. Let's say, you know, several hundred parts per million before we realize, oh, there's ammonia leak and I'm dead. This enos can sniff something like I think one part per million, one part per million, you're right, So it knows the ammonia leak is going on long before any human has even sniffed ammonia. You know how noxious and smelling ammonia is. So that's that's the purpose of the enos and it goes on. It's equally impressive um down here on Earth. It can tell the difference between coke and pepsi. That's so awesome, and not not by tasting obviously, no no, no, just by smelling, just by smelling, and the other one, Uh, it can sense it can it can sniff an electrical fire before the fire actually breaks out. Yeah, so so the Jet Propulsion Laboratories EENOS is a very valuable item to have on board when you're in space. Well, one thing I found interesting Joshua was reading this was the way smell works is is sort of like the way taste works. Yeah, we don't know, and I know we've talked about that. Well, I'm talking about specifically the shape of the smell receptors and taste receptors. Well, that's a that's the theory. They have the same theory for how we taste and how we smell. But they both boiled down to the fact that their their theories. We don't know for certain exactly what's going on. These are these are pretty good theories. You want to you want to tell them about the the receptor idea, Well, it's it's about the the shape, like a certain smell will fit a certain shape for the in the in the old factory bundle. Is that what it's called, Yes, the old factory nerve. Right, Well, these are receptors at the end, they're all specialized exactly, but not too specialized, because one thing it's found really interesting was that some of the molecules, the shape and structure, have completely different smells right there. That you can have two molecules that have the same shape, same structure, you can't tell anything any difference between them, but they have but they register as different smells, which kind of shoots a hole in the I think it's called the lock and key theory, which they have for tastes as well. Uh, certain certain molecules unlock a certain receptor, right, Um, so we've got the same thing for taste and in the same thing for smell, and they're both equally shoddy theories, although they're they're they're predominantly accepted theories. Right. But if if the smell molecules can be the same, if they can double up, does that explain things like maybe if your fart smells like lasagna. I think if your fart smells like lasagna, you may have some sort of synesthesia. I'm not entirely certain, but you may want to consult a physician if your fart smell like lasagna. I wasn't speaking personally, I just use as an example. That's okay, chuck, okay, okay. So um yeah, I think you have different different receptors can be assaulted at the same time to produce a combination. Um, much like jellybellies. You know have you have you ever eaten jellybelly? Jelly beans? I'm not a jelly bean guy. These things are not jelly beans alright. Anyway, if you get a bag of it on the back, it says like, you know too, blueberry plus one. I think toasted marshmallow creates like the flavor of like a blueberry muffin. So there's different recipes. Come up with your own. It's very fun. Are these the ones that are kind of nasty too? Like they have booger and across? I think you're confusing a Harry Potter with reality again. Well, um, maybe I am. They don't. I don't know, maybe they If anybody has hallapeno flavored jelly beans, it would probably be jellybelly. Um. But they they're they're generally pretty good. They have some pretty good ones, although they do have some that are non traditional, like coffee cappuccino and well, maybe we should send some of these to our pollution sniffing friends in China. Oh they could tell the difference, I guarantee. Yeah, so you got everything you got that, you got the pollution sniffers down. Yeah. I feel sorry for these guys. It's done something a great job. They volunteered, Yes, they volunteered. No one pressed them into service. Gereman now is long long dead and so yes, and they are paid probably pretty well, so don't feel too terribly bad. They're doing this on their own accord, and they're helping, you know, the people in Guangdong Province by keeping them from harm rightfully. So yeah, we sold me good.
