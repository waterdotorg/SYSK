Josh: Hello there, it's me Josh, and I just wanted to let you know, people living in Minneapolis or with access to Minneapolis, I'm going to be in your city doing my solo show, The End of the World or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Love Humanity. It's a gas and it's pretty interesting too. So in June I'll be at the Parkway Theater in Minneapolis, and the next night I'll be at the Miracle Theater in Washington, d C. So come see me. Go to the Miracle Theater dot com or the Parkway Theater dot com for tickets. Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of I Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm justus Chuck. There's Jerry Stuff you should know. You Jerk brad Oh, Jerry's back from vacation. Hello, Jerry, welcome back. Welcome back, Miss Rolling. You don't look any different. You're rolling your eyes at Josh. That means everything is normal. Normal. I thought you might be sun kissed, but she's nodding though she just wrote down helped me on the side. I saw that. I'm sure everybody heard the paper. Russell too, I have an announcement real quick if you don't mind. The Bryant's are back in the Cat Game. Got two kittens. Oh congratulations, thanks The cat Game. Yeah, the kiddie game where the cats name uh Luna and leave on and they You know, we've been planning this for a while since we lost our cats, but we had the house renovation. It was like, that makes no sense to get two cats in a rental house and move them. So then we waited, and then we were like, well, we're going out of town on vacation for Memorial Day, so let's wait after that. And we did. And I woke up on Sunday and looked at the calendar and I said, it's a cat day. Cat Day. So I went to the Humane Society. But Anna got to eight month old kittens. Siblings, Oh, matching cats. Boy and a girl wants a Luna is a girl and she's black and uh Levin is black and white, both short hair, which we're gonna try and recreate Lauren and the Wizard a little bit, you know that whole thing. Well rules that you have established, Well, we're gonna get a Tabby and another main coon because we really love those. But you're in a different direction. That's just like, you know what, you know, these are kittens, they're great, they need a home. Let's take them home. Well, you know what, dude, congratulations, thanks, it's been a lot of fun. Best wishes to the best of lifetime with Luna and LEVI. Well, you start at my age with cats. I was like, you know, this maybe one of the last bears. And Emily was like, stop, I know, I think it's don't even go there, stop doing mass you mean. And I have a friend who's a neighbor and she was like, you know, we're like, hold your dog. And she's like, oh, she's like three, so we'll probably pass. Said about the same time. I was like, why why would you say that out loud? Well, if these cats live a nice, healthy, longish life, they will see me into my mid sixties and see Ruby through high school. That's cute. That is that parts cute? So si um, so it's good that you're getting these kiddies for Ruby. In part for Ruby, I'm sure it's largely for you guys too. Yeah, it's for all of us. But she's going to run around growing up being exposed to cats. Are they going to be indoor outdoor cats. No, strictly indoor. Strictly indoor, they live longer. Still not judging, but no, it's fine, keep your cats. They kill fewer birds too, yes, um, but the fact that she's going to be exposed to cats is a big leg up for her. Yeah. And the fact that she was being licked in the mouth by dogs from the moment she was born. Yep, that's true too. But dogs cats different animals, true, which means yes, veried microbe, varied spit. And we're gonna get into why we're saying all this stuff soon enough. Just hold your horses, everybody, But um, what we're talking about is the hygiene hypothesis today. Yeah, and this is sort of the then diagram of several past episodes, including are some really good ones on allergies, the the immune system? Did we do one on the immune system? Either that or just the microbiome? Like, we definitely did that, but they may have been three, but if not, at least those two. And the hookworms episode, sure, yeah Southerners lazy and dumb right, Nope, it was hookworm. Um, yeah, we did do some good ones, but this is like, yeah, this is the stuff you should know A way is where we talk about all the stuff that has to do with the larger issue before we ever do larger issue. Yeah. And if you listen to the show for a long time, you're you're getting a pretty robust education. Yeah, and a lot of silliness. Yeah. So um, let's stop the silliness here. So uh, if you didn't realize, it's already prepared to have your socks knocked off. But we in the developed and rapidly developing world, right, Um, I'm just scanning my memory. That's the right term, correct, I think? So Okay, um our suffering what's known as an immunity crisis, like a massive one, the likes of which has probably never been seen before in human history. And it's happening at the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the pop of a spit bubble, right like that fast in evolutionary terms. To be fair, Josh just said that because I popped the spit bubble in his mouth while he was talking. That's sort of one of my chores. I got some stats between ninety and the year two thousand rates of hay fever, eczema, asthma, and type one diabetes, and he's all have to do with immune dysfunction, uh sort of three D and developed and developing countries since nineteen yep, between fifty and two thousand, and children born in the UK in nineteen seventy were twice as likely to get XIMA than those born in nineteen and there. I mean, there are tons of stats we could keep reading, but all of this flies in the face of what you would think would be happening, which is, as we get you know, more medically advanced and our world gets more sanitized, sure like everything, people should be getting sick less and have more robust immune systems, and the complete opposite is happening. Yeah, and it really has been confounding people because there's a couple of factors, or there's a couple of things here that this evidence is screaming. Number one is happening really fast. Number two is happening in a distinct part of the world, right, the developed world. Um. But it's also happening over time too, in the same places. Yeah. But the first one is hapening so fast that rules out genetics because genetics doesn't operate that fast. No, no, and um, so it's clearly environmental. That's what everybody's settled on and um again, it was confounding everybody for a very long time. And then in nine there are a lot of people who tried to explain this. And in ninety nine there was an British epidemiologist named I think you pronounced his last name is Strahan? Oh, really Strachen Stratching, the Kraaken name, or Michael Strahan, one of the two, one of those or Michael Shannon. Let's throw him in the mix. Two. Man, he's good. So David Stratching, I'm just going with that, um he. He and some colleagues released a very short paper in the British Medical Journal in nine and it said, we think we might actually have this figured out. What's going on beyond behind this confounding immune of the crisis, Why everyone's bodies are turning on themselves, whether immune systems are going haywire and crazy. Um, we think it's because things are too clean actually right. And he didn't actually use the term, but the word hygiene was in the title of the paper. But right after that people said, I like the way you're thinking. We're gonna call what you're talking about the hygiene hypothesis, but first explain to us what you're talking about stretching, right, I mean basically he was saying that if you're a little baby that's born and raised up through your early very important uh immunity developing years to about age four the most important. Yeah. So, uh, if if you were cleaning everything too much and slathering everything in hand sanitizer and keeping your child inside in a in a protective, clean play place, then they are not being exposed to the they're too clean, not being exposed to the germs that they need to develop a robust immune system. Right. That was his interpretation of some evidence. The actual study that the paper was based on. It was a study he carried out of I think seventeen thousand British households kids in particular. Yeah, and he found that kids born into smaller families had a higher chance of developing allergies as they grew older compared to kids born into larger families. Yeah, which is supported his theory, right, which is that because there's more people in a family, there are more people bringing germs into the home, exposing the little kid to the germs um more frequently at an earlier age, and that those germs somehow protect us from developing allergies later on. That's that was the basis of we have to say the original hygiene hypothesis because a lot of people don't know it, but it's changed dramatically since then. Yeah, and people got on board. It made sense. Um, still kind of makes sense in some ways. And uh, it made a lot of news, and people really kind of got on this train of let's not have any kids or just have one, sure, and let's let them roll around a dog poop. Right, it did get translated really quickly into let's all stop washing our hands because initially the thing that was identified was infections. That kids develop infections from infectious pathogens, and that being exposed to infections early on actually trains the immune system and makes it basically bulk up. It makes it gives you a beefy immune system later on, and more to the point, a smart one. And really we should probably talk about what the immune system does to really get home what's stratch And and all of his colleagues and everybody in the world was thinking. Was actually going on, Yeah, should we take a break and talk about a little do a little allergy recap all right, so you can refer to our allergy episode for the full picture. But um, but here's sort of an assessment, an overview, if you will. And that is, and I remember when we said this in the initial episode, an allergy is basically a mistake. It's a yeah, like, there's nothing inherently wrong with dust or pollen. Those things are great. They're not actually foreign invaders that are going to harm your body. No, there's nothing wrong with dust. People avoid dust because they're allergic to it. But it's not like dust has some inherent property that gets in your nose and makes you sick. You're allergic, Well, it makes you allergic, it does, but it doesn't make you sick. But it's not the dust's fall, I think, is what you're trying to say. It's your stupid immune system's fault. No, your immune system says this is a harmful invader, even though it's really not. It's pollen or dust or something, and let's mount a defense against this. And that is what triggers this allergic response, which is, you know, we'll govern that in detail, but everyone knows what that is. It's in the case of dust and pollen, it's you know, sneezing and inflammation in the nose. Yeah, scratchy throat redness, maybe a rash, depending on what kind of allergen you're talking about. But it's all just a big mistake. Do you just made It's really serious, but it's okay. So it is a mistake, and this this is why mistakes like allergies happen. Okay. The immune system. You're born with an immune system that says I'm ready to learn, I'm thirsty for knowledge. It's remarkable, right, it actually trains and like we said earlier, that first four years are really important. It's basically when your immune system learns to recognize what's a actual for an invader that I need to defend against, a mountain immune response against. And what's just a normal, harmless or maybe even friendly microbe in the environment like dust or pollen. Such a friendly microbe, right, it really has a good personality as far as cat hair it goes. Yeah, So what happens is when that immune system meets uh, something harmful, truly harmful, it creates an antibody and it's very customized. It's not like you said earlier. It's a very smart system. It's not just a one size fits all deal. Because your body is trying to get very specific with how it's going to deal with these invaders for the rest of your life. Right. Um, So, when when a foreign microbe, friendly or harmful or totally neutral, comes into your body, you have a multi layered system immune system. It's actually really two layers to tell you the truth. There's the innate immune system and then you have the adaptive immune system them. And the innate immune system is basically that's what you're born with. It's the Blaster from Master Blaster okay, okay, which was Blaster. I think Blaster was the big like like crushed skull guy of course, and then Master was the master the road on his shoulders. So Blaster gets his meaty paws on a microbe what seems to be a foreign invader, and it doesn't matter what it is, Blaster does the same thing to it. He crushes them up and eats them and digests them and then poops out the the the parts of that invader, that microbe that make that microbe that microbe um the proteins on the outside of the microbe called antigen's okay, and it says, look at this, and it shows the adeptive immune system what it's got. Yeah, so that innate immunity you're you're born with it, and it's it's sort of like, h like mom is going to pass on some like cobra coverage almost right, You get this like temporary verry insurance that that mom is kind enough to pass on, and that covers you for a little while while your body is sort of learning how to do it on its own. With Master. I'm sorry, Blaster sort of leading the way at first. So where you left off was it presents it to Master and says, here, uh do with this? What you will start learning? Right? What is this that I just chewed up? That's two John Travoltas in one episode you know that was vide Barbarino and what's the other one? I just regular John? Why you swee so um? When Blaster spits out these antigens, says, what is this? Check it out? Master's job now, Master is the adaptive immune system. The second part, This is a more nuanced, smarter um selective or supposedly selective part of your immune system where it looks at this stuff and somehow, some way, I don't understand exactly how it does it. Maybe we touched upon it in our immunity episode, but the adaptive immune system Master says, Okay, this is actually not harmful at all. Don't worry about building in anybody. You can forget about that. And as a matter of fact, don't forget about it. But the next time you see this thing, just let him on through. He's the friendliest cat hair you're ever going to meet. Don't kill him next time. Yeah, Or if it's an if it's an actual foreign invader and everything is going smoothly and correctly, then the adaptive immune system is going to say, well, whoa, whoa, this is a really dangerous thing you've just presented me with. We're going to study its weaknesses and we're going to build a molecule that is designed to kill this thing with extreme prejudice. Yeah, it turns into Clint Eastwood all of a sudden. Yes. Um. While this is going on in the background, we should mention that uh blaster has already set off the He's basically walled things off with an inflammatory response. Yeah, and not like something you know, mean that he said to Master, Not that kind of inflammatory response, but why are you so short? But regular A regular inflammatory response is sort of the big dumb guy's way to deal with something. It's like, all right, while you figure this out, just let me puff up and let me cause a rash or give give you a fever or you know. There's all sorts of inflammatory responses. Yeah, blasters responsible for what you think of when you think of uh an infection. Yeah, you're fighting out like me last week. Now, I had that weird virus. Yeah it's gone, it's gone. Great, that is weird. It is weird. Um, but I had we had Emily and I both had all sorts of things weird bumps and lumps and rashes and fever. Yeah it was. It was not good. But um, so that's the inflammatory response is going on while Master is working on his plan rights sort of like a first line of defense almost. So we have to so Julia Layton put this one together and like we have to go or the four the four key components of the inflammation response. Okay, okay, you've got calor, dolor, rub or, and two more. It sounds like Game of Thrones or something. It does. It's heat, pain, redness, and swelling. Yeah, and when you put them all together, you're like, yeah, of course it's analogy. That's an infection. That's what happens when something tries to get my body. Blaster goes and and brings this on. Right. Yeah, and man, every time we study the immune system, it just blows me away. I love it. It's just amazing that humans can do this. Yeah, you know so, um yeah, we're not even trying. No, we're just sitting around watching Well I'm not watching Thrones. But do you watch that? No? Did you? I watched the first few seasons and dropped off. Yeah. Apparently you pulled out just in time. M according to Reddit, Well, I know everyone said one through seven was great. Okay, so you did in foresaw seven? Now I saw like one through three and then just got confused and went to sleep. It was using, Oh yeah, there's a lot going on. Yeah, you have to keep up with the characters and storylines, and it just got too too much. I was just like, yeah, okay, I'm gonna go back and watch uh Company again. Right. I can't wait for that. I watched um Berry, have you been watching Barry? Now? I need I watched a few episodes on a plane I started. Yeah, I need to get Emily on the on the Berry train. It's very good. It is good. Yeah, that's a good show and VP. Of course I need to watch the last season of V I'm not on that same here, okay, So anyway, slight digression, Keller, Dolor, rub Or, and two more Um and Blaster. The innate um immune system is basically creating this to to keep the infection localized. Wow, the adaptive system Master is figuring out what to do and building the anybody. So once all this happens, that anybody is released, it goes in and destroys the whatever remaining microbes of that foreign invader are still around, and the body is saved. And even better, somehow your immune system remembers this. Yeah, that's the important part, right, so that the next time Blaster comes along and comes back with that same that same micro but the same kind of microbe. Master says, I know just the thing for this guy. We've met him before. We're gonna get this anybody over here, and it's going to destroy them and the body will just keep coming along with the immune system mounting normal um appropriate responses, and your body, all your cells are just screaming. Two men enter, one man leave the whole time. It's very uh, it's kind of disturbing actually under a microscope. Should we talk about T cells? Yeah, didn't you say we're quickly going to go over the immune system. I mean, we don't have to talk about T cells. No, No, I'm just saying we've talked about different being quick we talked about them a lot in the past. Yeah, but not to this this degree, and they actually are pretty important in this all right, Well, so remember that blaster the innate immunity. Uh dude, Remember any microbe it gets his hands on, it does the same thing to Too bad for the microbe. So he's going to present that that microbe's antigens to these t Helper cells T cells that we've talked about before, and they are part of Master's smarter system. And like earlier when he said he presents it, what he's really doing is presenting to those T helper cells. Right, So there's T helper cells that are undifferentiated. There's kind of floating a long waiting to be told what to become. And then Master says, you turn into some th h one cells. Because this is a bacterial or a viral infection. Th H one cells are are um specialized to combat that kind of microbe or if say it's a hookworm infection um they would turn into th H two cells, or if it's an allergy or an allergic response, it means th H two cells are involved too. And this is here the key to the original interpretation of the hygiene hypothesis. Yeah, and the th H one it's it's sort of a they do a lot of things, but th H one generally work on the inside of cells and th H two generally work on the outside of cells. They sort of split up and they sort of balance each other out too. That's a big, big key to Yeah, like if there are more th H one cells, there will be less th H two and the other way around. Right, they kind of regulate one another, or more like more to the point, t T regulator cells regulate th H one and th H two cells. Yeah, the T REGs, which we didn't find out about until like the two thousand's right, But if there are this is the point here. If there are a lot of th H two cells, there's not going to be very many th H one cells, and vice versa. And so the original interpretation of the hygiene hypothesis was that kids who are not exposed to bacterial or viral infecttions early on in life, do not have a chance for their immune system to learn what's good what's bad. And since their th H one cells aren't activated because they're not exposed to pathogens, um, they're th H two cells, the ones that are responsible for allergic reactions, get to go into hyper drive and being responsible for allergic reaction th H two cells kind of like a hammer into a hammer, everything looks like a nail. So to the th H two cells, everything looks like a foreign invader, and so an allergic response is mounted. So because the kids th H one cells weren't active enough, the th H two cells were overactive, they weren't exposed to infections, they developed allergies later in life. That's what they thought was the crux of the hygiene hypothesis, and that it was all because we're we were living in a world as far too clean for our own good. Yeah, And you know, there are more studies that they did that really seem to support this in the in the nineties, UM, really interesting one in the Germany's UH in the early nineties they did in a study of allergy rates of East and West German kids pre unification. Obviously, and this was a really great idea, because what you had was two populations that were genetically identical, basically just living in two drastically different environments. Obviously, East Germany was very polluted, it was generally more poor, um much more industrialized, and in the West it was you know, cleaner probably and cleaner but cleaner for sure, and kind of all the way around. And so they hypothesize. There was a researcher named Edeka von Mutious that's good enough. I think that's exactly right. And she basically, you know, said, well, clearly, the children from the West will be healthier and less allergic, and she found the exact opposite again, so it was just another s of some more compelling evidence that this hygiene hypothesis kind of carried a lot of weight. Yeah, and the fact that she was expecting the opposite was kind of interesting too. But she was like, whoa, I just accidentally proved this hygiene hypothesis because it doesn't again, it makes zero sense that the cleaner the environment, the more likely your immune system is to malfunction later in life. Right, should we take a break? Yeah, all right, we'll take a break and we'll talk about sort of where this is now in the new understanding that hasn't gotten nearly enough press. Right. Okay, so the world really clamped onto a hygiene hypothesis because I mean it makes a lot of sense, Like it's very appealing. It's like, yeah, just go be dirty, you don't have to worry about all this stuff. And yeah, pesticides are are terrible for us, so as antibacterial soap, and you know, just everything you can think of. Um. The idea of it was was really or really just kind of appealing to the world, especially in the nineties because that's when people started caring about like herbs and supplements and like organic food and stuff like that. So the timing was really good. And the idea of looking at all these chemicals we're using to sanitize our world is actually harmful rather than beneficial appealed to a lot of people. But it also appealed to people in the sense that now we had an explanation for this mysterious massive explosion in in allergic um reactions and immuno messed up function. Right. Sure, did you know type one diabetes is a um um an immuno efficiency Just from this, Yeah, me too. I had no idea was like why did they keep talking about diabetes, and then I realize your body has mistaken the beta cells that produce insulin and your pancreas as a foreign invader and attacks them. That's why you don't have insulin enough insulin, because your body is turned on it. Very interesting, same with like crones and um uh, any kind of autoimmune disorder. Really, yeah, your body is mistaking the cells of your own body as a foreign invader. But again, these the incidents of these these kinds of disease just exploded over you know a handful of decades and by the nineties and about two thousand people had said it was because we're overly clean. We're killing off the pathogens that we actually need to infect our kids so that their bodies can recognize a good invader from a bad invader and they won't develop allergic reactions later on. Right, Well, today we now know that the hygiene hypothesis wasn't quite right. It's been It's not like they threw it all out, but it's been revised and and it's a lot smarter now, and they're the basic theory now is is that what's missing it's not necessarily a hygiene thing, but it's nature. And they have a name for it, which is very cute, the old Friends theory, and this is introduced by a fellow name Graham Rook in his Colleagues and two thousand three, and this basically theorizes that exposure to these harmless microbes, not the pathogens or what's going to protect you from allergy sensitization. So, uh, kids playing in the dirt and kids getting looked in the face by a dog in the years one through three and four is actually a really good thing. Doesn't mean you shouldn't wash your hands after you poop or just let that chicken, pull that raw chicken off the counter and don't sweat it. You should still practice um basic hygienes. But kids being inside all the time and not being exposed to nature like they were for hundreds of thousands of years is the sort of the problem, right, And it's part of the problem. Why this is why why it was easy before and not now, is because they're saying, um, yes, do wash your hands, but not all the time. So what they've identified is those pathogens that they originally thought we were killing, and um, it was having a detrimental effect on us. The opposite is true. They found that we really should keep washing our hands and killing off things like the stuff you get from chicken juice, raw chicken and coop and like infectious disease. We need to keep fighting that like we are. It's actually a huge benefit we need to keep, like getting vaccinated. We need to um defend against colds and the flu and all this stuff like that is something we want to keep it pay not exposed kids to that. We found the opposite is true. Actually, exposure to things like colds and flues and measles in childhood actually increases the likelihood of developing allergies later in life, which is the opposite of the original hygiene hypothesis. But what they found is so we need to keep defending against those infectious pathogens, but we need to up our exposure to those friendly microbes, the ones friends, the ones we the old friends that our bodies co evolved with over these hundreds of thousands or millions of years, and that we've realized now just beginning to realize, uh, make up a symbiotic relationship with us, or at the very least some sort of relationship. We depend on them, and by not being exposed to as many microbes as we were in decades past before everybody got obsessed with being clean. Um, we are. Immune systems are not functioning properly, whether it's they're not being trained early on enough or they're just not being exposed to the right kind of microbes that form colonies like in our gut or on our bodies somewhere. Yeah. And what's really, um, sort of the newest uh concern as the rise in food allergies. Um, it's really like you grew up in the seventies and eighties, do you ever remember peanut allergies being a thing? Zero? I knew zero kids who had peanut Yeah. I mean we just like slathered ourselves in peanut butter growing up constantly. Yeah, there was a trend. Yeah, it exploded in the West in the in the nineties and it continues to rise. They're calling it the second wave of allergy, the second epidemic. Basically, one in ten kids in the developed world have food allergies. That is nuts. And that's just in the developed world. I think in America. It's in America, it's yeah, one in five has a food allergy in America. Yeah, and like serious allergy sometimes like I have a friend whose sisters son is. I mean, this kid's allergic to everything you could imagine. And it's not like that's the outlier. Like you hear about more and more cases like that. Yeah, one in five kids has a food allergy G And like again, in the eighties, there was no such thing as a peanut allergy basically, I mean, they were, but it was just vanishingly rare. Yeah, And it's not like we didn't we just didn't know what to call it back then. A kid would peanut and drop dead. We call the balloon faced syndrome. God, that's terrible, but uh, yeah, it's a real thing that's happening. Food allergies are just off the charts now compared to how they used to be. Yeah. So that, like you said, that's the second wave of this. And what what they're thinking is going on is kids are less exposed to the microbes that we used to be more exposed to because we're spending more time inside because we're using way more disinfectants. And it's good we're using the disinfectants because they do kill the pathogens that we do want to keep at bay, but they kill indiscriminately, so they also kill all the friendly microbes that actually perform wonderful benefits for like the healthy functioning of our immune system. Yeah, the harmless bacteria that that children need to be exposed to and adults. Right, although they do think that when you are exposing kids to microbes, or when you are being exposed to microbes like you and I, um, it's probably not doing a lot for us. Yeah, because our immune systems are already developed. It really counts for kids, like from birth up to about four years of age, because again, that's when your immune system is being trained, and if it's being trained by a bunch of friendly microbes saying that's okay, blaster, you can kill me, just make sure you don't kill any of anyone else like me because I'm fine, I'm not gonna do anything to you. Then then that is what's creating the healthier immune system and lowering the risk of allergies later on. Yeah, so they recommend you know, getting your kids out in nature, let them play in the dirt. Uh. If you can breastfeed, then that helps. If you can have a vaginal birth, that helps. Although I saw a study that's that showed um children born from c set shin were swabbed in um vaginal fluid from their mother's birth canal to give them like this coating of micrubs like they would have gotten from a vaginal birth. So they do that. They did it to like four kids in this one study and the results were mixed. And then another study found six weeks after birth. They this study didn't find any difference in um microbial makeup between kids who were born vaginally and kids who were born through c section, So it might not be as big of an issue as we thought. Well, they definitely say to practice target what they called targeted hygiene, which, like you were saying, it's not like you don't clean up after the raw chickens on the counter or wash your hands after you poop, but um, get rid of the snotty tissues and wash your hands after you do those things and blow your nose right, wash your hands after you use the bathroom. Yeah, but start washing your hands again. Everybody is the key. But get out there and play in the dirt too. And uh, it's like a kid. Kids should be in nature. Okay, so yes, playing the dirt, go out in the woods, go for a hike, get your kid a dog, or a cat, ye, and let them hug and kiss take them to a petting zoo. Like that's like you don't have to This is the point. You don't have to like attack your kid with the antibacterial spray on their hands after they pet goat at the petting zoo. It's actually what they're finding is that it's healthy for the kid to pet the goat and then eat a sandwich afterward. Seriously, No, I know, this is uh, it's all making sense now because we have ten goats that live across the street. Always had two dogs and two cats in the house, except for the brief period where we didn't have the cats, and we were very lazy parents and still don't bathe our daughter with much regularity every every week or three. No, but she uh, she's she's been like take her to the doctor sick four times. Yeah. Well, and then hopefully it will also mean that as she gets older, she is going to be less far less likely to have allergies because their immune system so trained. Like Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union put together, that's a super couple. Yeah. Yeah, you've seen their kids, theirs, the oldest son that's about to start playing basketball, Brownie. They're transferring to the same high school. So Lebron's son and Dwayne Waite cent are gonna play basketball. And he looks just like Dwayne Wade, does he really? Yeah, has her sleepy eyes. It's like, no mistaking whose kid that is. That's very cool. It's not the Milkman. No, it's Dwayne Waite unless the milkman had sleepy eyes. Who was a basketball player? That was the mailman Clive Drexler, Karl Malone. No, Karl Malone was a mailman. Clyde Drexler was the glade. That's right. Yeah, you're right. He also is on the just for main commercials. Are you watching the finals? Oh yeah, pulling for Toronto pretty hard? Who's not. Did you see that map of the US and who's pulling for Golden State? And who's pulling? Just like the Bay Area and nowhere else. It was California and Hawaii and then the rest of the country was pulling, pulling for another country. Yeah exactly. Wow, So go raptors, That's what I say. If you want to know more about the hygiene hypothesis, go back and listen to this episode again, because there's real nuance there, and I hope we got it all. Maybe we should re record this again. Yeah, it's like now, okay, okay, anyway, Uh, we'll see what version comes out. And in the meantime, it's time for what Chuck Administrating Details.
