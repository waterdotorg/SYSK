Josh: Welcome to Stuff you should know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, I'm welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W Chuck Bryant. Jerry's with us as well, and we all have a nice They're a hay sticking out of our teeth. Got a hat on. It's a derby. Doesn't quite fit right, but is it still a hat? And I'm wearing overalls with nothing underneath and no shoes and socks. Have I told you my uh Olan Mills story? No? I can't not. When I lost my two front teeth, my mom promptly took me to Olan Mills. And there is a picture in existence. I'll try and find it and put it on my Instagram um of me in front of a like a lazy river scene or a lake or something, with overall shorts and you know, cut off overalls, I guess, nothing else on, no shirt, no shoes, and like, uh, I love to see it. I feel like I had like a cane pole and maybe a straw. Hateez? Did they did they have the the the engraving and stone mountain and as the background? No, thank goodness, I just it was straight up cosplay it's very embarrassing, but I'll see if I can find that and throw it up on Chuck the Podcaster Instagram. You should, Chuck. I think that would really garner some likes, you know, putting a few old pictures up there every now and then. It's fun. That's very cute. Um. So, I guess you're saying, you're we're talking about wearing nothing but overalls because we're talking about farming, right, Yeah, I mean that that picture Basically I learned all I needed to know about farming that day, which is I'm not cut out for it. I'm not cut out for it. I am cut out to be photographed for money. Whoa, Um, that was me doing my impression of you. Yeah. I didn't get paid. Uh yeah, I guess that's the opposite. Happened Your mom paid somebody take pictures of you regardless, Um, none of that really happens in farming. Maybe people running around with overalls on probably has something underneath the overalls. But for the most part, this is a gross misconception of of what farming is. Especially now that I've done some research on the current state of farming, We're pretty far from the whole idea of people running around with hey in their and their mouths and wearing overalls and nothing. But sure, I mean, well, it depends on who you are. Like, have you ever seen and I've talked about it before the documentary The Biggest Little Farm. Yeah, I think you have talked about that. I don't remember what episode it was in there, And we'll get to that. That's coming up on the the last part of this episode about agro ecology, but that those are people that are adherents of bringing it back to what farming used to be, which was ecologically sound, harmonious with nature, that kind of thing, right, which makes a tremendous amount of sense. But we'll see if that's even possible in the future, because here's the thing. There's a huge um boom in demand for agriculture that we are on the presiposs of it. Actually, I guess you could make a pretty good case that we're in the midst of it right now. Um, by the year there's a predicted somewhere around nine to ten billion. It's a pretty big gap. But let's say nine to ten billion people are expected to be running around on planet Earth, right, and all those people are going to need to be fed. But the thing is is we're not exactly sure how we're going to reach that increased demand. And because there is a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the u M that said that we're basically going to have to increase food production UM compared to two thousand seven levels by seventy to feed all those people. And that's that's if we hit the low and the nine billion UM in population by Yeah, and you mentioned agriculture, Um, we're also talking meat in protein because not only is the population increasing, but income is on the rise worldwide, especially in developing countries. And as you are developing country that gets a little more money in your pocket as individuals, you want to eat more meat in protein. So um, I think they said global meat consumption is going to arise by about sevents. Well, yeah, and when you're talking about meat um consumption as far as agriculture goes, like, you're talking about agriculture times too, because not only do you have to use all those inputs to grow the cattle themselves, the livestock themselves, so um you can eat them, you have to feed them to get them ready to be eaten, right, So you have to grow the food to feed to the cattle that you're going to grow that you're going to eventually eat. So there's a lot of agriculture that's going to have to be going on. Um. But here's the thing. Agriculture has handled this before. There was a time you and I have talked about countless times, um, the Green Revolution back in the early mid twentieth century. There are a lot of people saying, UM, we're not exactly sure that agriculture is going to be able to keep pace with the growing population. And we think probably about a billion people are going to starve. And that may have happened, we will never know, but we know that it didn't happen thanks to the green revolution that was hastened by scientists like Norman Borlog. Yeah, we've been talking about that guy for a year. And the irony of the green revolution is is today's terminology. You might think that has something to do with, um, environmentally sound practices. It was kind of the opposite of that in a lot of ways. Uh, they've meant green just like a lot of plants. Uh, it was really harmful to the environment. It did feed a lot of people, and there's a lot of mixed um mixed reviews on Yelp about the green revolution. I guess, uh, that's an easier way to say controversy because what happened is a lot of the greenhouse gas emissions that we see uh in the world today come from food production. We've talked about methane coming from cowpoots before, We've talked about it's real big problem. We've talked about deforestation. Um obviously transportation getting this food and transporting it, you know, because the idea we kind of went away from the idea of local farms feeding regions into shipping food across the globe if we need to, and that's just a lot of pollution. I think raising livestock and fish accounts for about of agricultures greenhouse emissions, with livestock being about Yeah, so this whole So we've we've reached this an inflection point that really resembles the last inflection point where Okay, we're about to have a big increase in population. We need to make sure that agriculture can keep up with food production to feed everybody, or else we're gonna have big problems. But this time there's an added twist and that we know the last thing we did kind of wreck to the environment. So now we have to figure out, Okay, how are we going to meet this challenge this time without further wrecking the environment and then maybe even figuring out a way to um help the environment through food production. That's kind of where we're at right now. And agriculture has gone through different iterations, and right now supposedly we're in agriculture three doto And what every but he's trying to figure out is what comes next? What's agriculture for dotto? Yeah? One one point oh? You say dot? Yeah, okay, one point oh was from Neolithic to the nineteen twenties. So that was boy, that had a good long run, didn't it. Yeah, that's a good long stretch, a very good long stretch. But that included a lot of labor from human hands and animal hoofs uh two point oh? Was that green revolution we were talking about? Three point I was about ten or eleven years ago when big data kind of came in to help maximize yields. And it's uh, they're saying like four point needs to start happening now, and sort of is We're just not exactly sure what the final iteration is gonna look like yeah, and a lot of the stuff that's going on in three Datto is going to make an appearance in four Duto. But it's gonna be that's a way to say it. Sometimes points so yeah, of course, although it reminds me. Have you watched Cobra kai Uh? We watched the first like four or five episodes and then we're like, I get it. Same here. Um, But that one where Johnny's handing out flyers for his new website, He's like, check out this cool website. H T T P colon slash slash w w W period Cobra guy period c O M. They just spelled it out while he was handing out a flocker. But he says period. He didn't say dot. That's really funny. Well two period of three periodo he uh it was. That was great. Yeah, it was a great premise that they really pulled off for a little while there. So now whenever you say to Dot, oh, I'll say do you have a problem, Mr Clark, Yeah, and I'll say no mercy, no mercy, Yeah, okay, Um, that's the new response to that question. But you don't say it like that. You don't go no, mercy. Oh you don't say it, director, No mercy. Uh, okay, let me try keep them ready. No mercy. Very intimidating. Thank you. Where were we? We were talking about what four dotto is going to look like? Yeah, because here's the deal. Uh, farmers themselves, the human beings are getting older. Um, farmers over sixty five years old out number uh those under forty five years old by two to one, actually a little more than two dot one to one dot one. Know those are Colin's my friend. Know there's a dot to dot one. Oh man, I feel like this is gonna happen. Um. So one of the first kind of things that people think may happen, and that we're already seeing some is consolidation of farms. Instead of a lot of medium, too small sized farms, how about few are really big farms. And you know that's already kind of been happening. Yeah. And like in a normal industry, let's say the kazoo manufacturing industry, if like the kazoo makers were way old and there weren't very many young kazoo makers, that wouldn't fare very well for the kazoo industry, but no one would really care. We wouldn't miss kazoos all that much, would be Okay, farming does not really fall within that same category as kazoos, Like we need food. So rather than farming just going away, they're just going to figure out how to consolidate it with fewer, younger farmers with bigger farms under their belt, right, which you know, if you think there's fewer farmers, so you consolidate the farms. That makes sense, But you're like, you still need people because these farmers are getting older and ostensibly, you know, farm hands are getting older as well. But here's where uh four dot four period oh comes in is robots. As John Hodgman would say, yeah, oh man, I didn't hear it in any other way every time I read it. Yeah, because there's a lot of inefficiencies in traditional farming with farm hands. I mean, just one example is when you fertilize an area. You know, you can fertilize like a platt, but you fertilize that whole plat. If there's a part of that plat that doesn't need fertilizing, it's probably gonna get fertilized anyway, just because you know, they just run the fertilizer over that area, right exactly. It's just that's just what is the most efficient. And as we'll see, like that's a that's a real problem. That's sad that that's the current way to do it, but that's conventional farming practices. You just fertilize the whole field and go on and do something else, because there's a million other things that need to be done as well. But one of the things, um that's going to be uh kind of saved in that way by by robots is um They're going to take these different steps that are involved in UM farm work and kind of um break them down into uh, um, what's the word I'm looking for, chuck where where you know, Oh, specialties. So a robot specializes in a certain task or whatever. And because you'll have a bunch of different robots they doing the same task, they'll be able to kind of give more personal tailored care to the to the plants. Say like some plants need fertilizer, those plants will get fertilizer. Plant doesn't need fertilizer, it's not going to get fertilizer. And that's going to save a lot of UM inputs. Is kind of what you talk about when you're in talking agriculture UM, which kind of is generally a good thing, not just financially, but when it comes to the environment as we'll see. Yeah, and you know, you think about a tractor that requires a human to drive that tractor. Uh, they already have tractors that can drive themselves with GPS accuracy involved. And you know that's been going on for a little while now. And the idea I think is UM. And you know, some of these tractors are something called the lettuce bot, which is kind of cool, where basically have a tractor at least that's sort of the current iteration, and on the back of that tractor is a big row of I mean, we call them robots. It's not like you know, George Jetson type of stuff. A robotis just means it's a mechanical, you know, automated system. Right, it's not they're not looking for a husband like. So the lettuce bot is pulled along behind the tractor and it's got you know, just a big row of little robots that can do everything from UM kind of custom fertilization to picking out a weed using the same technology that they use in facial recognition like there's a ragweed or something, let's get rid of just that weed instead of like let's just spray the whole field with round up or whatever. Uh. And it's you know, it's going to increase efficiencies. And I think that's the first iteration. And what they're looking at in the future is instead of even a big tractor that still costs a lot of money, Yeah, like hundreds of thousands of dollars for a new track. I think, like it doesn't really dawn on city slickers how incredibly expensive farm equipment is. Yeah, those big, big tractors, not like you're sort of fun tractor. No, not a fun tractor, sure, that's like fifty grand, who cares, but like a really big tractor. Yeah, it's a lot of money. Um. So I think the idea is, or at least what I saw, there's conceptual drawings of smaller uh robot tractors that are I don't know, it looked like the size of like a like a six foot folding table or something just kind of going over like a row of lettuce, Like it's that it's in charge of that one row. Probably, Yeah, But what I wonder is how expensive are those and do you have to get fifty of those to equal one tractor? And how does it suss out financially? I mean, I'm sure that like there's a maximum number that you would possibly need, or else you're like, I have more than I can use. And then you have you have a farm that like doesn't make quite as much money as another farm, so they make do with half the number of robots, and that maybe they have to supplement that with humans or whatever, um or it takes longer for that to be done, or they can grow less lettuce. But I'm sure that like there's from what I read, there's a price point where like having robots is going to be financially way better than having to sink hunt several hundred grand into a new tract or even like a hundred and fifty grand for a use tractor. And then the other thing, and this is really important to number one, you don't need a human to drive these things, which frees the human up to do other things, or you don't have to pay the human anymore, So that's gonna save you some money. And then secondly, um, if one of those robots breaks down, you can still work all the other rows. If the tractor breaks down, You're you're done. You have to wait until the try just fixed, and then all of that work has to wait. This is just one single say row that isn't getting attended to right then while that one robot's broken down. So that's a huge advantage right there. Yeah, and you can just tell robot number two to scoot over and cover the ground that robot number one is missing exactly, and he's like, I gotta pull a double Shut up. You're a machine. You can't talk. The other thing robots can potentially do is harvest. Harvesting is very labor intensive, and it's also kind of inefficient, especially when it comes to something like um, maybe like strawberries, which you harvest one time during the year, and you know there there's still a little bit of leeway in there. Like it's it's not an exact science in that some of those plants will have ripe fruit before you go to harvest and it'll rot and drop off. Some of them may need to wait a little bit and ripen afterward, so you're wasting a lot of fruit there on the ground. And robot harvesters would just constantly kind of patrol these rosa plants and harvests the berries when they're ready to be harvested, right, which would make it a lot more money for the farmers who are growing that stuff. It's pretty pretty awesome. And then as we kind of evolve further and further along in our technology UM and we finally reach the capability of nanotechnology, one of the things that they are hoping that nanobots, which are currently just hypothetical robots on the scale of UM like a strand of DNA or an atom or something, they'll be able to manipulate matter about UM like on that scale. So what they're hoping for is UM with agriculture, nanobots will eventually be able to deliver nutrients directly to the roots of a plant, like right when it needs it, not not from some humans saying like, hey, nanoboto, go take this nutrient, this little bit of nitrogen over to that plant right there. It will be all of this stuff will be guided and directed by computers that are paying attention to the plants through sensors and then directing the nanobots to go take this nutrient to this particular plant because it needs it right now. And this kind of this kind of attention. This tailored to individualize attention is what's called precision farming, and that seems to be something that's looming on the horizon that will be a big part of for for period. Oh yeah, I think the NANO is like serious future farming when we get to that point, But a lot of this stuff is on the imminent horizon. Um Nutrient waste is a really big deal and a big problem. I think about six of fertilizer that you apply to a field is lost to run off. So there's a big cost factor there that you're losing and it just rereaks havoc on water sheds that are nearby, which we talked about a little bit in the watershed episode. And fertilizer production and then transporting that where you need it is a big, big part of CEO two emissions. I think five to eleven kilograms of CEO two are admitted through the lifestyle life cycle of one keg I'm sorry, one kilogram gig tepe kega. That fertilizer man keg stand uh one kilogram of fertilizer. And once you fertilize the plant, Uh, it gets in that soil and these microbes you know, have to convert that fertilizer into something that's useful. And when it does that, it emits uh n O two or I'm sorry in two O nitrous oxide and that's number three behind CEO two and methane is a big problem gas. Right, So there's a lot to be saved by by cutting down on that six of waste fertilizer. A lot of stuff would be helped by that. And the more you can precisely tailor agriculture, UM, the less waste you're going to have. And I would say that UM for anybody who's interested in hearing how colossally wrong deploying nanobots into crop land could go, I would direct you to UM my tempart series The End of the World with Josh Clark, specifically the AI episode. It's pretty good, kind of eye opening. I think that's my favorite one. Actually. Oh, thanks Chuck. All right, so let's take a break and we'll come back and talk about big data right after this. Okay, we're back, and we're talking about Chuck big data and three period oh, which was already or is already using a lot of data. UM. We talked about the GPS guided tractors that have been around for a while. Um. They do use things like drones and satellites to get like literal big pictures of farms that can be really useful UM in determining like areas that are patchy or dry, or hey, this looks ready for harvest. But they're gonna bring light into the mix, which is something I know we've talked about before. L I D A R. When do we talk about that? I don't know. It might have been. It's used most famously for m mapping dense jungle ruins. UM. Like. I was reading about it in this book called The Lost City of the Monkey God by Douglas Preston, which I actually heard about in researching our episode on Finn Treasure, because Douglas Preston was the friend of Forest Finn, who UM vouched for having seen the treasure in person before his closet, And I was like, Oh, that book sounds pretty interesting. I went and read it, and it's really interesting. But he talks a lot about light are being used to map these these these ruins that have been overgrown by jungle that you normally would never be able to see overhead, but the light are UM is able to basically get beams of lasers through the brakes and like leaves and all that in the canopy to hit the ground below and then bounce back up. And so you get a picture of the understory too, which would come and handy big time for for crops, especially tall crops that are growing closely together, like say corn. Right, So you bundle all that together in a handy little app for Mr. Future Farmer and Mrs Future Farmer or Miss Future Farmer or a Miss Future Farmer or dr Future Farmer or future farmer, they or they the future farmers. That's that's great. I think we covered all the base. I think so. Um, So you have an app there, and machine learning becomes more intelligent, the Internet of Things kind of gets a little more robot and then you have farmers that don't have to constantly make these tiny little decisions, these micro decisions that they have to make every day about keeping their farm healthy. They can kind of rely on this AI technology to figure it out and do it for them. Uh, and I guess they can spend their time building future weapons to fight the eventual robot uprising. That's right. But I mean, like think about it, all of this stuff is just using things that are popping up in other sectors right now, machine learning, UM, sensors that are connected to the Internet of Things, and then integration of all this stuff that UM to oversee this so that the farmer doesn't have to make these decisions. And when you combine all this stuff together, you have like a farm that could be humming along UM just an absolute peak performance with minimal inputs that are delivered just at just the right time and just the right amount, with minimal waste UM, with the farmer having to make minimal decisions. And if you take this to its you know, eventual conclusion. I mean the there won't be like young farmers running and you know, huge farms. It'll be like somebody who owns the farm. But really it's like an AI that's overseeing the entire farm, communicating with everything through the Internet of Things, directing this nanobot over there, UM this let us bot over here. And then potentially is we grow as a UM an advanced society, there may just be one AI that we we rely on to run all the farms everywhere around the world and then handle distribution and all of that stuff. So I don't know, maybe that's agriculture five auto. Who knows, maybe we'll never get there. There's some people that certainly hope we that's not the direction we go. But we'll talk about them in a little bit. Yeah. Like if you're screaming right now, how awful this sounds, Well, we'll get to you later, don't worry. UM. Another part of four point oh is um trying to grow crops where it doesn't seem like you should be able to grow crops. The desert is obviously one of those places. Uh. Saludias are already investing a lot in trying to UM figure out the genomic codes or genomic genomic. I think both work. One seems British. Well it's a genome, so it's probably genomic gentemic. That's how the British had saved the genomic codes. Uh. These plants that can withstand the desert conditions and figure out how to grow stuff there. And this is kind of where we wander gently into GMOs, which I think we've have been dodging this one as a full topic for a while to do it, we should at some point because it is very controversial. It has a bad rap, some people say, rightfully, so it has a bad rap I think about Americans say they think GMOs um are safe to eat, which is, you know, pretty pretty decent minority there. Science says that they are safe to eat. But for all this sort of bluster about GMOs, they haven't really done a lot with GMOs yet, except for a couple of a few little kind of dirty, underhanded things. Well, yeah, like um creating patented um seeds that grow plants that don't produce more seeds, so farmers are forced to buy the seeds every single year. Yeah, that's a big one. There's another one that only responds or responds best to a specific brand of pesticide UM, so you have to buy that brand of pesticide, which happens to be manufactured by the same company that owns the patent on the plant. It's kind of shady stuff like that. The thing is, it's not like that's all they've tried to do. They've also tried to have breakthroughs in you know, um like plants that can withstand like horrible droughts, and they haven't been able to break through in that that sense, or plants that you know, produce double the yield with minimal inputs. They haven't had that breakthrough. That doesn't mean they're not going to break through that there won't be huge advances and plants science. But even if we do reach that point, like, there's going to have to also be like a public information campaign that basically says like this stuff will not mutate your children, it's safe to eat, it won't make you glow. And there's definitely an enormous amount of fear of science from what I can tell involved in GMOs. I haven't done the research yet, so my opinion might change when we actually do the episode, but from the minimal research I did on it, it seems like a fear of science. And as far as science is concerned, it's it's everything we know about it, it's it's safe to eat. Um. I don't know that will remain to be seen. Let me do some more research first before you quote me on that. Yeah, and I think of the bad rep too. Is just like we were talking about the couple of three uses so far that have allowed certain companies to really take advantage of the situation. Let's just yeah, it's not like giant mega corporations have you know, garnered a lot of trust from the general public over the years and in fact have squandered it pretty pretty efficiently. Actually. Uh So, seawater farming is another thing on the horizon, um, and there are a couple of iterations of that, one of which is actually using seawater to farm. And when we're not talking about spraying plants obviously, we're talking like farming shrimp things that this working. It's like idiocracy where they were using gatorade to water the plants. Um. Yeah, like growing shrimp, farming shrimp. Um. Because that protein demand that we were talking about, as as developing nations get more money and they're gonna they're gonna want more shrimp. I'll eat more shrimp. Remember when you were allergic to shrimp? Yes, And I was like, I am not going to spend the rest of my life allergic to shrimp. And you figure it out sort of right, I handled it. Um. There's a Japanese snack called shrimp chips, and they're like little fried kind of like French fries, but they're crispy um chips and they're dusted with shrimp flavoring that include shrimp. And I just kind of immunotherapy therapy or therapized myself immunize them myself to them to shrimp so that I could eat them again and it worked. You know, we should quickly thank our scallop buddy. Oh, I think that's a great idea, man, So huge, huge, huge thanks to our pal tog Braun who just hooked us up, man, I mean hooked us up with some amazing scallops. Yes, fresh ones. They have been in the in the water like the day before we got them, I believe, right. Yes, it was very fresh. And I think her boat is the downiest day boat out of main that's her company for sure. Yeah yeah, yeah, but you can you can order this stuff and like you can get the best scallops in the world sent right to your door very quickly. And boy were they good. I mean they were so fresh, dude, that the first two three, alright, seventeen scallops I ate or raw, Like I just ate them. I ate them raw. They were amazing. Yeah, it was. It's really good. So I strongly recommend them to hats off. Thanks a lot to I'm not the biggest raw scalop person, but um, there was a lot of butter and garlic involved in my scene. Yeah, and they cooked up so nicely down the perfectly. Uh so, yeah, thanks for that diversion since we were talking shellfish. But yeah, farming shrimp for seawater farming. And another is where they actually have greenhouses built that will you see water that evaporate uh, the salt out of it into fresh water. They can sell that salt, which is great and then have that great delicious fresh water to irrigate their crops. Right, and then um land uses a big problem to people are like running out of lane. We need it to live on and do other stuff on. Some people have said, well how about this, we'll just grow stuff indoors vertically rather than outdoors horizontally. I actually have a friend who's engaged in this endeavor up in Jersey. He broke his teeth, my friend Matt Um. He broke his teeth, not literally, but he gained experience working on space lettuce for NASA. UM. Like he's right, that's that's right. I was like, it doesn't sound right. He cut his teeth. UM, and he's an expert in UM like the like light spectrums, like artificial light spectrums to grow plants in space. It's pretty awesome. Yeah, it's amazing. Yes, So hey, Matt, should we take another break and then talk about the other other side of the coin. Here, hold on, let me think, yes, we'll be right back, all right. So if we were talking about all the benefits of consolidation of farms, bigger farms, automation of farms, future farming, there is another group of people that have been screaming for years. We don't want to go that way. We should go back to to the neat not know within necessary, but we should go back to one period, oh and practice agro ecology. Uh. And that's what I was that documentary I saw about the biggest little farm. These people that moved from l a too very impossibly or I guess, and probably start their own farm where everything lives in harmony. There's livestock, and there's wild animals, and there's pests that they say are beneficial that they let live. And they really have tried to figure out this idea that you know, you can have a small farm that feeds people locally with giving people fresh food and not transporting it halfway across the country or the world. And that is the way forward, not what we're heading towards with four point Oh. Yeah. People who are proponents of agrocology are looking at the other proposals for for for auto and they're like, you're talking about genetically modifying plants so you can grow them in the desert. Do you really not see that? We've like we've really lost our way here, like let's figure out something else. And they're saying like, look, you know, we've really tried to UM. We tried this green revolution, which basically the a good definition I saw for the green revolution is where you take UM ecosystem services, which is like natural pest control, like predatory insects or the natural nutrient cycle UM, and you you manipulate them. You you you create an artificial version of it that you can control a lot more easily, and you use the heck out of it to grow the heck out of some plants. That's the green revolution there, Like we tried this, it worked for a little while, but now we know for sure that it is really harmful to the environment, so we need to dial that back, not double down on it. And that's UM. That's kind of that. That's where this there's a tension. Now there's this split, there's a we've reached a fork in the road, and we're like, which way do we go. Do we just really keep hammering this traditional farming because we know that we can coax um enough food to feed some people or ten billion people, or do we say no, we actually need to go the agro ecology route because we have to take into account basically just as much as our ability to feed ten billion people, UM, the idea that we're not harming the earth with our agricultural practices. That's the split that we're looking at right now while we're trying to figure out what four datto is going to be. Yeah, and it seems like and Emily is way way into this stuff with agroecology for years now, and it seems like it's really all about the soil and the devastating effects on the actual soil that UM, I guess the green Revolution has has caused by all that manipulation. And she has made an effort just in our little backyard over the past, like whatever, how long we've been here fourteen years to reclaim that soil and to make it good soil again. And we've got great soil now. And it's uh, it takes a long time because so much damage has done over so many years. It's not the kind of thing where you can just be like, all right, we're gonna stop doing that, and then the soil is gonna be great again. Right. Um. It takes many, many years of really caring for that soil to get it back where it began or as close to it as possible. Yeah, and in some cases too, when you're talking about what conventional and agriculture does to the soil as far as like crop production is concerned, it's never going to get okay again. It's never going to come back. And so there's a process in conventional agriculture where you use up a plot of land and you move on to the next one, and when you run out of land, you bring more crop land online into the food production sector. And that's what you do. You you use up land until you have to replace it by taking over more land. That's the current iteration. Agro ecologies like you don't have to do that if you just treat the soil like Emily. This is their motto, Um, you where it's going to be all good like you. You you don't have to keep replacing land with more land because you don't use up the land. You actually leave the land better off than it was before you started. Using it. That to me is thing that just makes my eyes pop open and my heart just swell for I grow a college. He's like, you're actually improving the land. And there have been studies. I ran across a study of a place called um white Oak Pastures down in how I can't remember where it is. It's like south central Georgia, not too far from albany Um. And they have actually they they've hired independent researchers to come in and look at the environmental impact of what they do, which is regenerative grazing. And the study turned up findings that literally made international news. That's how eye opening that what they found was. Yes, so just a little backstory, reginatry Man, I knew I was going to do that. Regenerative grazing is a very simple premise. Basically, don't let your livestock eat all the grass down to the nub where it will probably die, and then just move them on to another area to do the same thing. Um, move them more often, they won't eat down to the nubs. Those plants and those grasses will grow back even better probably, and you'll have you know, you, like you said, you won't be using up the land. So this study they looked at they wanted to compare like the c O two costs of industrial beef production, which is something that we've talked about before, but traditional grazing emits and this is just astounding and awful. Amidst thirty three pounds of c O two to raise a single pound of meat. Uh, it's nuts. So you go to plant based meat, um like a like a beyond situation, right, which I still haven't tried. I want to try that. There's a good, impossible and beyond all right, So these meat alternatives made from plants, they really reduce that to about three to three and a half to four pounds of c O two first a single pound. But at the kok that's good, you're on the right track. But white oak is actually sequestering CEO two. It's amazing. Yeah. So if meat alternatives emit about three and a half kilograms or three and a half pounds of CEO two per pound of meat alternative, white Oak pastors is raising beef like like actual beef. And when they do, they are sinking sequestering three point five pounds of c O two for every pound of beef that's produced. There's like having solar power and creating more energy than you use exactly. Yeah, it's insane. These findings where and they've been like looked at and studied and looked at again, and everybody's like, this can't make sense. Apparently some of the UM meat alternative companies out there were like, you know, this is all wrong, this can't be right. And they were like, it's actually right. Regenator and regenerative grazing produces livestock that actually capture carbon and store it. It's insane. What are you doing. We're just moving the cows a little more. Yeah, that's basically it. And then they move them to another meadow and and like when it's belly high, and then they do it again. And like here's the thing. The reason that everybody is not doing this already is because it's way more expensive to regenera regeneratively graze. UM. If you look at white Oak Pastures, you can order their stuff online. Um, it's very expensive. It's not ridiculously expensive. Like there's definitely like um long established mail order beef companies that are three or four times of the price. You know what I mean. It does sound gross, but mail order beef. But it's some of those companies are way more expensive, but it's still more than you're going to go pay if you just go to the grocery store and get whatever beef they have. But in buying that, if you can afford it, you're actually helping to save the earth. Um, it's it's pretty impressive stuff. Well yeah, and that also helps solve the issue if you need to feed uh, however, nine billion people but in the next you know, thirty years. One of the big issues is like do we even have enough land to do that? Like, well, yeah, dummies, we might if we don't just use up land and move on to new land. Because that's a big critics criticism of regenerative grazing is it requires two point five times the land that conventional grazing does, which is why it's so much more expensive. But yeah, if if if you're not using up the land and having to bring more land in his crop land, then that issue might not actually exist. That might not be a problem, right, Yeah, pretty impressive, super impressive. I think the last thing here as far as future farming goes as we need to hit on food waste, which is I mean, if they could, if they could reduce food waste by thirty that would be a game changer for feeding the world. I think right now, it takes a land mass larger than China to grow food that goes uneaten ultimately une eaten. The size of China, it's like it's hard to even talk about without getting like super upset. So food waste also needs to be an episode that we have to do because it is just so mind boggling. But from what I saw, up to fifty of the food that America produces is thrown away, or if that Americans buy maybe I'm not quite sure, but in America about thirty in the world overall, a ton of water is wasted. I saw as much as um. A quarter of the world's water is wasted through this wasted food our fresh water intake um. And if you can just dial back a significant portion of that food waste um, not only are you gonna save a lot of money and a lot of environmental harm, you're gonna feed a lot of people. Because it's like you said earlier, our foods, food supply or food chain is globally interconnected. So we make enough food already for a lot of people, probably everybody. It's just some people go hungry because we waste so much food and we're terrible at distributing it equitably. If we can figure that out, we may not have a problem at all. And it's possible that agro um ecological farming could supply food for ten billion people. That's a big one. There's studies underway right now to figure out just what kind of gap we're talking about between uh say, organic or agro ecological crop yields and conventional crop yields. And for a long time where he's like, yeah, you just get way more food from conventional farming, and some people are actually doing the studies and they're finding like, yeah, that's true in some cases, not true in other cases. And if we can quantify exactly what the gap is, we can figure out how to close that gap. And then yeah, we can just use agro ecology. Yeah, and I think this, you know, the fork in the road where we are hopefully what it will look like. It's not a hard left turn or a hard right turn, but maybe a gentle turn on both sides that eventually come back together down the road where there's a mix of both, where there is precision farming um used in agroecology because they're not. I mean, I suppose there are some really back to basics agro uh ecological farmers that, you know, I want to have an oxen pulling a plow the Amish. Yeah, probably just them. The point is they're they're into it, man. I mean, they don't mind the idea of a robot and in precision weeding and stuff like that. Uh, it's it's these massive farms and all this waste is what they're trying to combat. So hopefully they can there can be a marriage and that can be the best way forward. Yeah, that's what I'm hoping to Pretty cool stuff, man, who knew? Great? I love it, um and we got two episode ideas out of it. So there you go. Uh, if you want to know more about the future of farming, to start reading a if. There's a lot of really interesting stuff out there. And since I said that, it's time for a listener mail. This is kind of fitting. Actually this is about hydrology. Hey, guys, have a PhD in hydrology and teach hydrology and water resources at a university. One of the misconceptions I'm constantly battling and my courses is that water is a renewable resource, which is something we said in the episode on hydro power, because it's only renewable if we use it as such. I often use the money analogies to teach this point to my students. Imagine your load your local hydrologic water balance is like having a rather large inheritance, and you are unable to ever work again or make money. As long as you live off the interest, you and your family can live forever without ever working. But if you spend the principle, you'll eventually run out of money. It's the same with water. If you only use the renewable water, you won't have an issue, as Josh noted, But if you lower lake levels, deplete ground water and melt ice caps, you will eventually run out of renewable water. You might ask, but it'll just rain again, right, And that's true, but not enough to refill the pot or the interest to refill the bank account. The money isn't gone, it's just in someone else's pocket. Similarly, the water isn't gone, it's just in someone else's watershed. Were most likely the salty oceans which we can't drink uh. That is Dr Pete Whittington, Associate professor at Brandon University, Dr Pete. Dr Pete. Dr Pete sounds like one of those people who still continue to insist that climate change is real even though it's cold outside. You know, right, smart, Well, thanks a lot, Dr Pete. We appreciate being set straight. Thank you. Um, and that is an excellent point. Um. Yeah, I don't I didn't mean to get across this idea that you know, just there's water. If we're wearing, we don't need to worry about water. No, I think you got it mostly right, he said. Good. I love hearing that. So. Um, you got anything else from Dr Pete? Nothing else? Okay?
