Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to stuff you should know from how Stuff works dot Com. You've heard the rumors before, perhaps, and whispers written between the lines of the textbooks. Conspiracies, paranormal events, all those things that disappear from the official explanations. Tune in and learn more of this stuff they don't want you to know in this video podcast from how stuff works dot Com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as the lovely and esteem of Charles W. Chucker Bryant. Are you going, buddy right? Are you slightly under the weather? I see Ted? Yeah. Everyone send other well wishes things. You'll be well by the time it's can tell them, probably, but it'll still warm my heart to see well wish exactly. Chuck. I don't know if you've got the email, but we've been asked to mention a couple of shows that are coming out companion shows. They're coming out on the Science Channel, um, The Road to punkin Chunking and punkin Chunking Itself Naturally. Yeah, yeah, and that Josh is uh, Thanksgiving night if you're board after your turkey on the Science Channel eight Eastern time, right, So can we get back to it? Yeah, let's do it, great, Chuck, Josh, do you remember coming into that delivery room from the womb with your mom going and you all wet and nasty and cold all of a sudden and everything's bright and there's people spanking you and you're suddenly a little perturbed. I remember being perturbed. That sounds like last Friday night for me. I'm not talking about any goat being around show. I don't remember that, do why? I'm totally full of it? And apparently no one members this. Being born is impossible as far as we know. As far as we know. Um so, anytime you hear somebody describing how they remember being born, you can punch them in the stomach and call them a liar. Do people say that I've heard it before. Yeah, it's rare, but yeah, people do say that they have uncovered that memory. What through primal therapy? Or are we getting there? You've got a little foreshadowing binge. That's literally like the last thing we're probably gonna cover and every end. Well, let's talk about this, Chuck, Why can't you remember being born, especially because there they think that infants are able to form memories, So why wouldn't we be able to be formed? And what's going on here? Like, that's just weird that our brains wouldn't start forming memories until a certain age after we're born. What's up with that? Why don't we remember being in the womb or sitting on a cloud waiting to come down into your mom's tummy, or you know, being like uh lay ocean gunman or something before you got to the cloud that why don't we remember any of that? Well, we can get to that in one second, but we should go ahead and just say historically that for many, many, many years, like a hundred years, they thought that we just simply our little baby brains weren't formed enough to uh, to be able to make these memories happen. Which it's a legitimate theory. Yeah, I don't think they looked into it that much though, But I mean, we develop at a certain pace, like we don't even have knee caps for the first several months, two years. Maybe, yeah, you don't have knee caps, pal, I don't think I knew that. That's why baby legs are so weird looking. You just want to chew on them, right yea um, but yeah, so we developed like we don't. We don't come out of the womb fully grown, so you can. It's not the most bone head. It's not spontaneous regeneration theory. No, but they didn't. For about a hundred years, they didn't even look into it much, I don't think. And then for the past twenty years they've started to well, hold on, what is it called? Are you talking about childhood amnesia? I am previously known as infantile amnesia by your favorite Mr Sigmund Fruid. Oh and guess what, what a surprise? He said that I had to do with repressed sexual urges. Holy cow, I can't believe it. Freud equated something with sex everything sex sex, sex. It's crazy. Sure, he said that we What we did was we repressed our memories of traumatic often sexual urgings, and formed screen memories to uh, to block the unconscious. I'd right, And by screen memories, no memories is another way to put that, because most people apparently can't come up with a concrete memory from their childhood until they turned about age three, right, But when you that's as far back as most people can remember it. Yeah, I can remember back that far. My first memory was in my first house that we moved from when I was three, and I remember very specifically a couple of things. I remember my mom wrapping her wedding ring on the back window when it was time to come in and eat. And I remember right before we moved out, we were eating on the floor that was you know, the furniture was was gone, and the next door neighbor, Billy Bright, came up to our screen door and like stood in the doorway and just watched us eat. And I remember that and I was three. What about you my earliest memory, Um, I must have been pretty young because I was still wearing diapers. Definitely less than I was younger than seven. Um. And I was banging goodbye on a storm window a storm door. Uh. And my older sister Karen was babysitting me and my mom was leaving this how I used to say goodbye so I couldn't talk. So it's definitely younger than six. Um. And I was banging on the storm window and just put my arm right through it. And I remember that scene. Um, but that's that's my no one. Do you remember that where you cut and wounded. I was. I don't remember paying or anything like that, but I was definitely bleeding everywhere. I remember my sister Karen just screaming, bloody murder. She was so freaked out. I love that you were mannish enough at that age to put your arm through a storm. I was like, it's nothing, don't worry about it, Karen, it's not a Josh door. Yeah, and then I went and started a fire. Good for you. So, um, that's my earliest memory. Um. But again, it's like it's sporadic. I can't really I can't tell you what agent it took place at well, either aside from knowing that I lived in that house and I moved it three. One of the things that um, I I recognize that as a very concrete memory, though, is that there's no photos of it. Apparently, if you look through family photos, it's very easy to generate false memories, okay, um or you know, obviously you can support the memories that you do have, as vague as they are, by looking at family photos, but these serve as cues. There were no photos of this one, and I was wearing diapers, So to me, this constitute is my release We'll get to the cues as well in a minute. But what they did figure out in the past twenty years from doing a lot of studying is that they've determined that children as young as three months old can't actually form memories. It's just the fact that these memories don't stick around as long term, right. And even more than that, they've also determined that we're born with UM, the ability to form unconscious memories. Talk about that. That's pretty cool. Okay, So basically we have two kinds of memory. We have UM, uh, explicit memory. Right. Do you remember when we talked about dogs perceiving time? We touched on this then too, we talked about explicit memory or UM semantic No, I'm sorry, we talked about explicit memory, right, or episodic memory is the name of it. UM. And then there's the other kind, the unconscious memories UM, which are referred to as semantic. So you remember when I asked you and how do dogs perceived time? Um? You know what you had for breakfast and you were describing it in detail, which lent itself to have It was evidential that that was an episodic memory, like you clearly had memories and with a semantic memory. That's where you learn how to play a piano. Uh, And you might not remember learning to play the piano, but you can remember how to play the piano because you've learned it. You're accessing a different kind of memory, right. And oddly enough, if you like lose your memory and an accident or something and anesia, you may be able to still remember how to play the piano. I find this stuff absolutely fascinating. Okay, So for unconscious memory, um, we're born with that, but it take it does take uh several months, if not years to start to develop episodic memory. Right, So how does episodic memory work? Well? Is that what are you talking about? Encoding? Yeah? Okay, Well the brain obviously, to create a memory, you need to create a synapse, which is just a connection firing within your brain between two neurons. And uh, what happens is when you, when you have a memory, encode that memory that sensory information into your memory bank, and then from there your brain categorizes it kind of files it away like you would on your computer, and then weird to think think about this, chuck, There are a series of brain cells in your brain right now, just a few that that are connected via synapsis that are responsible for maintaining your memory of the scent of a guardinia. How mind boggling is that my brain is melting? Okay, So when you think of the scent of a gardenia, you can come up with it, right, You can kind of remember what it's like right now that I'm right there. Apparently, when you smell a guardinia over and over, um, you can pick up more elements of that smell, right exactly, and you can add to that memory more and more and more. That makes right. But also the more that you think about the scent of a guardinia, the more that you recall it, the stronger that memory gets. Right. Uh yeah, I would think so yeah, kind of like a chef with their palette. So yeah, right. But I mean it's like if you train yourself to think of something or you think is something a lot, naturally your memories of it become stronger because that neural connection through the synapsies becomes stronger, biochemically stronger. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Like when I think of milk steak, I can recall that scent because I think about it on a daily basis. I don't know what that is. But that's like the second time this week I've heard that what is milk steak? Well, it was from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia last week. Okay, so what was that? The milk steak is a real thing. I think it's a steak that's literally boiled in milk. And I get the impression there's some old school like from the two. But it was very funny obviously on that show for Charlie to say it's his favorite food. Anyway, Uh so where were we? Memory? Once your brain has filed those things away, if you want to recall that memory after it's consolidated, you need to retrieve these files like you would on your computer again, same way and um, well not the same way, but the same same theory and uh. In order to do this, your brain literally retraces those original synapsis that led to the memory in the first place. So it pulls up all that information for you. I've read another article on memory formation and that process was compared to, um, wearing a path through the woods. Right you go through the first time, you might it might consist of like some broken ferns or branches or something like this. You can kind of find your way. But over the course of months or years, the more you use it, the more visible it is, the more easily accessible it is. That make like forging a trail. Oh cool, Yeah, alright, So what we're talking about encoding Because of the original held belief that babies could not encode, they thought, all right, well, maybe they have this memory, but they can't encode it. Uh not true. So it says a study with the mobile, the little babies in the mobile in the ribbon, they're little needless baby. They took these little chubby baby legs and they were talking two and three month olds, and they tied ribbon to Uh. I guess jute rope would have been cruel to pull tender baby legs just so it with like a rusty needle in twine. Yeah. So they take ribbon and they tied to the baby's legs and then tied to a mobile above their head. And they found that a baby learned that by kicking their legs they would make the mobile move, which made the babies coup and perr I would imagine, But I thought babies always kicked their legs, So I kind of wondered about this that one I found that same. I had that same idea myself, because later on when they placed the same babies under a mobile, uh, they would start kicking their legs like they wanted to make it move with the with the ribbon, although the ribbon was no longer attached, and they took from that they remembered that if you're under a mobile, kick your legs. Maybe they were saying, I don't have knee gaps, maybe kicking their legs around. Yeah, but that that actually raises a really excellent point, like, I'm pretty sure any evidence that you can come up with, it's like trying to determine whether or not animals are happy. We uh, we express our world views, our emotions, everything verbally or or through written language. But it's through language. So before while we're pre verbal, um, everything is up in the air. We it's it's almost impossible to come up with definitive evidence of anything that surrounds That's actually that's a good setup for later two with the verbal But that's just a tease. Uh. Just to close on that study, though, they found that six month old babies actually picked up that relationship between kicking legs and the mobile moving faster. So this is what led them to think that babies actually gradually accelerate that instead of oh, we have no memory, and all of a sudden, it's my third birthday and now I do have memory. So it's a gradual thing instead of a sudden rapid growth. And there's another type of memory called implicit memory, right, yes, is that this is um. This is we're born with this, but it's also different from uh our ability to form unconscious memories. It's controlled by the um cerebellum um. And basically this is like our ability to remember that, oh, yeah, we are hungry and we need to eat um, or you know, we need to seek out the our mother's warmth or something like that. Sure, like I hear her voice and I know that means that the milk is coming soon. So that that but that also sticks with us throughout our entire lives, so we don't necessarily forget that, right right, So I mean you don't ever forget like, oh I'm hungry, I need to eat, or you know, I would like to be warm right now? Right? That usually helps me survive. UM, But we're not. That's not centered around necessarily is a specific event in time. We've yet to figure out how to put things in the context of a timeline, which apparently is where real explicit memory begins, right, and that's when you need the cues. And that's what we've kind of figured out, not we, of course, but that's what they have figured out. Is the death between the babies and the adults is they cannot pick up on the cues from their past. And one of them that you were talking about was speech verbalization. Right, so we we apparently not only do we use uh language to express ourselves our thoughts or views or opinions or emotions even um, we also apparently four memories using language, autobiographical memories. Right. There was this really interesting study that um is in this article, which by the way, is called kind of Person Remember Being Born? It's on the site. It was written by the esteemed and um now famous Christen Congery of Steph Mom Never Told You and Uh. It's a very dense article. I gotta say, there was not much fluff in here, right, no chuck chuck usually highlights like the most important ones. I'm looking at this article right now. The entire article is yellow yellow. It's a article. Um So this study it was a two thousand four study um, and it found that um. It was a study of twenty seven and thirty nine month old boys and girls, and it found that if children didn't know the words to describe an event when it happened, uh, they couldn't describe it later after learning the appropriate words. That is awesome? Isn't it very cool? So apparently our language development and memory formation are very closely tied. And as you'll notice, that was a two thousand four study. We're just starting to crack um the the mystery of childhood amnesia, right right, you know, I got another one for you to, let's hear it. In relation to memory, context has a lot to do with it. And what they found in another study was that preschool aged kids can explain sequential order. But sequential order is not the same thing as a timeline of your life. Right, So if you if you're taken to a circus, you might remember, first the clown came out, and then the bear attacked the trainer and that kind of thing, but it's not like this happened two days before I started reading the Ramona Quimby series something like that, and that like you like, like I was saying that timeline is what forms our life or else we just have a cluster of like weird memories of like bears attacking trainers and you know, one chapter of a Ramona Quimby book or setting something on fire, And how can you if our lives are nothing but a string of memories and hopes for the future, what kind of life is that if we don't have a timeline to fit it? On good point, that's how we develop our sense of self absolutely and what was there was another cool stating here about how it ties to self recognition and your ability to recognize yourself as yourself. And they say that they don't think babies have this skill and they cannot basically don't have a personal identity until they're about two years old. Not only that, they have no um sense of um concreteness of the world around them. So I can't remember what age it's it's a very young age that they start to develop this. But say within the first two months, when you're sitting there cooing over a baby and you leave their field of vision, you're gone. You don't exist any longer, and you never did. Well, that's sad, isn't it. So Luckily that goes away very quickly because I mean, again, what kind of way is that to live? Don't tell the mom's that isn't that odd? Like you don't exist when you're not in their field of vision? Yeah? Are this kind of comforting? Almost in a way too. I guess when you thump them and run away, they're just like I wish I could be forgotten instantly by many people I meet. It's nice, um. And what about the cultural aspect of this? I found this interesting as well, step boy. Yeah, they found that, uh, and this isn't surprising for some reason, but they found in relation to memory that Westerners personal memories focus more on themselves, whereas Easterners remember themselves as part of a group scenario. Isn't that yes, because we're selfish, selfish Westerners. And the other cool thing too about the parents. They said that parents can and this is really good for parents to know. Actually, the more that you describe things to your children as they're growing up, the better they're going to not only be able to recall that, but be able to describe their own experiences later in life. The more detailed you get with your recounting, Like, you know, remember we went to the zoo yesterday and you saw the bear that had the the bow tie on, and then the guy through the peanut atom and where should I go from here? So the more detailed you are with with going over these things with your kid every day, than the more they're gonna be better off later on in life and stuck you're gonna like this little outside research. Um, I read a study, or I read an article, honest study I should admit um of fifteen months old that shows that sporadic napping actually helps us form the memories needed to learn languages. Yeah, so they used made up language that they taught to these kids, esperanto, not quite um. It was like just babble, but it did have UM patterns in it, recognizable patterns UM. And they found that kids who nap more often were able to pick up this language or retain memories of how to speak this language better than kids who didn't nap. His offen. You know, I think that ties into something we said a long time ago about the brain during sleep using that time to file file everything away. That maybe, and that's what dreams are too, That they're misfiles. Dude. Yeah, we're just covering everything that's covered in the past. So the whole circle, buddy, And yeah, we're good like that, aren't we. We should we talk about how toothpaste and orange juice don't mix. That's a classic. UM I guess that's it, right, I'm done. If you want to learn more about
