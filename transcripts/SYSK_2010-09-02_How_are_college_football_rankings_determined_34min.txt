Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you Should Know? From House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant that makes the Stuff you Should Know the College Football edition. Yes, our first sportscast. Ever, I think we've never done it, dude, really yeah, because I've always kind of wanted to, but then I thought we'd be, you know, excluding anyone who's not a sports fan. But we get a lot of sports fans who say you should do this. Uh, well, we'll throw them a bone here. It seems like we need some sort of heraldry like do do do do you? I could keep going. I wanted to sing final Count. I was literally like stopping myself. Well, now we have to pay a royalty since you name that tune. Buddy. Oh, before we get started, let's plug fest our college tour. Yeah, we're gonna do uh it's not exactly college tour, but it is just oh yeah, that's a trivia tour. It was. It's a national tour. But there's colleges in these places where we're going. Yeah, we're going to do um anywhere between five and seven cities, winding up in Austin as far as I know. Yeah. Um, And we're kicking it off October, which is the Wednesday in Atlanta, g A, which is just down the street. We're actually in it right now. Some would argue we kicked it off in New York. Yeah, you could definitely make that case. So New York brought the goods. Yeah, I wonder if Atlanta will bring goods similar to New York. And and I'm talking to you toub Birmingham and uh, Chattanooga, Well definitely. And what else is close? Um, Charlotte's not too far off Asheville's three hours. Ashville's got no excuse, and we're not coming to Ashville. So this is your chance. Well that's the beauty about the Southeast. Just go to Atlanta and everybody drives. You just know you have to drive if you're in the Nobody from Florida is welcome though, you'll be turned away at the door. Um. So yeah, that's going to be October, which is a Wednesday. I'm almost positive it's going to be at Five Seasons Brewery Brewing Company. Yeah. On the west Side. Um so up on the roof. Yeah awesome. We'll be throwing more details up on Twitter and our Facebook fan page stuff you should know. And our Twitter feed is s Y s K podcast in case you want to follow us, Um and Chuck. I guess it's time we should get to football rankings, right, yeah, this one. Uh, we should just go ahead and say that the article for this one on our website is a little out of date. And college football and the BCS is ever changing, so I kind of expected that it wouldn't be, you know, really up to date. It's changed a lot over the past six years. It's changed a lot over the past six minutes. Actually, you know, Um, yeah, it's might you know, we're gonna do our best here. Uh. Not only that, if you thought the Quantum Suicide podcast was hard to follow, Buddy, get a pen and piece of paper out right now, because there's gonna be some detailed equations and afterward there will be a quiz. Chuck. I tend normally to lean more towards UM A p the Associated Press over USA today for accuracy and reporting, right, but I looked at the n c a A Football rankings today preseason, uh, and I saw that USA Today has Georgia ranked twenty one, whereas A P has Georgia ranked twenty three. So I'm leaning towards USA Today's reporting. Today they both have tech ring hired to Yeah, it doesn't matter. Let Tech get the number one spot and then come Thanksgiving will knock them out of it. It's one of the great joys in my life when we have a terrible season, but we may have a good season. It remains to be seen. I can't say anything. I don't even know who are starting quarterback is going to be? Is that Aaron Murray? It's Aaron Murray and Murray Murray. It's like try to now, I wonder where she'd been. I think she's been in the same place for several years. No, she did, I think, so we should probably look that up there too, Anne Murray, if you're not dead, we apologize. We've greatly exaggerated your so chuck before the BCS, right, there was a streat line in a John Travolta movie, and I can't believe these words are coming out of my mouth. But why you sweet? That's that's my impression. No, the um that movie was Michael. I think it was where he played like a kind of down to earth angel who like drugs and boozing and womenizing. You saw it, okay, so it was like kind of a cute movie. But there was one thing that he said that I've always thought was very clever was that he told somebody in that movie that he invented lines. And before then people were just standing around, like bumping into each other and didn't know what to do. So I kind of have the same impression of college football season and their end pre BCS. Everybody's kind of bumping into everybody else. There was a distinct possibility that you had a number of teams claiming the number one spot in no way to resolve that. And you know, we humans are very much into saying you are clearly number one. And the BCS, while it had a rockie start at first, has kind of fulfilled that spot. Right It's got a pretty good UM record the last six or ten years, right well, according to the BCS and ESPN, Yeah, well we might as well go ahead and say, um. The BCS claims that in the twelve years since it's been around, there twelve or twelve according to their formulas, and there nine for twelve according to like coaches polls as far as matching up the two best teams to play for the national title. And previous to that, like you said, for decades, teams played each other in bowl games and then sports writers voted on a national champion, which is kind of made up. It's beyond ridiculous. If you think the BCS predict, let's that's even more ridiculous. Yeah, and um, well, let's talk about how the BCS is calculated. Right, Well, what are what are the BCS. There's five games before there were twenty five bowl games? Is that correct? Uh, they're twenty nine games aside from the BCS games before. Now now there's twenty nine excluding the BCS games. Okay, but before I understand that they were like twenty five bowl games and they were all important because there was no BCS. Well important to varying degrees, right, But it's almost like playing musical chairs with eight kids, but with nine chairs, you know. So, Um, the BCS comes in and says, hey, we're going to make sure the clear winners established, and we're going to do so by establishing that we're gonna say these Bowl games are actually the important ones, right, and they are what they are, the Sugar Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl, and they all have different sponsors that kind of change, and we're not paid by any of them, so we're not going to mention. Huh. Well, three of the four of these in this article are wrong. That's how much they've changed. You know. I think Tostitos is the only one that's still actively sponsoring the Fiesta Bowl and the There's big money involved in these things, right, There's payouts that go directly to the schools involved and then also to their conferences. Right, Yeah, should we break that down? Let's do it? How that works? Uh? Last year, the payout for the National title game was seventeen million dollars per team, so thirty what is that for? Thirty four million bucks? But the team doesn't get all of that, It is split. You get a participation fee, and then after the participation participation fee is taken out, the rest of the money is split among all the teams in the conference. So the SEC is loaded with talent. They send let's say eight teams to bowls. So that's a lot of money coming to schools like Vanderbilt in Kentucky that may not go to of all, so they love it. I think I probably already know the answer to this, right, But are you one of those people who when George is not in a game, you still root for the SEC. I root for all SEC teams except for Florida, thank you, and uh boy, Tennessee is tough for me to get behind. Trouble rooting for Tennessee as well. But if it was like Tennessee versus USC, I would certainly root for Tennessee. But I can never root for Florida no matter what happens. Now, I can't either, Chuck, and I'm glad to hear you say that. I also have trouble rooting for Tech. Some people are like, well, it's a Georgia team, so if George is not playing, then I root for Tech, And I'm like, you're a communist at don't root for Tech. They're sort of neutral. Like I root for their basketball team because I liked them back in the day, but not not for football. And my brother works there, so I gotta keep it on the you know, up and up. That's very nice of you keep it in the family. So, Chuck, what should we talk about next? Well, the BCS is um is not a body. It's an event which consists of these football games, and it's managed by the UM Bowl, the BCS, subdivision conferences and these are the big boys, right, But don't you get the And I was surprised to hear this. There's an ESPN article that you sent me giving it background background of the BCS, and it said, like two nine pole showed se of n c a a coach's favor keeping the BCS in place over a playoff. Right. That kind of flies in the face of information that I've had, like anecdotally, you know, I mean, I know, I've never asked Mark Rick, you know, on the spot, but I get the impression that there's a lot more people that want playoffs than don't, definitely, and that the BCS is something of an entity and it's not just you know, this this panel that's you know, created by this democracy, that it's more like an iron fist and if you don't like it, they'll you'll be c Is that not the case? How well? They say they're not entity, but I bet they have an office. I bet they kind bet people work there, and I bet there's just iron desks for their iron fists. I should know, though, I did say that the BCS conferences were who make up this this body. We also have to include Notre Dame in there because you actually get to vote, although you don't include Notre Dame as much as you used to. No, I mean they're still in there though. They get their participation included UM as an independent, as does Army and Navy, which is interesting too. Yeah, a Notre Dame gets three votes in Army and Navy get one each. Right, Well, that's votes for UM. Those are nominations for the Harris Interactive Football Poll. This is going to be all over the place. It is, but it's okay, we're making sense so far. I mean, the BCS came around in ninety eight. It established that there's five bowls. We sent the bowls, right, Well, yeah, but four plus the national title game? Right, And it's not just like, okay, here's the rankings and then the season's over, so one versus to you go play two versus three, ugo play three versus or four versus five. It doesn't happen like that. But that's kind of counterintuitive until you realize that the BCS algorithm is the most complex algorithm ever created by man and it's actually composed of a number of different algorithms spitting out numbers and then those numbers are factored in. So I think, Chuck, we put it off long enough and we can't any longer. Let's talk mathematics and statistics. Okay, yes, Uh, you're gonna have to explain some of this, but um, because math is not my strong talk about the subjective pulse. How about that I was told there would be no math. I'll try to handle the math as best as possible, but it's gonna be like that one kind of breathalyzer that I thought I understood. Well, Uh, things have changed, Josh. Since it was originally the BCS was set up a certain way, and then in two thousand and two and two thousand four a lot of changes took place. It used to be UM four fact jurors that weighed into the BCS ranking, and now there are only three factors. The A P I'm sorry, the USA today A Coaches poll. Right. The AP pole was replaced um before the two thousand four season, I think by the Harris Interactive Pole. And then the last third is a very complex computer ranking system. Uh. An average of six computer rankings are averaged and that is the last thirty three and the third percent. Right. And these UM computer rankings are basically independent groups or people who say, yeah, we're following football and we have a pretty good algorithm, and here's our contribution. UM. There used to be I think eight, and now there's six. UM. So you've got guys like Richard Billingsley, who's just a businessman I love it and apparently likes to to come up with college rankings in his spare time. Their statisticians and mathematicians, right, and businessmen and businessmen. Yeah, so weird. It is weird. Maybe his business is accounting, but UM, so they'll they'll take into account. For example, the Billingsley report uses the strength of the opponent final score UM, and the win lose records of the teams before and after the game. Right. Combine all these together and you create a numerical value. Right. Some other people or some other UM computer rankings systems like UM. Who else is There's Seattle Times, which is run by a guy named Jeff Anderson who's a political science graduate student. Was and I guess he's just a political scientist. Um. And Chris Hester, who's a sportswriter and um, these two get together and they take quality of opponent and strength of schedule. The problem is, Chuck, is you can't just go, yeah, Boise States doing pretty good, So we're gonna give them a five for strength of schedule or strength of opponent or quality of opponent, that kind of thing. Um, what they have to take into account are wide factors like let's say you win. Yeah, it's not just good enough that you're going to win. Who exactly did you beat? And how do you quantify who you beat? Well, you say where you play, right, So we have to look at yours, not only your opponent's schedule, but your opponent's opponent's schedule, and then you you put numerical values onto those, right, the win loss, and then you calculate that, and you come up with another numerical value that's called strength of schedule. And to get down to the nitty gritty, the strength of schedules calculated like this, You've got your opponent's schedule, Chuck, you play Boise State. Boise State has been doing pretty good. I'm not playing there, dude, so you won't catch me on a blue football field. You Well, well, there they came and visited you, but you beat them between the hedges. So you've got UM two times s O, and s O is your opponent's schedule. Boise States schedule, you've got two times that. Plut. They're Boise States opponents schedules, all of them calculated to wins and losses. So it's two times your opponents schedule plus Boise States opponents schedules equals strength of schedule. Okay, that's just one component in some computer rankings, and strength of schedule I think used to be a standalone component, but now it's just factored in with the rest. And they also threw out the margin of victory. That used to be a factor as well, but they could you remember that was a big deal when coaches were running up the score. Florida would try and put like sixty points on a team, you know, against like Louisiana Lafayette, and uh, they were like, you know what, that's not really too cool. That really shouldn't factor in. So that was thrown out right the scripts Howard UM poll, which I don't think is used any longer. UM used to have a penalty actually for running up the score before it was thrown out. Yeah, part of their computer ranking was if you ran up the score, you were penalized, which is good because guys like Steve Spurrier used to need to be held in check. Now he's holding himself in check. Look at you. That's good. So is that all for the computer ranking? Third or you still got something on that? No? I think I'm I'm good okay. Uh, then you have, like I said, one third is the USA today, Uh, coach's poll and that is literally coaches voting. Um, not all of them always vote. I think there's a hundred and fourteen potential votes, but there may be a hundred and six people vote one week. Remember Steve Spurrier got some criticism at one point because like he failed to vote in like some really important week a couple of years back or something like that, and he explained that he did and his assistant lost a vote or something like that. I can't remember what it was. But that is factored in as well. They still don't divide by the same number, you know, they'll they'll factor it down by the number of votes that the number of possible votes. Yes, okay, to make them more accurate. I've also heard accusations that in coaches polls, UH, specifically, they have their kids vote sometimes, like they just can't be bothered to vote, so they'll just be like fill this out for me, will you, because they know their kids watch some games or whatever. And that that's why human polls are so fallible. That a lot of coaches don't vote, and the coaches that appear to a vote haven't necessarily voted themselves, and even if they have, they're not completely informed. Because TCU horned frogs, I like frogs, that's how it ends up. Yes, well that's how TCU ended up in the top. Ever, I guess so because of Ralph Wigham UM. And then you have the Harris Interactive Poll, and that um, like I said, replaced the eight people and they ranked them each week from late September to the end of the season. And I'm sorry that has a d and fourteen participants. That was the one fourteen I was thinking of, And UM, sorry I didn't correct you, right, And they're not just coaches, they're former coaches, student athletes, administrators, some media. And that is where Notre Dame get to say, because you get to nominate who was on this committee to vote for the Interactive poll, and each conference see these where Notre Dame gets away with something. In my opinion, each conference gets ten nominations and Notre Dame gets three, Army gets one, and Navy gets one. Yeah, so like the Big twelve twelve teams get ten nominations, Notre Dame gets three all by themselves. Right, Notre Dame has always gotten some sort of weird free ride for some reason. Why we're gonna hear about it. Yeah, but it's still I mean, it's true. They they there's a lot of favoritism towards that team, and I dare anybody to prove otherwise. Well, they haven't been great recently, but they are. They still one of the most favored, one of the most legendary teams. Yes, just because Ronald Reagan played for you doesn't mean you're a great team in two thousand and ten. You know, hey, you're preaching the choir, my friend, so Chuck. When you take these things together, the Harris Interactive Poll, the Coaches poll, and the computer rankings numbers that you crunched together and created one number. That's the third or third and third, right, Um, the most you can get is one correct at one point? Oh, actually at one point oh oh. The lowest score. You're looking for a low score here, right, low score means high ranking. This is where it gets a little hinky. Sorry to steal your word, but in the article explicitly says that you want the lowest score. Right, Yes, But in this other material that we've gotten from the BCS site, it looks like the the the higher the score, the closer to a one point oh, the higher you're ranked. Here's why I say that, chuck um in. In the coach's poll, right, coaches vote from one to five and assign each team ranking in reverse order. So if you're number one, you get twenty five points. If you're in twenty five place, you get one point, Right, so you would want more points. Correct, Yeah, But here's here's where I think it gets worked out if I'm correct and understanding this. What happens is, let's take the Harris poll. For instance. You take the total score of all your votes, and you divide that by two thousand, eight hundred and fifty, which is the maximum number that anyone can receive if all one D fourteen voting members rank that same team number one. So let's say everybody ranks Alabama number one, a one fourteen that they get two thousand, eight hundred and fifty total points, they divide that by two thousand, eight hundred and fifty, and so they end up getting a one. Okay, okay, So if you got um, if you divided I guess what one? If you had a one and you divided that by two thousand, eight hundred and fifty, I see, it would be much lower, right, And the coach the coaches poll is the same thing. They just divided by fourteen seventy five because that's the maximum number. So at least I'm right in saying that the best you could possibly get from the b CS formula is a one point zero, I believe. And it kind of follows that same thing, like you have a one in anything less would be like a point nine to oh or a point eight seven three? Right, yes, okay, yeah, that's exactly right. A plus B plus C divided by three would be point right okay, okay, all right, And see this is really confusing. It's like giving birth to a watermelon, except with your head a square Japanese watermelon, which would be even worse, especially if the edges were sharp. So, ladies, when you're like, you know, if you're not into this. I'm not saying that not all ladies are into it, but whoever's not into college football, and you poo poo it, think about how complex the system is that they've worked out. It's not just a bunch of guys sitting around drinking beer smashing each other's heads in. It's very complex, right, But I mean to the guys who are sitting around smashing each other's heads in with beer being drunk around them, it's still like I'm ranked twenty three. Yeah, true, you know, Okay, so chuck, it sounds like we made it through the math part. Yeah, what else is left? Uh? Well, that's sort of it. I mean, at the end of the year, the math determines your ranking. And we should point out that the BCS ranking, which determines who plays in these BCS Bowls and National title game, that doesn't start getting ranked. They don't do like preseason rankings or even early season that starts in mid October. Right, the preseason rankings are a p in USC today. Yeah right, and all sorts of other rankings. You know, there's all kinds of people that are like the BCS can't conceivably start because the computer rankings have to take in like strength of schedule, and you can't you can't determine that until somebody has a winner a loss against them, right, Uh, unless you're ranking by last year, right, Yeah, exactly. So mid October is when the BCS rankings start to come out, and that's about halfway through the football season, so they have enough data at that point. I think that's why. Wait, so check. You used to be the n c A Football League, the conference, the whole thing was called Division one A, and now it's called the Football Bowl Subdivision programs. Whether you like it or not, Yeah, exactly. Do you feel like we should have a playoff? Uh? Oh boy. I think that they should work a playoff system into the existing system somehow, and a lot of a lot of people think that. I agree. I don't think that there should be like um wild cards or anything like that, although I think you need them mathematically, but I think that you have to still place an emphasis on the regular season, and it's possible to do that with with a playoff system as well. Yeah. That's one of the arguments against the playoff is that they some people say that it will render the regular season. BC supporters say will render the regular season not as important, And I don't understand that logic because you still have to play those games to get ranked high to get in the tournament. They're not It's not like the basketball. They're not gonna include sixty four football teams. They're gonna I mean, I've heard different proposals from like sixteen teams to like the final eight teams battle it out. Finally, eight teams would be fine with me. Anything, anything where you determine it on the football field would be fine with me, because it's the only sport that it's not determined by a bracket of some sort. One of the reasons why we may never see a playoff is that the revenue associated with bowl games has increased by like two thousand percent since the BCS was instituted. So well, I think you can still work within that system. I mean, you can still call them bowl games and everything. You could just put it in the form of a bracket. It would add games, which would add more money. Um. Another reason against it, they argue, is like risk of injury and their student athletes, so they don't want to drag it on into their academic year. But come on, it's all about the dough it's this college athletics, but everyone knows it's about the money. Um. I did read a UM I read a few arguments today, like four and against and one writer I think he was from Slate. He calculated from his calculations. Um, he thinks only sevent of n C Double A Division one eight teams even have a shot to compete for the national title by his calculation. Each year. Well, if you're not a BCS school, then you're kind of out the door to begin with, Like boise State may have a chance that they were on the table this year, but that's a rarity, so that takes you down to and then he says, uh, if you don't start the season ranked number twenty or higher, then you're almost mathematically eliminated. So that takes you down to sevent can even compete for the national title. But I also say, I mean, there's both sides to the coin there. I also say, if you're you know, I'm not gonna pick on Boisey State because they are a good football team. But let's say you're like Colorado Appalachian State who beat Michigan that what two years ago? Remember that that was awesome. They in Michigan paid them like a million dollars to come to Michigan. Michigan pound on them and that. But teams like that, I mean, I kind of don't want to hear their argument that they should be competing because they're not big boys. They're not playing in the SEC. They're not playing in uh the Big ten or the Big twelve. Yeah, but if you're not, then you'll never attract talent. You can never get there. It's a self defeating system. Yeah, So, I mean it's very exclusive and elitist. Really from the schools with the most money are the ones that get to be in it and can perpetuate that that good program, the winning program through more and more money. Yeah, yeah, you're right. I did see another guy that said that he thought they should do like um, I think it was a sixteen team pool and and the top twelve BCS schools, Like, you get your automatic if you win the SEC, you're in, If you win the Big ten, you win, if you're in the Big twelve year in. So after all your automatic bids make the rest like the last four or whatever at large bids. So you can still have the Cinderella teams in there with the possibility, and you know answered on the football field, if you can beat them, great because boys State beat Oklahoma a few years ago. Remember in that ball game. Remember the statue of liberty play. It's crazy. They pulled out a play from like the nineties. It was beautiful and one that was um I think was that to three years ago. It was like the greatest football season of all time. It was just all over the place number UM Missouri was like number one for a little while. There was like twenty different teams number one. Yeah. Yeah, it's exciting. It's like three years ago. Right, it's not very exciting. Like when you start the season number one, you run the table unless you go to that school. We should mention too though. There was one change about um geez. Just about a month ago. Uh, the BCS announced that teams that are ineligible for postseason play are removed from the computer rankings and all six of the formula was so basically this is like the USC rule. Oh yeah yeah. Because USC's on probation now, they can't play in a bowl game for the next like two years or something, and so they said, well, we can't factor them in if they are the number eight ranked team, if they can't even play in the postseason, right, But not only that, if you're not eligible. I got the impression like, once you've reached once it's statistically impossible for you to be eligible through your losses, they start taking you out of the rankings, and everybody below you goes up one rank. No, I think if you, I think that means if you're ineligible from like crime, yeah, from from being a banned from postseason play, I'm pretty sure. And as far as the code the human polls go, uh, they said earlier this summer that the polls will not include teams that are prohibited from the n t A. So they went the same route. So but by USC and there is the BCS. We could re record this in probably twenty thirty minutes, and um, it would be entirely different. Um. If you to know more about the BCS, you should probably go to BCS dot com. There's a handy search bar there, I'm sure. And just give us a little while to get this article up to snuff. Okay, yeah, we probably got something wrong here and there too. I was just I hope we talked fast enough so that where no one noticed. I have them in my head, my friend Scott Galvin, um with his arms crossed, just like shaking his head. He's in the sound booth right behind you. Actually, like I could feel it. Actually, all right, Well, thanks for listening to me and talk about college football. Um, for whatever reason you want to, you should go to house stuff works dot com. There's a handy search bar there. Make something up and type it in and it will take you to a beautiful new place. Just spell it correctly, or also won't take you anywhere. Right. Yeah, Um, that brings us. Then I guess to listener mail. Yes, Josh, this is gonna be a two parter because it's long. We heard from a prisoner about our prison email, and he gave us lots of good stuff, and I told him I was going to read it. It's an anonymous because he is a straight shooter. Now he's on the level, doing very good in his profession, a square, and nobody in his profession knows that he was arrested for dealing math, and so he wants to keep it that way. Does he work here, Yes, he does. It's Jonathan Strickland. Uh, guys. I was arrested in the mid nineties for selling an ounce of meth to an undercover narc in Nevada. I was set up by a friend who had gotten arrested on a similar charge. Decided that he would snitch rollover and uh some uh some people so they would get probation. Unfortunately, under Nevada zero tolerance policy, I had no priors. I was twenty two and I was looking at twenty five to life for my first defense. Did he include uh in there? Or was that you? That was me? To make a long story short, I jumped bail rand Oregon and lived on the lamb for three years. This is the real deal. It sounds like hippie Rob. It is not hippie Rob. He got tired of living life on the lamb, obviously, hired a lawyer, turning self in like a good guy, and managed to get the charges dropped to level two trafficking, enter to plea deal. And the long, long story short, he was in for I think three years. Uh, And I just have a couple of prison ted bits on this end, and then we'll do the next part in the next podcast. He was not in a new prison that had the cards to keep track of commissary accounts. They were given paper slips sort of like at a sushi restaurant, and we would turn them in once or twice a week. We would pick up our order in the next day or so. Items available were personal hygiene items tooth basted, deodorant, shampoo. If you could not buy your own, you could get the state issued stuff. But that stuff was absolute garbage and I should mention too. We got another email from someone that said that Bob Barker's company, just looking it up makes prison. So yeah, is that true. I'm looking it up as hopefully at the end of this you'll know, because that would be really weird. Get your pet spade and neutered, and I will make your prison soup for you. UH. Cigarettes were available, both packs of cigarettes like Cammel and Marlborough, as well as loose tobacco and rolling papers. Packs of cigarettes were called tailor's short for tailor made. They're expensive and out of reach for most inmates. UH. Financially, having Tailor's was a status symbol, and their rarity made them great bargaining chips. Interestingly, most gray market trading he reserves the term black market for contraband, where items purchased out of the commissary. Things you could get with purchased commissary items for trade were limited only by the creativity of the inmates. For example, a pack of cigarettes a week. You could pay somebody to iron your clothing for you, so you would always look as nice as possible for visits. If you wanted to write somebody a letter, you could pay one of several talented artists to custom decorate your envelope with roses or balloons or whatever else you could imagine. Basically, it was like on demand customary stationary, and it was actually a high service demand in prison. So that is the end of part one. Josh, we're gonna leave hanging for part two. So Chuck, do you want the answer about Bob bark greatly. There is a guy named Bob Barker who makes prison toiletries, but he's not Bob Barker of Crisis right according to Snopes at least. Okay, So thank you very much Chuck for part one. I myself, I'm very excited about part two, and I'm glad I don't have to wait until next Thursday to hear it. I get to hear it in about thirty forty minutes. If you want to send us an email about Bob Barker, your favorite college football team, or your mom's home cooking. We want to hear about it.
