Either way, come see us in Atlanta for our one time only Christmas special. That's right, they go and sale this Friday, so don't snooze or you will lose. Welcome to stuff you should know from house stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles w Chuck Bryant, and wait for it, there is first time ever guest producer Dylan First on first time. I confirmed it with him. He's nodding. He said, we're the only show here that he hasn't guested as a producer on. So the band has been lifted finally. I don't know if it was it was his band. They finally warmed down. But you know, he's the regular producer on Afro Punk Solution Sessions, Yes, which is pretty awesome podcast hosted by our pals Eve Jeff Cote and I didn't pronounce the s on Eves but it's Eaves and verified this and bridget Todd from stuff Mom never told you bridgets Todd. But they do um. They kind of present like you know, afro punk, like the tour, the Musical Tour, the Awesome Musical Tour. Um. They have like a side thing called Solution Sessions and it's kind of like um Ted Talks, but for um so first for significant things that get overlooked generally, so like race centric stuff, reproductive rights or things like that. It's pretty awesome. It's good and you can get it anywhere. Yeah yeah, look at that. Well we gotta pay him somehow. I was just gonna slide him my half warm sparkling water as payment. No, I've got a cold one here. Oh yeah yeah, how do you get those out of the fridge? So chuck um before we get started again. A couple other things. There are two episodes in here that I want to do separately. Okay, h a bit, I can guess them Civil Air Patrol, know what? Sure, But that wasn't one of them. Well that was one of mine. Okay, so there's three and this is a media episode. What's the other one? Then? I don't know oh, you know it scuba or we already did Scuba Cat? We did? I forgot about him. Did you interview the guy who who made Scuba Cat swim around? Yeah? And it's funny. We often mentioned Jackhammers is our worst show ever. I forgot it's Scuba Cat? Is it? You go back and listen. No, but it's got to be the worst, right, we'll have to have like a listening party. That was like not even a thing. We'll listen to Jack Hammerson Scuba Cat. It was, well, it was the thing. It was that one cat. Yeah, and I guess we can just come out and say now that Discovery Channel made us do that. That's like kind of one of the only times we were steamrolled. That's funny. Otherwise we have autonomy. I don't know if that was being steamrolled as much as Rick rolled. Well, now, I don't even know what you're gonna pick it in, all right, I'll tell you then, No more suspense for you, um Coast Guard. No, I don't feel like you know me at all anymore. I don't search and rescue dogs. Oh they're like, dude, I looked at the article. It's at least as big as this one all right, robust, and they don't have a lot of overlap. It's not like doing recycling twice or anything like that. And the other one is getting lost. Oh well, that's esoteric, right right. I didn't expect you to guess the loss time. I thought you'd get searching rescue dogs. But there's a whole psychology getting lost, and this is about finding people. I want to talk about getting lost. Sometimes it's just too much to put onto this one. So it's going to be its own episode, okay, and all your mark Civil Air Patrol because fellow network host colleague John Roderick of omnibus is or was a member of the Civil Air Patrol? Is he mary yet? No, no, no, because that'd be something like the flying Mayor of Seattle. You'd love to be the flying but even still, remember the Civil Air Patrol. It's pretty interesting. So he flies? Uh did? I don't know if he's current, but Roderick is. He has a very interesting pass. I'd be well, it's an interesting It would be kind of fun to do Civil Air Patrol and pick his brain. Okay, let's do his weird brain, alright, flying brain. So we have our two organic show plugs in. Yeah, so we're talking today about s search and rescue. I forgot I wrote this. You did write it back in like a million years ago. Yeah, that's when I was. Um. I was so excited to be the adventure writer. You wrote a bunch of adventure stuff, and I was named adventure writer. Here's the funny part of this story. I was named adventure writer. I was really excited. Then, after a while of doing this stuff before the podcast, I went into an unnamed boss I know this story and said like, hey, man, I really think that, Like I'm kind of wondering about the future here and where where I could go and if I could work my way up somehow to do things. And he he very politely, was like, I think this is kind of the deal, and like there is not much of the future here beyond writing these articles. And then that same dude would change my life tossing a podcast our way. That funny how things work out, It is hilarious. No future here, right. I think he even put a cigarette out in front of you. On my hand. It was really painful. So but a reminder. Still, but you wrote some good stuff. The survival stuff is is good. We have more to to dig through. I appreciate it. I was nervous going into when I saw this was my article from back then. I was like, oh man, this is gonna steak. But it was actually a decent article. It was It was an expansive article too. There's a lot of stuff to it because there's a lot of stuff to search and rescue. There's a lot of different kinds of search and rescue, right, I mean, you know, now I feel like the sham is up because you already know all this stuff, so I can't tell you anything. I guess I'll tell you guys who are listening to the podcast. But there's a lot of different types of search and rescue. Right. There's urban search and rescue, which happens after say like like nine eleven. Yep. I've also seen it us and are really yeah, it's a little it is um. There's like marine or water rescue, which is usually the one that kind of comes to mind when I think of like military rescue. But then there's like combat rescue, like the Scotto anything which will touch on UM. And then there's like the normal search and rescue I think a lot of people think of, which is somebody getting lost in the woods or their desert or something, and a bunch of sheriff's deputies kind of spread out and start looking for you deputies and just people. Yes, did you know that before you research this article, that people like dedicate themselves to spend their own money to up on training and equipment and things. Yeah. The reason I know that is because, um my dad had a touch of this um when he owned a jeep years ago, and I told stories about him going out on snowy days and using his toe innch to pull people out of ditches. So that was I was just aware of their being a general like thing with certain outdoors people where there they had like they like to get in in there and volunteer, and if they hear someone's trapped in the woods near their house, they're out there. Like I knew they existed, but there's like an actual pro sess you can go through and become a registered like searcher. Yeah, And I think some of these people are just do gooders and some of them maybe we're like man, I never was able to become the uh, the wilderness firefighter that I wanted to be or the paramedic maybe, And so I'm going to get the state to force them to hang out with me while we like this is how can live out that unfulfilled? Uh I was about to say fantasy, but that means it unfulfilled, you know, desire dream, all of them. And then there's the last group of people who are like, I want to see a dead body in the woods. They start joining star Man. Don't get teamed up with that guy. It doesn't always and that always the way, though it doesn't always work out, is the thing. Sometimes search and rescue becomes searching recovery. Yeah, but uh, I mean most of this applies to it as well, because search and rescue typically starts out as or searching recovery starts out as search and rescue. Right, there's always it's kind of neat, like, if you think about it, there's really no better quick sketch of humanity than a group of people who have never met some the person they're looking for, take their time and effort and put themselves in peril to go try to find somebody who's missing and starts out on the hopes that they're still alive. Yeah, and that a lot of times what we were talking about there is like the um someone was hiking and got lost, and these people kind of regularly go out and do this. Uh. But then the stuff that really gets me is like the Missing Child, where entire communities come together to form you know, quarter mile long lines walking through a field or the forest together. That's the stuff. This is like, Man, I can't even take it. Yeah, you know, way to bring it down, Chuck, Hey, that's what I'm here. So uh so okay, so let's start at the start. So, if you if you wanted to be a I don't. I guess there's a it's professional, right, If you're in the Coastguard or in the military, and you're trained for this, you're a professional search and rescue person, right. It's not like you have your regular duty and then on the side you get called out for star stuff. Well. I don't know about that. I mean I think I don't think that's necessarily the case. I think the Coast Guard, well, we'll have to find that out. Actually it's I don't think they're sitting around waiting on a rescue. Yeah. The thing is is I saw that the Coastguard rescues in average of a hundred and fourteen people a day, So they're always just rescuing so I wonder if they have like they're just yeah, that's what they do, is some there's their search and rescue. People are searching and rescuing all day every day. I don't know. I'm stimmied right out of the gate. Sorry, man, But we'll we'll start with the Coast Guard because they're actually the heart of search and rescue. They've been doing this for at least fifty years now. Yeah. I mean, there's a school in Yorktown, Virginia called the National Star School, and it's operated by the Air Force and the Coast Guard. And their motto is really great, always ready comma that others may live. And I believe a couple of years ago they celebrated their fiftieth anniversary. Is a school, yeah, because when I wrote this, I believe it was the anniversary. Yea, the most recent. This thing is so old. You were talking about a change that Noel was undertaking in two thousand nine. In future tents like nine comes around. If it does, the gray beard hairs are really showing. Uh. So they have three simultaneous classes of students going on at this our school at all times, and their goal is a program is uh to say at least of people and of property that's at risk. Pretty good goal. Yeah, And to be ready to be there and ready, I believe within two hours total response time and to be like ready to go within a half hour. Right, so like the moment they're activated to the moment they show up on seeing two hours tops pretty good. Yeah, that's great. And then imagine like rescuing. Let's split the difference. At first it was and they're like that's shooting a little high exactly, but nineties not enough? Yeah, and being uh, you know, going through the test and the physical and mental testing for this is tough. Yeah. So when I was researching this initially, I was thinking like, oh, this is cool or whatever, but I've actually come to admire anybody who does this, not just because they're out doing this, but there's a lot of things that they're doing that I can't. And now we've really entered that thicket, which is like, um, the rescue swimmers test. And so so the whole thing starts out with pull ups, which right there, I'm done. I'll give you three tops, maybe fifteen chin ups? Aren't they the same thing? There? Do you put like the chin on the bar and a chin up it's different. Chin ups are knuckles facing you pull ups or knuckles facing out, So chin up pull up pull ups are harder. Yeah either way, maybe three tops because chin ups you can you know, kick and swing yourself up. But a pull up, especially if you do the Studley arms apart pull up like that number. Yeah, No, mine are like right under my face. Yeah. So, um, you got twenty five of those, followed by a hundred yard obstacle course. I'm assuming it's a pretty rough obstacle course. I haven't seen pictures of it. Yeah, and this is while you're carrying two fifty pound dumbbells. Again, have you ever picked up a fifty pound dumbell? Just once? It's not comfortable, Never do it again, and you especially don't want to do it while you're doing it obstacle course that's the size of a football field, right. Uh So then you're timed while you march one mile and you think big deal. This is after you've already done these other things though, and you're carrying a forty pound rescued letter, which is it's called the Stokes basket too. It's a it's that caged stretcher that you see so often on the news and in the Perfect Storm. I like that movie. It's a great movie. I don't know about great, but it's a good movie. That's good enough. You convinced me. Uh. And then it's still not over because then you get into your rescue harness. You put on your fins and your snorkel, and you swim a third of a mile pulling a victim in one of these rescue letters. You swim a third of a mile to the victim, and then another third of a mile. You gotta do all that in twenty seven minutes. And I think this is after you know, it's not like they're like, all right, we'll go rest a few hours and then you'll do this next part. Plus they make they make you chug a cup of pancake batter at every stop. And so that's just the swimming art. Uh. There's also the inland training, which you gotta learn to climb rocks, you gotta learn to repel. Uh. There's a hundred and eighty pound dummy that they like tangle up in a tree fifty six ft in the air to get it. Yeah, you gotta figure that out. Sometimes they have combo scenarios like this dude's in the tree. This dude's in the water, Like, go figure it out and don't use rocks to get the one out of the tree. No, it doesn't count never. So, Um, that's pretty that's the Coastguard, and I think the Air Force, um go in for that same academy, or maybe all members of the military go to the Coastguard one. I believe yes, so that if you're a military search and rescue person, you train at the Coastguard academy for it, right, right, if you're just a normal everyday person and you want to do it. There are our schools around the country, but they're all private. There's no accreditation. Um. I think it's probably buy or beware in some of those cases, but I also got the impression that there's actual legitimate like s our schools. It's not just somebody who's like thanks for the money, chump, buy or beware as opposed to full guaranteed or your money back, right you will find your first person or all your your tuition is is reimbursed. Uh. And then some of these folks ride horses. It's called mounted star and horses. Even though it's an age old way of getting around or really valuable um in search and rescue for quite a few reasons. Yeah. Like, first of all, their horses, so I can go farther than your dumb human meat body. Sure. Plus they're nice to have around as well. They're nice to have around, and they can get you to places where you could kind of walk, but you probably shouldn't be walking. A horse might be a little more sure footed or a donkey. Uh yeah, and um yeah, I like how you said, if you've been sitting in the lab analyzing stuff for the last few years, you might benefit from riding a horse out to a search of riscue you location. Yeah, I mean that's a movie seen waiting to happen, if it hasn't already. It is. Um Wayne Night just griping all mad that he's being dragged out into the woods, right, but then they put him on the horse. He's backwards on the horse. Somebody stop this thing. Uh. The other thing you can do, obviously, the horse is a lot stronger than a person. So if you need a rescue leader towed up the side or you know, pulled up the side of a cliff, you can attach it to a horse and then then you're gonna tell him about the radio thing. I never thought of this. It's good. Go ahead. So you can station horses in position along a route when you get further and further into the woods. And if you keep a radio transmitter on each one, it acts as like a radio relay network. Just install a bluetooth into a horse's ear, tin horses ears and you've got coms. Not bad, It isn't bad at all. I feel like we should take a break. All right, let's do that and we'll talk about urban SAR right after this. All right, ma'am. So we're talking about you sare or US and R yes, depending on who you're talking to. This is um. This is a whole different type of fish settle of fish um. When you're talking about urban starro is not woods. It's not like cliffs, it's not the ocean. It is enormous skyscrapers that have crumbled in on themselves and there you're sure that there are people trapped inside and you have to figure out how to get into these this rubble and get them out without getting killed yourself. Yeah, and this is a division of FEMA. UM probably should come no surprise and believe in n is when they set this up. The National Response plan for disasters and they have twenty five national use AR task forces and in the case of a flood or earthquake, what else hurricane, plane crash, has met, spills, tornadoes, any natural disaster, a terrorist attack. Um, I think they they They were all called out for the Oklahoma City bombing. UM, definitely nine eleven, UM, Katrina. They were integral and UM some of the bigger ones that you can list off. Basically every single one of these task forces was called in to the to to assist. Yeah, and assist is the key word there, because they are supporting UH local and state emergency systems who generally take the lead in these cases. Thirty one people I think per team for a US OUR task force. And how many did they deployed? Twenty of these on nine eleven, like right out of the gate. Yeah, I think all of them except for Virginia was activated in Virginia's was at the Pentagon instead, but like the rest of them were in New York for nine eleven. It was just I was reading a in firsthand account from a Star Team member at nine eleven and they were just like it was this utter chaos, Like the people who were in charge were all dead when the second tower collapsed. Um, there was just like he said, there was just a total leadership vacuum that got filled pretty quickly. But I've never seen anything like this before. It was nuts. But the just the way that they had to improvise was pretty pretty astounding. Oh yeah, And there's all sort of secondary dangers you know, after a building like that collapses, the well, I mean, I guess we can talk about a little bit, but I mean everything from hazardous materials leaking to you know, electricity down to electricity that could you know shock and kill you too, water mains bursting and you know, filling up spaces and drowning people. It's like there every single front you can imagine they're attacking. So one of the first things they do. UM. Again, every every UM search and rescue situation or every disaster is actually operated initially by the local cops. That's who runs search and rescue, and like you said, femas there to assist, and usually the state agencies are there to assist too. But UM, one of the first things that happens when femas UM you saw our teams come on the scene is they have like structural engineers who are licensed professional engineers who have experience in construction or inspection or something like that, who come in and say they look at this. So once this was a nice, tidy structure. Now it's a different kind of structure and it's not tidy at all, and there's a lot of hidden dangers. But their job is to come in and assess the the structure of the rubble and figure out how to create safe passage into this thing. And they it's pretty amazing that they can do it at all. Yeah, and yeah, you mentioned the dogs, so we won't get too heavy into that, but um, I believe that the largest deployment of dogs in history was for nine eleven. Yeah, I think at least, Yeah, search and rescue dogs. It worked twelve hours at a time. All right, that's enough about search and rescue dogs and I value them, Can I say that? Sure? That's that's no big news, No, take it back. So, um, one of the ways you want to talk about what they do when they come into these structures and figure out what to do. Sure, I didn't know this, I guess I had never thought about what they would do. But there there are kevlar bags that you can put underneath up the seventy ton pieces of like concrete or metal or whatever and inflate them and it will actually lift them up to like almost two feet off of the ground. It's pretty amazing. And then once you have that, you start to shore it up. You put in steel beams and then or would depending on how heavy whatever you're lifting is, and you actually start to create basically like an old timey like Minor forty nine or mine shaft into this place, just shoring up and lifting and shoring up and along the way to to stabilize the structure. And then once you have entry into this place, then you start sending in different kinds of rescuers. So you've got like the medics who go in. You have people who are sending cameras or listening devices um to to try to find survivors. You've got the people who are testing the air quality to make sure that the air conditions are the conditions of the air aren't like deadly. Yeah, I mean, can you imagine this is all like you're you're on the clock too, so like you have to make sure it's safe to go in there, so you're just not killing people that are going in to rescue and but at the same time you're trying to get people out of there. You're not just like, let me go investigate the scene and what's going on down there. It's like you're on a timer, but you have to make sure it's done safely too. It's just like, I can't imagine how overwhelming that must be, rescue effort leader. Yeah, because there are people who are running this whole show, doing their logistics people. There are people who are overseeing everybody and making sure that this whole chaotic scene is running smoothly. I can't imagine a more stressful job, especially having that clock taking on lives, just just draining away, just hanging over your head. That's just nuts. And people do this. Yeah, and you, like you said, you've got has Matt specialists there. You might have to suit up yourself before you go in. You might have heard on your listening device or from a camera that some people are trapped like hundred feet into a place you can't even get so you send them like breathing tubes, or you might send a rescue letter down there and say, if you can get in this thing and strap yourself in, we may be able to pull you out because we can't get in, do you write? But at the same time, you have like heavy equipment operators running like cranes and bulldozers trying to like pick off the pieces that the structural engineers and said like you can get ready to that one. Get and they'll they'll like lift them up and move them and try to remove as much stuff as they can. But yeah, all again, all this the clock is ticking. Do you remember the I think it was the Bay Bridge collapse in San Francisco during the World Series and I think the earthquake, Yeah, it just so happened. San Francisco is playing Oakland in the World Series and that that earthquake happened, And do you remember, like the whole the top deck just fell down onto the other deck on top of people in their cars, and like some people survived. It's amazing that there are people out there that, like I would just start crying in place and huddle in a corner, but there are people out there that can stay calm enough and are experienced enough to just be like, all right, well this is what we do starting right now. Man. Yeah, those are the people who slap people like you and me and tell us to snap out of it. Share shares. One of those people, and maybe some of those people think, can you imagine sitting there and talking about our job, right and uh, explaining what we do? How perilous that is for these two. That's right. I got a paper cut earlier. I wasn't gonna say anything about it. It was rough. Help prove your point. We should shout out the Civil Air Patrol though, even though I do want to do a show on that. Um, they are a nonprofit with more than I don't know what the numbers are now, but when I wrote this, there were more than fifty five thousand civilian pilots and cadets, and they since have supplemented our own military's aviation. Uh. It's pretty neat and like Roderick was a he was pretty young when he did this too. I guess he was a cadet. I got you that you my guess. I'll bet you have the most polished shoes you've ever seen. I'll have to ask him about it, because I've never I've never actually spoken with him at length about it. Yeah, I think it was a it's civilians, right, okay, And it was originally supposed to be like we're the liaison between the Air Force and and the rest of civilian America. But then they said, hey, we think there's some Nazi submarines off the coast of Maine. Can you start dropping bombs too? And they said, getty up. Oh, I'm sure they were delighted. They started dropping bombs in depth charges in World War Two and things were never the same after that. Yeah, so Civil Air Patrol, your day is coming. Okay, sorry, I just gave a little more information if you want to go back and edit that out. So we talked a little bit about some of the equipments are um, you saw I should say carries with them, but it's impressive. And again, if you were a mayor and your local sheriff for your local police chief for the police commission called you and said, um, we had a building collapse and we need some help. You call the governor and the governor says, ah, well, we'll see what we can do, but we think this is a federal thing. They call the president and the President says, FEMA, good on there, and FEMA comes free of charge with trade tractor trailers full of supplies. From what I saw, it's about one point just one Task Forces equipment is like a one point four million dollar package of sixteen thousand, four hundred pieces of equipment, everything from like medical supplies, the generators, to the bulldozers to everything. And they just show up and say, how can we help. You're in charge, how can we help? Yeah, And it's almost like, uh, all the mundane things of assembling. It's like assembling a film shoot or something. You're like, well, these people have to eat, they have to go to the bathroom. Like yeah, they need to sleep, they need to rest. Uh, so you have to set up like a little a village, like in the case of a nine eleven or any major disaster like that. Um. Yeah, I mean it's pretty astounding, like the one. I imagine this list grows daily, uh, because the one thing you don't want to ever happen is to be on the scene of was something of a natural disaster and be like give me the the thing. They're like, oh, we didn't back that thing. Why not? Well, I like it's a nice round number. But like you said, everything from like chainsaws and jackammers to like bolt cutters and porta potties, which we did an episode on. We'll probably do on on bolt cutters. One day twenty years from now, we did one on jackammers. Did uh should we talk about a SAR yeah, um eron c Yeah. So this is where the the extraordinarily trained rescue swimmers and divers come into play. Yeah, this is amazing. I think it's the STATU got in here. Was it has a fift dropout rate. Yeah, look to go to the school. There's there's like higher you know, spending in the ear No. I mean there's there's other military schools that have higher wash out rates, but not many. Yeah, it's mostly special forces. I think the Ranger school typically has about the same wash out rate as the uh, the rescue diver school, re excuse swimmer school. It's it's substantial. Like you there's a really good chance you're not gonna make it, actually a fifty percent chance you're not gonna make it. The Coast Guard says that, And this is pretty interesting. Of all sea rescues are less than twenty miles from shore, and nine of these are only rescue. Um. Thankfully, because of all of our distress beacons that we're armed with these days, like you can usually well nine of the time, you can find these people pretty quickly. At least. Yeah, and the Coast Guard, and I don't remember exactly when it was, but they updated the um distress system that they had since the seventy s where you called in on a radio frequency and said made a made a and tried to give your position. Maybe you had a beacon that was operating on that frequency that they could try to track. They updated all that with something called Rescue twenty one is in the century. That's way more sophisticated than it was before. And so now they still monitor that channel for for voice may days. But if you press your beacon, it's it enters this vast computer and communications network that the Coast Guard maintains in at least a twenty mile area outside of all of America's shores, and um it's you're gonna get their attention pretty quick. Yeah, and uh, these beacons now they operate at four and six mega hurts. That's the newer standard. Oh no, they will as of two thousand nine one day. Um Man, I was a young man when I wrote this. Jeez, just a little pup, just a little pup. These things are manually activated a lot of times, but they can also be automatically activated. So like if it hits water, like not if you spill water on it, but that's that's submerged in water, like the boat is sinking, it'll automatically activate. Or and this is cool, it's if it goes above a certain g force, then that means bad things have happened. Don't take it on a roller coaster. One thing I saw about that Rescue twenty one is one of the updates that they made too. It was it has geo locating now, so they can tell where a distressed call is actually coming from. Yeah, like it's satellite been pointed right. Um, But that actually does away with the prank calls of yesteryear. People would actually prank called distress calls into the Coastguard. That's so expensive, and now they can be like, we can see you're calling from Nevada. You're not out on the Pacific Ocean right now. You jerk in that terrible Can you imagine leading the Coastguard in a wild goose chase? What kind of jerk would you have to be? Are you like some sort of of unstable search and rescue guys, Like, let's get out there. It's like the arsonists who are also firefighters. Very interesting, I thought so too. And then one more thing about the distressed beacons. There's a new so the weather satellites that Noah operates, NASA has onboard instrumentation that they have an a star office themselves. NASA does, and their whole thing is basically tracking human beings through their beacons. Hopefully just through their beacons and not through like I don't know, their cell phones. But now if you press your beacon, it immediately goes up and immediately gets shot out to the rest of the um. There's actually a global search and rescue network, so wherever you are in the world, that distress signal will be spread out. And then in the meantime, as they're getting their resources together, they can start to try to find where you are. But they get their attention almost instantanea instantaneously now thanks to NASA. Yeah, and then eventually the beacons will will be that instantaneous and also give out your coordinates down to something like a hundred hundred meters. I thought you're gonna say, eventually it will predict your disaster. No, eventually, it'll just shoot a tractor beam down onto you, pill you up to the satellite, and it'll it'll land you at Edwards Air Force Base and serve you a nice hot meal and send you on your way. That's the future, all right. So combats are is next? And uh, I don't know. I just I don't think about this stuff a lot because I generally just think of the military is like, well, they just do everything. I thought that Gene Hackman assembled like ragtag groups of people that go in behind enemy lines. Like ten years later, I thought, that's how we did it. What was that? Uncommon? Valid? Maybe one of the best post Vietnam movies of all time? I don't know about that. Have you seen it lately? I saw it within the last probably five of yours. Really, Yeah, dude, it's good A right that I'm not a gun guy, but when that guy um gives Gene Hackman the menu of the like heavy artillery, it's still pretty cool when you see it, Like I would take that one and that one. It's so funny, Like I think, I don't know, we're not gun guys at all, yet the notion of a gun menu just lights us up. What is that all about? There's some part of our brain just brainwashing from movies. Yeah, probably, I guess, you know, sure, that's my guess. Alright, So c sar they're there. They're basically kind of the first people to arrive behind enemy lines and in the course of battle, and the U. S. Air Force takes lead in this situation. So anytime there's like a Scott O Grady situation where someone has let's say, ejected from their jet behind enemy lines, dude on fire. Yeah, that's the worst case scenario probably, Um, that is when c s are really uh earns their metal. Yeah, you know, and you, I mean, the story of Scotto Grady kind of says it all right, Um, it's their metal test, their metal to eventually earn a metal. What I meant, yea, I think you got it all together. So, Um, I think the Air Force still is tasked with combat search and rescue, but they're starting to do it jointly with the army I think as well. But they have um, what it called expeditionary rescue squadrons. That is the name of the people that you want coming after you. Yeah, Um, and they go in, like you said, behind enemy lines, Um, under a tremendous amount of danger. There's usually two helicopters. Um. One goes in and actually airlifts the person out. The other helicopter is there to like shot shoot at people, yeah, and be like stay back, stay back, um, because this is the like again, it's behind enemy lines, one of your pilots has been shot down. When you guys have gotten lost or captured or something, these are the people who go in and get them. Yeah. They have planes to long range search planes like the h C one thirty which can actually refuel these helicopters to h H sixties, which U they said, the hell the planes are when there was like not much of a threat then I think the helicopters they use up to a medium threat. But like you said, they have you know, ground support going on too. Yeah, and there was like a real push to update their um their helicopter that they used to one that's specifically designed for c SAR. But I think the plug got pulled on it, so there's still I think working with the is that the h H sixties obey they call him double H six zeros that's even longer. Okay, Uh. This is kind of the cool part for me for c SAR is you don't really think about this, but if someone has been shot down and they do have radio comms ability and they can get in touch with you. You you need to be able to authenticate this signal, whether it's a beacon or a real human voice on the other end, because they could be compromised. They could be sitting there with a collision, a cough to their head and uh being forced to like you know, lure someone into a trap of a foreign enemy. Right, So you have to be able to authenticate these calls. And they do that by never giving their full uh details over the radio, like as it stands. They'll say, it's like add numbers or subtract or multiplied digits, and you're like call signs and your rank and your unit numbers and stuff like that, right, and then they verify who you are. And they once they verify who you are, they'll come get you. But there are more Some conditions are more ideal than others. And when Scott O'Grady very famously went down um in Bosnia during the Balkan War, I think they he they received his distress signal finally, I think six days on he'd been surviving by like drinking the sweat out of his own socks and eating bugs and spending the whole time evading UM getting captured did of just an amazing job of staying alive and staying uncaptured. UM. But he sent out his beacon or they received his beacon or distress signal like a couple hours before dawn, and they're like, this guy has already been missing for six days. We found him. We can't let him just stay for another six days because the ideal conditions are after dark. They couldn't do that. So two hours after that, UM, they went in after him like in broad daylight, I guess, And w wasn't it marines had actually got him out? And what was wasn't it like twenty minutes or something ridiculous too? Oh, two minutes from the time they arrived to the extraction to the time they were gone again. Yeah, I'm sure he wasn't lollygag And I'm sure and he was like, let's go. He's like, oh wait, I forgot my basket I was making with reads. I got to go back and get it. Uh, pretty amazing. So I saw about his story, I looked up what happened with him. He released a book called Return with Honor, and you know, they made that movie Behind Enemy Lines with Owen Wilson and Gene Gene Hackman. Again, he was like the guy who was trying to get Owen Wilson out. I never saw that movie. He sued Fox, twenty Century Fox, and then eventually Discovery Channel. He sued um No. He sued for basically appropriating his life story. Uh. And the problem that he publicly said he had with it was that Owen Wilson used foul language, was portrayed as a hot dog pilot, and disobeyed orders, and that Scott O Grady was none of those. Now was he actually scott O Grady in the movie or debate? Thinly disguise? It thinly disguise, which meant they didn't need to pay him any royalties, right, and it also probably many lost his lawsuit. Imagine, right, I don't know. I didn't see that. I just saw like a two thousand one Entertainment Weekly article on it, the definitive source. It's good journalism, man. All right, well, let's take a break and we'll talk about some search techniques and other fun stuff right after this. All right, now, this feels like a no brainer, but it's actually a little more interesting than you would think. Establishing your search area. Yeah, so let's say, where do you look now we've moved on to somebody, say like lost in its is a really good example of this, right, happens a lot, And there's like, if you're a sheriff's deputy, you may or may not have any star training. If you're the sheriff, you may or may not have any star training. That's probably unlikely these days, but it's a possibility. But even if you're the only one in your department, you've got a whole department who you need to explain what to do. And the first thing you have to do is start looking for uh answers to your questions. But you need to know what questions you have to ask first. So if you're looking for any kind of evidence specifically of where the last place the person was seen was, that's the first thing you want to find. Yeah, last scene uh or I think last sing can also be last uh. Well if that's not true, because last known position is different. So if someone was last seen leading a trailhead um for their for their hike, let's say they were last seeing at noon starting at this trailhead. That means that another human being who's now talking to you as an eyewitness said, I saw this person. Yeah, like maybe they either saw someone on the trail or they checked into a ranger station and got their back country permit or something. They're like, I'm off so long, suckers. Uh. That is different though, than last known position. So if someone is missing their last known uh last scene place, maybe the trailhead, but three miles in, if they find that person's baseball cap, then that is they're all of a sudden their last known position. If you compare that to where they started, you might be able to reasonably come up with maybe they're headed in this direction and they might be somewhere in this area by now. That would be an enormous break because if you can figure out when they were last seen, like you're saying, and then when this thing was found, you know the direction and roughly the speed that there they're going. Yeah, and this is there are a lot of assumptions involved here, um, but hopefully you're you know, hopefully one wasn't like they dropped their baseball hat and then decided to go in a completely different direction they did. They close your eyes and twirled around and just headed out. Yeah, so that's the that's how that works, Um, But generally it's a it's a circle unless you starting from the last the place they were last laid eyes on, right, Yeah, because they could theoretically be going in any position in any direction. Um, unless you come up with something called the choke point, which is kind of interesting. Uh. That is where you have either a man made feature or some sort of geological natural feature that cuts off an area, like like I think definitely, yeah, couldn't have climbed that three ft cliffs, So now we can go in this direction across that crazy river. Yeah, and the say, if it's a river, if it's a cliff, you can just position somebody at that cliff and be like, stay here in case you see them. If it's a river, you can say, well they would have if they wanted to cross, they'd have to go to this bridge to stay here on this bridge in case they come this way. That's one thing to do when you have a choke point, right. Yeah. So if you have a searcher named Cliff and to searcher name river, yes, to avoid confusion. And if Jeff Bridges is searching as well or Bow Bridges either one, well, I think we know that Jeff would be doing the searching, right, I don't know. I think would just be telling him how to do it. Maybe he is the boss, the older brother. Man, those guys are the best, Like they're there. Have you met bo I've never met either one of them, but I've just heard interviews with both and they're like, they're like brothers should be. Oh you've heard interviews with them together, no separately talking about each other. It is very sweet. They're like best buds. That's cool and very big brother little brother. Yeah, it's kind of neat. I wonder what the quaids are like. Man, I'm curious about that because Randy is you know, yeah, I know he's developed into something else. So oh oh, So if you were searching from the last position, no, not the last known position, last place scene, yes, the last place scene. So that's where you start. If you're searching from that and you start heading out and you find that baseball cap, that is a huge clue, like I said, and probably the people who found it are what are called the hasty search team, because right when you establish a last place scene, you send some people out who are usually like very experienced, very well trained star people, and they start scrambling out in every direction in that circle lightfoot looking for Yeah, that's a part of it. They probably climb a tree like nothing, um looking going to the places where it would be most likely that somebody like this would would go to. Yeah, and that's uh. When they think, like, you know, this person is in danger, there's a storm coming in or night is falling and it's going to get really cold, you deploy these hasty search teams that they're not out there coming the ground for clues. No, but I think it is a matter of course that the first thing you do is deploy the hasty team. Then you follow up with the deliberate people. Yeah, the the clue team, that's what we'll call them, Colonel Mustard. They get a little slower and they are and I think this, I mean, well, I guess it kind of depends. It could be for someone just trapped in the woods, but definitely they use these for those community searches when like a kid is missing or something. These are the things you see on the news and people are walking very slowly through the woods because a clue could be a a cigarette butt on the ground, you know, and you have people say space twenty ft apart, and each one is responsible for everything ahead of them, and ten ft to the side and ten ft to the other side, and then that way, if everybody is doing what they're supposed to be doing, every square inch of this this search area is covered eventually by this these searchers, the second group of searchers. Yeah, they'll also use track traps sometime, so they'll like maybe go to a trail, uh, a place on a trail or any place really, and they will put like sand on the ground and then they can go back and check that sand if there were footprints, they know that it wasn't wasn't their footprints, So that might have be a last known position perhaps, So Chuck, if you get lost and they find you and they say, hey, come back with us, you might say, uh, no, I'll find my own way back. I'll crawl back myself, even though my leg's broken. Why would a human being do that? Well, Uh, because you might get a bill at the end of the day or a week or month, depending on what state you get lost in. Yeah, this is a bit of a This is a lightning rod in the outdoor community because there's a lot of facets to this um. One facet is, Hey, if you did something dumb and you went somewhere where you weren't supposed to go, and you weren't equipped to do this or experience enough to do this, why should a taxpayer have to fit foot your sixty dollar bill of rescue. It's a legitimate point. It's a legitimate point. So they say, pass laws in some states to deter people from doing something stupid. On the other hand, on them, the other side says, search and rescue is a pure public service, just like you don't get a bill from the fire department. If you do this kind of thing, then people will think twice about calling for help. If they don't have the money and they know they're going to get a sixty bill, they might actually just put it off too long, and then by the time they say, okay, fine, I need some help, it's too late and they're going to die out there. You don't want anybody thinking about money during a search and rescue operation. Yeah, I mean, it's it's sort of a weird balance you're trying to strike between encouraging people to get out and explore the wilderness, but only wanting people that are to go in certain places, and that have a certain experience level to do so, and certainly not like like the worst case scenario like you were talking about, is I'm in trouble, but I'm not gonna send out my beacon. So apparently the Colorado Search and Rescue Board actually put together fifteen cases This is according to Outside Magazine, of people who actually delayed calling for help to Yeah, because they um, they knew that they would be charged or there was a chance that they would be charged like they So it actually happens. It's not hypothetical like it. It happens in real life. So there are some states like New Hampshire apparently is the the last place you want to um have a search undertaken for you, because they actually do bill. They've done something like seventy dollars in billing for like sixty rescues since two thousand eight. Are pretty low cost rescues. Yeah, it's surprising like this one guy in this article is search and rescue a public service? Not exactly is the name of the article. And there was a man named Ed Beacon who had an artificial hip, went hiking by himself on a bad weather day, tried to jump onto a ledge and dislocated that artificial hip and took it all the way to the state Supreme Court when he didn't want to pay his nine thousand bill, and the state Supreme Court said, sorry, yeah, because New Hampshire has in their law it says you can be billed if you were shown to have been negligent. And the state Supreme Court are agreed with the case against him that said he had a replacement hip, so a faulty hip, and he knew that there was a large possibility of bad weather. They said, stay home, old man, basically, and hey, yeah, but he fought it up to the Supreme Court and loss and after that you got yeah, you got no recourse. Yeah, and there's uh, there are quite a few states that have laws like this on the books that range from very specific to very broad. And uh, just because your state has this on the books a lot of times is to dissuade people from being dumb. Um. It doesn't mean you're gonna get hit with a bill. Even if they have the law on the books. It's up to them whether or not they want to pursue that. And then a lot of states have programs um that you can pay anywhere from three bucks to twenty five dollars to basically say, if you've paid this money, that means that you don't get charged for rescue. Right. It's like a communal pot that everybody pays into with the chances of them actually needing it very slim, but they do need it, then they've got it. Yeah, which I think is a great idea. Not bad. I think any outdoor enthusiasts that regularly does this with they're three dollars, you know, for a year per year. Yeah, that's not bad at all. Yeah, And the federal government apparently does not um, although they could always change, you never know, but they don't get reimbursed, but they have a policy of not charging. Yeah. Um. Last thing I saw there was an app. You know, I'm crazy for apps like Gluco for diabetes. There's also an app called Drones SAR and it basically takes over your drone and and flies your drone in a search pattern for a search and rescue mission. So this is if you're a drone pilot who has lost no, if you have one of those rotor multi rotor drones that you like to fly around and buzze your neighbor's roof with so your drone pilot, if you show up to a UM search and rescue mission, I got a drone you want to use it, It's got a video camera on it. They say, sure, download drone Star and you drone Star app will take over your your drone and fly it as part of this search. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Shout out to my buddy Lowell, my sister in law's boyfriend is a drone pilot. A couple of shout it's for Lowell. He's a drone pilot and a good one. I've seen. I've seen him in action, and you know, it's not the easiest thing the world to do. He doesn't he doesn't crash these things. Although it's kind of funny to see drone fails on YouTube UM because it's always going great until like there was one I saw today where there was a some sort of ape or monkey preserve and they were flying all around. It's like, man, this is gorgeous. Look at all these apes and monkeys doing their thing. And then it flies up close to one and this monkey just fully takes a stick and goes whack. And then the next thing you know, you see it falling on the ground and then you know, all these monkeys start descending upon it and like poking and stuff. It's pretty neat. So shout out to Lowell for that. And I meant to say a few weeks ago, I finally vaped with Lowell. What gave it a try? I was like, you know what, he's a vapor. We got a lot of flak for dissing vapors. Uh uh. And I was like, all right, let me try it. And it was one of those you know, flavored things with no nicotine. No, it had nicotine. Okay, at least at least you're smoking nicotine. Yeah, And it was I will say this, it was interesting. So are you hooked on vaping now, are you? No? No, no, no, no, I'm not. I never did it again. I took a couple of puffs. It's like, well, that's interesting. It tastes it was like banana, okay, And I was like, I didn't have quite how to wrap my head around still like the pleasure of inhaling vapi banana like. But the funny thing is I can't stop thinking about it. It was weird. I was like, I mean, it wasn't like, oh this is disgusting, but I didn't want to do it again either. That's good, Charles. I think that is the lesson here. I just thought i'd give it a shot. So well, good for you for trying new things. Don't ever do that again, yea lulls leading me? Done it bad? Ah? You got anything else? Nope, So we got a whole sweet coming. Just wait, everybody, I can't wait. Uh. And in the meantime, you can look up Chuck's awesome articles Star Search and Rescue on how stuff works in the search bar. Since I said search bar's time for listener mail, I'm gonna call this golf pro. Golf pro, Hey, guys. Like many in the golf business, my first job included time as a picker as a teenager, and of course I soon became acquainted with the multiple bangs and clangs of titlists ricocheting off every side of the cage. Remember we talked about taking aim on the driving range at those folks going and beatles. A few years later, when I was a beginning my career as an assistant pro, I found myself supervising these kids, one of whom relished his time on the range and especially the chance to engage in good natured trash talk whenever his card came within reach. On one such occasion, after a friend and I had missed him on several point blank attempts, he turned the card away from us to make another pass on the far into the range, confident that our aim would certainly not be better. As he moved further away, traveling in a direct line away from me, he had reached a distance about a hundred and fifty yards when my laser beam three iron shot took flight on a low trajectory and never left its target. It came as a surprise to him and to me when, instead of the usual clang followed by laughter, we heard a dull thud and a low groan. It turned out our range picker, which is the car, included a narrow gap of about two and a half inches where the back of the cage met the top of the seat in the rear of the cart. Despite my countless hours in that old machine, I never noticed that. Neither had he. Thankfully, his likable demeanor had led him to be well tipped by the membership, and the wallet in his back pocket, thick with dozens of dollar bills, took the brunt of the below Uh, I don't see how that would have happened. But if he was sitting on his wallet, had to hit him in the butt. Maybe it's a tiny maybe he has a big but I don't know. I don't know either. I would love this guy, So Brian says, as I have never made a hole in one, this still stands as my best shot I've ever had. And one might argue that, uh, it's even more difficulty. And that is Brian. He is a golf bro. Thanks Brian, and Northern Cali. And he said to both of us, if we're ever out in Carmel and we want to a play golf, alright with a golf bro, we could do that. Or if we want to actually drive the picker, he would let us do that. I just rather play golf. I want to do both. Okay, well, shoot, let's do it. Let's do it. Thanks a lot, Brian. That was also an excellent, well written email. If you if you ask me, it's great. Brian Sleeman. He's the head pro at the Preserve Golf Club. Is it basically John Cheever short story? Maybe uptick? I don't know one of the two. Uh, if you want to get in touch with me, and chuck and offer us something awesome like Brian did.
