Josh: Welcome to Stuff You Should Know, a production of five Heart Radios How Stuff Works. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant over there, and we've got the scoop. Jerry's around here somewhere, and this is Stuff you Should Know. Off to a great start. She's in hers, she is she's got this remote thing going on. Uh, it's like the COVID special, that's right. Uh. And this was this has been what I've been wanting to do since two thousand sixteen, and why it seems like the fire kind of went down on it and now it's the fires back up again. In election season, I thought no better time than to talk election polling and this weird sort of black magic which is really not black magic at all. And it was, um, the polling wasn't even really that off. No, it was great. There was a furious fear we'll talk about in a second, but there's a furious reaction by the media just left polling and polsters out to dry, saying like you you're terrible. Your whole craft is is useless. As the pollsters went back after election night on two thousand and sixteen, which, by the way, is a bit of a surprise to everybody involved. Um. Yeah, when the pollsters went back and looked at their stuff, they said, wait a minute, no, this is this is all fine. It was you guys, media, You screwed up. You don't know what polling is or what it does, or how to talk about it. Most importantly, Yeah, and then you public, you have no idea what's going on. You just see some percentages and you automatically leaked to some conclusions and this is way off. So it's impartant that the media was misrepresenting it. Some polls weren't very good. And then, um, the public in general just needs to be a bit more educated on statistics to understand what they're hearing. And that's what we're here for. Because I I took statistics three times in college, the same course at Georgia. At Georgia, I took one of those classes. I hated it, intro to statistics, right, yeah, boy, I hated the class. The professor. Finally I walked up to her on the last day of the third time, was like please, and she bumped my d up to a seat and I was I never looked back. She say you have a one in four chance, and you're like, but what does that mean? Right? What is four? But so if I can understand this after doing some research, then anybody can understand at least the gist of it enough to understand polling and not be taken in by bad representation of what poll results are. Yeah. So, if you remember, in there were polsters saying or I'm sorry and I'm gonna say that wrong over and over again. You had media saying that Hillary Clinton is going to win in a landslide. Um, she's got a chance to win some set as high is ninety five, She's gonna win the popular vote by three percentage points. Um, all the all the battleground states in the Midwest, Um, she's gonna win those narrowly. And it did not work out that way. And like you said, there was a furor over how could everyone be this wrong with the polling. And there's man named Nate Silver, who everyone probably knows at this point, who has made his name as a data specialist and runs the five thirty eight blog and said, you know what, um pulling is flawed. And that's probably the first thing that everyone should understand is all polling is a little bit flawed. Um, state polling is is definitely a little more flawed than national polling. But here's the deal, everybody, these polls from we're not only not so far off, but historically, dating back to since nineteen seventy two, they actually performed a little better than a lot of elections. Yeah, and the state polling, while worse than average, wasn't a far off from the average error rate. So what do you what do you want? So there's a lot of stuff, Like we said that there was a lot of post mortem that was done on the two thousand and sixteen polls and what what was gotten wrong and what was gotten right, And we'll talk about that later. But um, the point is is that overall it wasn't that far off. And so the the idea isn't that the polls failure, that there's something inherently flawed with polling, or that there's even something inherently wrong with the media. Like I want to go on record here, especially in this climate, the media is not our enemy. Like any healthy democracy needs a vital, robust, independent media is free from bias as an objective to reality and good injustice as possible. But there's also such a thing as a twenty four hour news cycle, and you've got to fill that. And that's given the rise of opinion news and pundits and um and basically trying to capture as much market share as possible, which is definitely the wrong track for media in general. But I just want to go on record, while we're gonna be kind of beating the media up a little bit, that does not mean that the media has inherently flawed or evil or or seeks to um to to kill you and your family and your family dog. So Silver goes back and a bunch of people go back and look at um history and kind of what went wrong here in as far as the polling goes. He says, you know what, we went back for the past twelve presidential cycles since nineteen seventy two, and he said the polling air was four point one. He said in that national polling air was three point one, so technically by a full point it was. It was a full point better. He said, Uh, we predicted that she would win the popular vote by three percentage points. She actually did win the popular vote by two percentage points. Um. The state polls were the real difference maker. They actually did underperform at a five point to error rate, and that doesn't sound like that much. I think the overall or rate for state poll since nineteen four point eight, so four point eight five point two doesn't sound like much. But if you're talking about a percentage of error and just a handful of swing states, that can make something look like a landslide even though you lose a popular vote. That's exactly what happened, right, That's exactly what happened, because you gotta remember Trump didn't win the popular vote, he won the electoral college, and it came down to those swing states. But the fact that they were off just by point four points from the average for the error rate um goes to show you just how close that race actually was, which again is the opposite of how it was being broadcast throughout the election. It was supposed to be a landslide, like Hillary Clinton might as well just be like taking measurements for curtains in the oval office right now, Like it was just that set So it was presented one way, when in reality, if you really looked at the polls and the polling results, if you looked at them with a sober face, it was a much closer race than it appeared or than it was being broadcast. I haven't had a sober face since that night. So, uh, we should talk about the margin of error. Um, in polling. Anytime you see a poll, it's you. They talk about the margin of air. It's usually plus plus or minus three or four, and that is on each side. So for each candidate's poll, uh. In other words, it could be a potential like seven to eight point swing and still be within that margin of error. So when Trump is winning States by a point two percent margin or a point five or a point seven percent margin, that's well, well well well within the margin of error, right right, So um, that margin of error, by the way, is just bill tim. We'll talk about it a little more and a little bit, but it's like there's just no way around it. If to to get around any margin of air, you would have to literally go through and interview every single voter in America and then compile the evidence or their their data perfectly without any miss keys or anything like that. And it's just impossible. So everyone accepts that any poll is going to have a margin error, but you want to keep it within plus or minus three points. Right be four. Yeah, So a little history of polling. Um, we've always been, um, pretty spell bound by poles in this country. We put a lot of stock and polls, especially the presidential race. Um. The word straw pole, if you've ever heard that, that comes from the idea that you hold up a piece of straw to see which way the wind is blowing. So a straw pole is kind of like, here's how things stand today on something like this is why the way the wind is blowing today on this matter. Yeah, and they're just kind of informal. They used to take them like on train cars, as journalists would ask people who they were on the train with, who they're going to vote for. Nothing like formal or anything, but it it was. It does kind of reveal how long standing our fascination with poles really really is. Yeah, it got pretty serious in the nineteen thirties, specifically the nineteen thirty six election, where a literary digest it was, it was a pretty big magazine at the time, pulled it's subscribers and it's just kind of funny even seeing this sence they predicted a landslide wind for Republican Republican alf landon over fd R. So if you've never heard of alf Landon, uh, you know I because alf Landon did not beat f DR. Uh. And the magazine's editor said, you know what, we didn't even think about the fact that we just pulled our subscribers and that they're wealthy people are at least wealthier on average, and they're probably going to vote Republicans. So um, alf Landon was their man. Right. So if you go out it's even today and just interview Republicans and say, hey, who you're going to vote for, and then take that results and apply it to the entire population of the nation, you've got a flawed pole. And that's what Literary digested. But in doing so, they established this kind of they pointed out a real design flaw that now is just one of the first basic things that anybody conducting a pole gets rid of. That's right. Gallup came on the scene. They galloped onto the scene. Uh so sorry, And they were one of the first big polling companies to say, all right, we gotta get this right. We gotta get a representation of all of America here. So we're gonna send our people door to door. We're gonna go to every zip code in America, and they did that from n to nineteen four UH and got basically within about three percentage points, doing a pretty good job. UM, but it was really expensive. So in the eighties, in the mid eighties, they switched to calling people on telephone, which which I mean that that's still today. That is the gold standard is for a human being to dial up another human being and ask them some questions. And we'll talk a little more about it. But what what Gallup does and what you does, and what a few others UM do is it's called randomized sampling or probability sampling, which is where you basically leave it to chance that any voter registered voter in America is going to get a phone call from you, So that what what Gallup is doing and what Pew does is called randomized sampling or probability sampling, where the any voter in America has an equal chance of receiving a phone call from Gallop or from Pew and being asked these questions. And it worked pretty well for a while when they moved from UH in person over to the phone, because they were still asking people questions and they could still UM get their answers and harass them, which is a big thing is we'll see about the this type of sampling. Um, the problem is when people started to use caller I D, they stopped picking up the phone as much, and so the response rate went down dramatic. Yeah, so they would call people using random digit dialing, which is a computer system where it fed in an area code and then the first three digits and then randomly dialed the last four. So you've got a pretty good start there on the random sampling. But even then they said, you know what, women tend to answer the phone more than men. So to truly randomize that whenever whoever picks up the phone, we have to then follow up and say we want to talk to the person in the house who's had the most recent birthday, further randomizing. Um. I got it kind of a laugh about this because I don't know that I've ever, literally ever seen my father pick up a telephone in his life, or at least growing up for the first eighteen years of my life, I don't think I ever saw him answer the phone. It's all ham radio, huh. Not not he went into that, but just literally not not one time. He would just let it ring. If no one was around if my mom wasn't around to answer it, and granted it was usually never for him, no one ever called to talk to him. But I picked up on that and my friends used to get really frustrated back before texting that I would just never answer my phone. And I always just thought it was an option, Like when the phone rings, it doesn't mean you're obligated. It just means now you have an option you can answer it or not. Well, technically that's true. I mean like it depends no, you don't have to answer the phone, but it depends on you know, who in your life could possibly be calling. I didn't think it was rude or anything. I just thought it was literally, like, you know, I'm gonna hedge my beds here, that one of my friends isn't stuck on the side of the road. They can leave a message and if they are, I'll go get them. So, UM, what you're talking about, Chuck, is what's called a non response, and that's factored into the response rate, which with phone pulling from nine the nine eight until the nineteen nineties, um it was manageable. You. I think the response rate peaked at thirty six percent in n which is good. Now it's down to like nine percent, because, like I said, people have callorad D and if some unknown numbers calling, you typically don't answer. And that actually affects things because there is a certain kind of person who answers the phone no matter what, and they are not like every single American, and that actually factors into the kind of pole you're connecting. Plus also you want like a certain amount of responses. I think out of a sample size, you want a minimum of eight hundred survey responses. And back in the day, when you got a thirty six percent response rate, meaning thirty six percent of those people you called would answer the phone and go through all of the questions and answer them fully and complete the survey. Um since it was down to nine percent, you went from having to call between two thousand people to to up to nine thousand people now just to get eight hundred surveys completed. And that made the whole thing a lot more expensive. On the one hand, because it was expensive, it meant that there were fewer and fewer companies that could conduct these polls, which meant the polls you were seeing were more and more legitimate. But on the other hand, it also UM usually decreased sample size a little bit, because, as as Gallup pointed out, like you can kind of fiddle with the numbers a little bit with a smaller response rate and smaller sample size. Yeah, and it also led to robo calls because of expense, because of people not answering their phone as much, and those systems. Uh. I mean, I love how Dave Ruce put it. He said they they range from okay to terrible, UM, and how well they work online polls in these other new techniques. But I think we should take a break and then talk about, uh what I found the very interesting UM way that they further randomized this thing from this point forward right after this. All right, so we've already talked about the fact that they randomly called someone, and then they take one further step on that that call by saying, let me speak with whoever had the most recent birthday, even if it's I guess you're your three year old, right, And and one other thing I kind of made mention to it that I have to interject, dude, like harassing people, like if you've been picked by this computer, if your phone number has been picked, they're going to keep calling you and calling you. And that is because, as a person who doesn't normally participate in phone surveys, you are a specific kind of person that you you can't be left out of the population because you represent a large number of people and they want your opinion. So part of this phone standard of calling people is to call them over and over and over again to basically harass them into participating to get their answers for this serve because it's as important, if not more important, sometimes than the people who are like, oh, yeah, I'd love to answer this phone survey. Two totally different kinds of people. Yeah. Absolutely. And I was totally kidding, by the way, to the listener when I said they will speak to a three year old. They they asked the most recent birthday of someone a voting age obviously, right. Um, So then you've got a pretty pretty decent random sampling to begin with. And then you have to start uh the process of waiting, uh, which comes in a lot of different forms. Um. If you want an example of like a really good political poll, it's gonna be paid for by a neutral source. It's not gonna be um like you know, a CNN pole or a Fox News poll or a superpack or anything like that. Um, you're gonna have a random sample of the public, which we just talked about. You're gonna be dialing cell phones and landlines these days. That's a big one. Also, they'll ask you if you have a cell phone and a landline, and if you say yes, I have both, they're going to adjust your response based on the fact that you had a higher chance of being selected because you have two numbers that the computer could have picked right. And another thing is, like you mentioned, they're gonna keep calling you the best ones, use live interviewers still. And then what they want to do, and this last one is really important, is you're they're gonna try and improve the accuracy of the results by waiting the response to match. What they want to do is just match a real world demographic, age race, your income level, your education level, and all of that stuff is factored in, and all the stuff is weighed out because, um, well we'll talk about it, but you know, there are many different kinds of Americans, and if you want a really good sampling of different kinds of Americans, you're gonna, like, like you said, I have to fidget with the numbers to make it a true representative population right. So, um, because even if you just get it exactly right demographically and waited, which, like you said, we'll talk about some more in a second, you still have that marge and of error. And again that's that um, you know, plus or minus three points, and that means that it could be cent or it could be they don't know, but somewhere between that, most of your answers are going to be the like, the correct answers somewhere in there. That's what that means with that that margin of error, And the reason that that's built in is because it is basically impossible to perfectly represent the larger population through random sampling. You're just not going to pick everybody correctly just by the fact that it's random and it's a sample. Yeah, and that's important because um, like that's why you hear so much hay being made over a double digit lead in a poll um, which Biden had sort of semi recently. I know it's it's gotten a lot tighter since then, but you know, when Biden was up by I think like ten percentage points, people were flipping out because you know, like we said, it's plus or minus four for each candidate. So that's a total of eight. And so basically the press start screaming like he's outside of the margin of error. Everybody like nothing can beat him, right right, yeah, But now things are back within that margin. I saw PBS News Our UM they interview Mark Shields and David Brooks. Um. Brooks is a New York Times columnists and I think Mark Shields is an independent columnist. And one of them actually said, and this is in July, America has clearly made up its mind on who's going to be the next president. And I was like, this is July. Did you not learn anything from two thousand and sixteen or you I couldn't believe that those words, And there's a matter of factly, yeah, it's irresponsible. And there's been studies about this too that have suggested that that words like that, that um polls that say chance of winning, that this kind of stuff like actually has a negative impact on the leader because it makes people think, well, I don't need to go out and vote. Everybody else is going to go vote, and the turnout might be lower than otherwise. There's also people that just who well, there's people who dispute that. They say, yes, it makes sense intuitively and anecdotally, but we've yet to actually see genuine data that that says clearly that this has this effect. But it's something that's still being studied right now whether it actually does or not well. And I also saw an article the other day about the the quote unquote silent majority, and that another reason those polls were so wrong back then and they're saying are probably wrong now is because there are there they They say that there's a substantial block of voters who vary privately and secretly vote for Trump. Yeah, they're the term for them among pollsters as shy Trump voters. They won't admit that they're going to vote for Trump, but they're going to vote for Trump, and that that affects polls. I saw that that's actually not been proven to actually exist. Um, but I think it was a Pew. There's a really great Pew article. If this stuff is speaking to you at all, go check out Pews Key Things to Know about Election Polling in the US and Now has a bunch of great links that you should follow in there. And there's also Sideline UM. They have Surveys and Polling, which is a guide for journalists to polling. But I I found out you don't actually have to be a journalist to read it online. So if you want to go check those out, they have some great like, um like just some breakdowns of some of the stuff we're talking about, but also about how to read polls and what to trust and look for in general. Uh. And then a little known fact, PEW was actually originally called uh pupu until six when Star Wars came out and they're like, we gotta change our name now, guys. Yeah, I can't do it, man, it is dant o rama today with you. Huh. So back to the waiting thing. Um. And by the way, we should mention that Gallup said if they wanted to um increase that sample size and actually get the margin of error down to like plus our minus two, that they could do that, but that would be like a literal increase in the cost. So like, everyone just please live with plus or minus three or four points. Yeah, and now everybody generally does. And and Dave uses this really good example. Dave Russ helped us out with this, and he said, um, this this margin of air is best understood where if you selected a hundred marbles UM five there's a jar five five hundred blue marbles, and you pick out a hundred of them. Um, you might pick out fifty of each one time. And then what he said, five hundred marbles. Oh no, I'm sorry, a thousand marbles. I've lost my marbles. Yes, there's a thousand marbles. Okay, five hundred are red and five hundred of blue. Your task, Chuck, is to pick out a hundred. So you go to the trouble picking out a hundred fifty or red, fifty or blue. And I say do it again, and this time is forty seven and fifty three, and keep saying again again, right, and I smack my riding crop on the desk. That's that you're sitting at times because you gets super turned on. Yeah, I did it a hundred times because dear leader told me to. And at the end you get a little bell curve and basically a plus or minus four. Right, So yeah, almost all of them, this is what's confidence involved. Almost all of them are going to fall in that bell curve. There's going to be some outler, it's just gonna be that one time where it was just absolutely insane. You actually picked one hundred red marbles randomly blindfolded from this jar that that's that's so insignificant statistically, it's just such an outlier. But almost all the we're gonna be in there. So when you're pulling like this large group of people, like American voters, and of them are falling within a couple of percentage points of either side of this this middle, you can pretty much feel confident about that. And that is the basis of of election polling, of political polling, of all polling, really that they have this built in margin that they know exists, but everybody can live with it. The problem is is when you're hovering around that fifty mark and you're talking about a two party system, one of them has like and the other one has but there's a plus or minus of like two points. It means we have no idea. And some people would say, well, why even do polling, because what you're showing there is not who's going to win. That's not the point of polling. But the point of polling is to take a snapshot of how America or whoever you're polling is feeling that moment about who to elect, about what laws to pass, about religion, about um. The Cleveland Indians. It doesn't matter, right, like the the the that's what a poll does. But you can pervert polls into making them talk a different language and say, hey, he look at this percentage. You take these polls and you convert them into something else. Now you have something like a chance this person is gonna win. Go shout that, Wolf Splitz heer, and Wolf Flitzer goes and shouts it as loud as he can. So, uh, we need to talk a little bit more about waiting. I mentioned earlier that there's other things they do to sort of, um tip the scale, and that sounds like a bad term, so I guess I shouldn't say it that way. But um things they do to make it equitable and a true representative of the American population. For instance, UM, African American voters make up twelve percent of voters. So if they did a poll and in the end they only got six percent of respondents so were African American, then they just double it. Basically, Um, if the respondents were overwhelmingly Caucasian, they would weight that down to their true representative number, which is about I think sixty six percent. Yeah, the electorate is white, and of U of white people respond or eight percent of the people that respond are white, then they're going to kick that down. And again, this is just adjusting the poll to the proper weight, so you have a really legitimate snapshot. And you know, if it sounds crazy that there using a thousand people's responses, uh and drawing that out to the size of the voting population of America, it is. But if you're a statistician, it isn't you know. I mean, you know, it reliably works as long as you present it with plus or minus this margin of error. Um, it's as crazy as just an average Joe on the street. It does to be like they ask a thousand people and we're supposed to know and extrapolate that, and a statistician who our number wants and data wants would say, yeah, that's exactly what that means. Shut up, that's really all. That's really all you need. But it really is a testimony to the power of those those statistics in that data and the analysis of them. Yeah, waiting is really important. It goes far beyond just like age political party. Um. I think gallup uses eight different variables. The New York Times see in a college poll uses ten, like and they include things like marital status and home ownership PU uses twelve variables. Um. They ask things like do you have home internet access? To you have volunteers or do you engage in volunteerism um, And all of these things have been owned to be associated. So like, if you're a white woman age sixty five to seventy five who volunteers twice a month and lives in the suburbs, you're a very specific person where you you there's a group of people out there who vote like a certain way, and you represent like all those people with that. So they they'll wait the results based on these additional questions that you're into. They don't just ask you do you are you going to vote for Trump or Biden? And there's also built into that question a really important point, are you going to vote? Yeah, that's a that's a huge thing we haven't talked about. It's one thing to pull registered voters. But here in America, somehow, uh, presidential elections only get about six turnout still, which is shameful, shameful and crazy. But um, that's another podcast. But uh so, most of the really really good polls drilled down and to get a real, real good representation of what might actually happen. They try to drill down to whether or not you're most likely to actually vote, because he cares what your pain is if you're not gonna vote, and they and I mean they generally take your word for it that you're telling the truth, you know. Um yeah, but they do have like nine I think pu Yeah, Pew has nine questions that they basically used to establish that you're you are planning on voting, like you're actually going to vote, You're not full of hot air, you know. Yeah. I don't know those questions are, but I imagine they have to do with do you know where you're pulling places? Do you have transportation? Stuff? Like I was thinking they were going to be like, are you really really gonna vote? Was like question three, and they just kept adding release right you So, um, So you've got these these people who have been called and they have answered these questions, and they have participated in this survey whether they wanted to or not, and they've they've finally done it. Built into that margin of error built into the poll. Is that understandable margin verror that just comes from the fact that it's a randomized sample, right, But what PE and any other legitimate UM group polling group will point out is that the margin is actually greater than that. That the margin of error for the average poll according to Pew, is that it's something more like six points, not not three or four, it's actually six. And the reason why it's built on top of that margin of error that's that's automatically part of the poll just by the virtue of it being a randomized sample. Are things like the person typing in the wrong key accidentally that those kind of things add up, or that the question isn't worded clearly enough that anybody who hears it knows the intent and knows what their answer is, that there's some sort of um miscommunication involved. There's also things that they can't control, for like people who have pseudo opinions who don't want to sound dumb, so they just answer yes or no by sense something they really don't care about either way UM and because they don't actually have an opinion, that actually that that waits things the wrong way. So when you add all these stuff these things up, UM, you have these additional um uh errors that lead to different to like a bias overall in in the the UM the poll, which can affect the outcome. But again, the companies that have the money to conduct like these genuinely big gold standard polls, are they they know enough to know how to kind of factor control for those as much as possible. But still, what Pew says is, if you're listening to a poll and somebody says plus or minds three points, you should probably go ahead and double that in your mind, double it in your mind, double your W, your pleasure wr fun W, your margin error. So let's take a break and we're gonna come back and talk about what exactly they think went wrong with those state polls right after this, Sorry, George, all right, So I think it's generally acknowledged that the um and again I want to say the polling was was off, but apparently the pulling wasn't off, but the way it was reported on was off. But what really happened in seen what was off was the state polling, and what they think they've, like you said, gone back and obsessed over these polls since then, um, you know, because they were already statistical walks, but when something like this happens, they really sort of get worked into a dander and get to the bottom of it. I mean people were calling for the end of polling. She said it was a failed profession. Basically, he was like, I'm getting rich off this man. Yeah, we can't end polling. Jimmy Pugh was like, stop stop talking like that. So what happened in is uh they think is that uh, a lot of non educated white people came out in big, big numbers for Donald Trump. And that was a sort of a new not a new factor because they had always talked about college education, but a new factor in how outsized of a factor that was. It had never been that outsized. And so all these state posters they didn't wait it and they didn't adjust their polls to reflect this um fact that college educated people are more likely going to respond to these surveys. So their polls were just off. Yeah, and they knew that college educated people were more likely to respond to the survey. That wasn't news to them. What caught them sleeping was that they had not picked up on the fact that this group of people, um, non college educated white voters, We're going to go to the polls in numbers like never before, and that they were going to vote for Trump. They did not pick up on that that was brand new, like that didn't exist before. Trump basically brought up a new electorate that helped get him elected, especially in battleground states like Wisconsin, in Michigan, uh, in Indiana, although I think in the enda he was a shoeing because of pens. But the the these this group of voters that did not exist, with this line between college educated and non college educated white voters, that that partisan gulf hadn't existed before election day. The pollsters didn't pick up on it, and so they didn't wait those responses because they never had to wait the responses before based on college education. Yeah, so suburb exurbs and especially the rural vote counted like it had never counted before. UM, which is obviously why you see what's going on right now, like a very hard pushed by the Trump campaign to um to get these the same people out again. Uh and in the way that they do that that is the nicest way I can put it there, genuinely is so UM. Yeah. So the idea that that there was all this was already kind of a close race, a closer race than was being broadcast. UM, that these these electoral um, huge electoral battleground states that got flipped. Uh. That was basically the reason that UM Trump was able to take the electoral College. But the the idea is that these voters kind of came out of nowhere and voted for Trump, and that there were some other things that happened to UM that the pollster didn't anticipate. One that the undecided voters, people who said I'm legitimately undecided at this point a week before the election, Uh, from whatever, they broke hard in favor of Trump. On election date when they made their decision, they voted for Trump that hadn't been predicted. Um. That was another big one. And then one of the other things too, is that the polls were just doing what polls do, which is sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong. But polls had gotten so good in the two thousand oughts that people came to to be overconfident in their ability to predict and pick winners. And the two thousand and sixteen grates reminded us, like, polling is not perfect, let's stop pretending it is. Yeah, and it's UM. A lot of it has to do with, like we've been kind of harping on the way the media presents it. And then a lot of that has to do with just our conditioned how we're conditioned to look at things like underdogs. Um, and it's different in politics. And I remember when these aggregators, especially at five thirty eight, Uh, they had these predictive models, and they started talking about the fact that and I think the Washington Post even wrote a good comparison to sports. And you know, if someone has a is a real big underdog going into like a super Bowl or a World Series and they end up winning, people don't get angry and go after the people who said they had a fifteen or twenty percent chance of winning. They just said, wow, what a story, the underdog one. But there are so few presidential elections, uh, you know, one every four years that it's it's the same thing, but people just look at it differently. Like an underdog like Trump was an underdog that supposedly had like a fifteen to thirty percent chance of winning. Some people said, one, yeah, well that's ridiculous, But a thirty percent chance of winning is a real shot at winning, for sure. Yeah, that's the way it's framed. It doesn't seem that way in politics, no, And so that's one thing. But another thing is that we shouldn't even be talking about president vential elections with like chance of winning, chance of winning like that is not how we should present it. We and that's not how we used to present it. We used to present it saying like this poll found that, um, that Clinton was going to lead Trump of forty eight percent or something like that, plus or minus two points, and that would have shown you like, Okay, well this is a really close race, way closer than I think, um. And that's that there's my information. Not The problem is that you can take that same statistic chance of winning plus or minus of four point um margin of error. If you convert that to a normal distribution, you come up with a probability of a win. That's the problem is that the statistics that are being being the data that's being produced by these polls, are being converted in ways that they shouldn't be, and then that's what the media jumps on. That's what the public lapse up because that is the horse race statistic, and eighty four percent chance of winning, a fifteen percent chance of winning, that's what we we think about. That's what we look at. And so rather than realizing that actually this is a close race plus or minds four points, we see eighty four percent chance of winning, and that's a foregone conclusion that that person is going to win. That's that, ultimately is where the media and the public are culpable for this. Yeah, I don't think uh, I don't think they were meant to be extrapolated like that to begin with. And that you know, polls are valuable, but like, I haven't looked at any polls, and partially because of the way went down. Um And in fact, for the past week, I've taken a complete uh internet news and social media break and it's been pretty great actually because yeah, I mean I literally haven't looked at a single news thing. Very sadly found out that Chadwick Boseman passed away like three days after word. Like that's how how dark I've gone, uh, and not looking at the Internet unless it's something that brings me joy, which is to say, you know, old led Zeppelin and Van Halen YouTube videos. I was looking up classic Mad magazine covers of the eighties. That's all I've been doing is if it doesn't bring me joy on the internet, I'm not doing it. Um. And you know, I gotta break that soon, because I do think you should be active and involved in in in the know. But yeah, but taking a break fairly regularly is definitely mentally healthy. But that aside, I haven't I'm not looking at any polls and I don't care what any poll says. We'll see. So I was I was thinking very similar stuff too, and um, like, what what's the point of poles? Okay, well I finally found it. If you look that up on Google, there's there's just very little on it. But I found somebody who who explained it pretty well. I thought that, Um, poles aren't meant to tell you who's going to win. They're not. They're not forecasting models, like I said before, They're to be like a snapshot of how whoever you're polling feels at the moment right um. And in doing that, because you are sampling American people and these are independent news organizations typically who are carrying out these these polls, you get to tell everybody else how America is feeling. Rather than the leaders saying I'll decide how you're feeling. I can decide what you want and what you need and what you think is important. Polls prevent that from happening by telling the rest of the people, Hey, this is how everybody else is feeling right now too. And in some ways it is kind of sheepish, where you know, the ideas like, oh, you know, is that supposed to sway my opinion that everybody's going to vote for this person and not for that person. That should have no bearing or impact on your vote, And it feels like that that's how polls are used sometimes. But if you step back and look and see that they're actually kind of an important part of of sharing what other people are thinking, rather than being told what we're thinking or you know, what, what to think, then they actually are pretty legitimate in that sense. Yeah, well, you know, I say, take your polls and sit on it. Well, one more thing we get. We cannot talk about polling and not talk about Internet polling real quick. This is a completely different style of polling than's ever been done before. Rather than a randomized sample, you actually just say hey, you want to take the survey, and people click it. So it's called opting in opt in surveying, and very specific kinds of people take surveys on purpose on the Internet, so they really are because they're new. They're really now figuring out how to wait these things are not UM and how to how to use them because they can produce legitimate UM data, but it depends on who's conducting the poll, how if they know what they're doing, that kind of stuff. But just like everything else that the moving things online is democratize polling, and so anybody can conduct a poll now and basically enter the news cycle. That's how Kid Rock almost became a senator in Michigan for a second there. But so on the one hand, it's good, but it's also we're in a big period of disruption as far as polling is concerned. So for you, the polling consumer, either go like Chalk and just stop listening to polls altogether, or UM look for things like transparency. Do you recognize the company or the name that produced the poll. Are they sharing their data, like how the questions exactly were worded, what their population size was, how they waited at all this stuff? UM, if the if there's all, if all that stuff is included, you can probably trust the poll. And then UM, beyond that, just remember what you're looking at that this isn't a predictor of who's gonna win. It was a snapshot for a very very brief moment of a very specific sample of America to just to show how people would vote right then. And it was right then too. This is not election day we're talking about. Yeah, And I'm you know, I want to be clear. I'm not poopooing polls. I just uh, they're they're valid and useful, but I just don't care to look at them right now. I understand. Yeah, that's that's my jam. Well, you got anything else about polls, nothing else about powells. Well, if you want to know about polls, uh, start looking around and you go check out Pew stuff and uh sidelines stuff and all that stuff. Um. And since I said stuff three times here it comes from will stillt Kid or a candy man. So, uh, this is from Keiley Price. And Keily says this, Hi, guys, I'm writing today not only to confess my unending love for stuff you should know, but also to share a link to some black owned bookstores. It would be so cool if all of your listeners purchased your book. She should just say period. Uh. Comma from a black owned bookstore couldn't agree more. By the way, a couple of podcasters that I listened to while I wait for stuff. You should know have books out and coming out soon, and they encourage their listeners to support black owned businesses through the purchase of their book to win Win. I don't know why it's taking me so long to think to write this to you guys. I blame it on Corona madness. But last, but not least, I'll say I love the End of the World with Josh Clark and movie Crush as well. Any chance to hear you guys talk as a chance worth taking. When we get a COVID vaccine and you guys can do your live shows again, please come to Nashville. Oh yeah, for sure. I think we planned on Nashville.

To lose my mind if I got to see you guys here all the best, Keiley Price and so. Keiley sent a link to a handy website that lists black owned bookstores near you. I made a little uh you are else shortener to make it easier on everyone. Oh, let's have it so you can go to bit dot lee slash s y s k b l m uh and find black owned bookstores near you to purchase Stuff you Should Know, an incomplete compendium of mostly interesting things at the very least. Um, we like to kurch people to go to indie bound dot org and support indie bookstores. I don't know if there is an actual black owned indie bookstore website, but I would imagine most of the black owned bookstores are indie bookstores. Uh yeah, probably, So check it out. Bit dot lee slash s y s k v l M. Go out and buy our book. Everybody. You're gonna love it. It's really great, m um, and thanks thanks for that, Chuck, and thanks for setting us up for that too, Kiley, much appreciated. We'll see you in Nashville.
