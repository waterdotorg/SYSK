Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve Camray. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should Know? From House Stuff Works dot Com. Sometimes science goes too far, dog matters twisted but true. Wednesday's at ten on Science. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant. Say, hey, Chuck, Chuck. That makes the stuff you should know. It's such an old joke. Yeah, terrible, It's still It's got a lot of little staying power and little else. It has as much staying power as cat urine. Chuck, you want to hear the history of the microwave? Woman? I love in forty seconds or less? All right back in, a guy named Percy Spencer was touring the labs of the Raytheon Corporation when he passed by a magnetron. If he had unpopped popcorn in his pocket, then I'm leaving right now. We'll get to that. That doesn't count against my forty second I thought, like popcorn popped in his pocket? No, he had a chocolate bar in his pocket and it melted, And he's really, what the hell is going on here? So he actually ran and got a bag of popping corn and it started popping too. And then he finished the whole thing off spectacularly by getting a pot and a raw egg and holding it near the magnetron, and it exploded into his buddy's face. Anyway, he figured out he was producing microwaves. No, he lived to be an old man, but he figured out that this was producing microwaves, and he um put it in an invention. So everybody has a microwave oven today has a tiny magnetron in their house. He put it in an invention. Yeah, that's a unique way of saying that look good for him. Yeah. Anyway, the point of this is that that's the Raytheon Corporation where it's this discovery was made. And the Raideon Corporation was largely a government funded outfit, so we would call that a government experiment of sorts. It's not the craziest though, Chuck, Not not even close. No, you want to talk about some crazy government experiments, maybe five of them today. It sounds like a great idea. All right, let's do it, man. This is written by Robert Lamb with stuff from the science Lab we should point out. Yeah, I hope we're not stealing this article. Is here gonna do this at some point I didn't even ask him. I'm sure that he wanted to. It's too late now, which it was the first one here, Josh about transplanting heads onto other bodies, let's talk about that. Yeah, because think about it, Chuck, think about the applications of this. I mean, like, technically, if you don't look at it as a head transplant, you can make the case that this is a full body transplant. Appere's on if you're the chicken or the egg. I guess it definitely definitely makes sense a little. We'll find out when the people right in um the but this is something that we could definitely use if we could attach the spinal cord. Uh yeah, I cannot. Is that the thing that's holding it back? Well, that's the thing that keeps the result from being a quadriplegic. Oh what they said that applications. Maybe if someone just wants to live, they'd rather live as a quadriplegic than die. Yeah, okay, especially if you're already a quadriplegic and you're used to it, but you have oregan failure. Hey, that's pretty random. But I let's think about it. We talked about brail. What if you are blind and handless. I guess you used it that e readers that read things to you out loud, Chuck. This idea of full body transplantation does have its roots in government experiments, specifically as far back as night when a US surgeon named Charles Guthrie decided that he wanted to find out if he could put one dog's head on another dog's body. And by god, Chuck Bryant has a picture of it, the two headed dog. Yeah, he actually did this, and it was not replacing one head with another like you said. He he attached a dog's head and underneath the chin of the other dogs, so they were in fact chinna chin, and the other dog was like going right. So you actually did this, and I don't know if you want to say it worked because the second head could only um lawl about. Yeah. They said that there were some um, just normal um reflex reactions and and sounds, but not dog type sounds. Yeah. It couldn't fetch the paper or anything. Right. Yeah, so uh, I guess you could make the case though, that that was successful. At the very least, they got a pretty cool picture out of it. Well, blood flowed from one head to the other, through the brain and then back out. So that's pretty cool. It worked in a way. You're gonna post that pick on the blog. So that was the first one. That's nineteen o eight. That's pretty old timey, right indeed. And then we cut to nineteen fifty one when the Soviets are saying, oh, the Americans are doing it, well, well you gotta do it too. There was a lot of that going on back then. There really was, UM And actually before that, there was an experiment in the forties, right right, This thing is on YouTube. If you type in experiments in the Revival of Dead organisms, you're going to find a nineteen forties UM instructional film esque film like that UM that shows people killing dogs and reviving them and apparently, well it's not very graphic. It's more like, here, have some cyanide dog, and then they bring the dog back. UM. Also supposedly, if you can just barely see it, that it's a dog's head that's moving and like responding and everything, but it's being kept alive externally through like an artificial heart and lungs, pumping blood into the brain and back out for circulation. I don't need to see that. They don't show a good shot of it, so it's possible it's a trick. But I was reading a post on it that showed that this stuff was real. They actually did kill this dog and revive. It was very scientific. It wasn't a joke or a hoax. Um, so we have been able to was that Vladimir was that someone else? I think it was Vladimir because it was the Soviets. He was a sick puppy. He was, yes, And speaking of puppy, he did the same dog thing where he would He transplanted twenty puppy heads with head, shoulders, lungs, four limbs, and an esophagus that emptied outside of the dog, transplanted them onto other dogs, and some of them live. One lived as long as twenty nine days, and they actually uh, there's some log notes here. Nine am Donor's head eagerly drank water or milk and tugged as if trying to separate itself from the recipient's body. And one of them bit one of the staff members, which was my favorite part. And one of them bit the other dog on the ear, and the dog tried to shake it off, so they were actual dog things happening. Yeah, that's pretty puppy esque. Yeah, and awful, this six sickens. I didn't eve want to talk about this really sick, yeah, really dead on the other dolphins. It's like the cutest horrific experiment ever. The only way it could be cuter is if they transplanted unicorn heads. There were pictures of this by that I couldn't even go there, well, chuck. This horrible type of experimentation culminated in nineteen seventy when an American nerves surgeon named Robert J. White transplanted the living head of one monkey onto the headless body of another, and it worked, and he was almost bitten by the monkey. That's how they considered as a success. Apparently everybody in the lab cheered when the monkey tried to bite the guy. And then after a week they put it down. So good for these crazy, crazy people. And meanwhile, um, of course the Soviets and the Americans were shooting chimps into space. They're gonna return again, and you know they're up there still little chip bodies or bounds probably at this point in some in space capsules. Well, you have to wonder, I mean, what kind of process of physics called degradation does a monkey undergo after death in space? I don't know, Answer me, I don't know. All right, let's move on, chuck to acoustic kitty. Yeah there animal abuse, Well it actually is. And um this was courtesy once again of the Cold War, the US and Soviet superpowers battling each other for position, and the c i A spent maybe as much as twenty million, at least ten millions. Yeah, so let's just settle in fifteen and five years and five years to implant uh listening devices into a cat, complete with battery and an antenna in the tail. Little kitty, Acoustic kitty is what they called it, and it was a single cat. They were they were. They alternately surgically outfitted it with UM eavesdropping devices and tried to train it because think about it, the presence of a cat is not the most you know, cats wander into places, they kind of go wherever they want, so it makes kind of it makes sense. The logic is there to an extent. But apparently the cat was just a little too willful for this. Um. They figured out that it went off and just kind of left whenever it got hungry, so they tried to um surgically manipulate um it's it's sense of hunger so it wouldn't get hungry as often. And then finally chuck it threw itself under a cab. Well you know why why it was It was the Kitty Acoustic Kitties first test mission. They they sent the little kitty on its first eavesdropping mission to eaves drop on these two Russian men in a park, really in a public park, and so they dropped the cat off and then that's when the cat ran from the cab and got killed, which is not funny at all. It's been to watch a cat get hit by a car, but imagine a ten million dollar cat that you spent five years training get hit by a car and its first mission. That's the part that I think was funny. It was the egg on the face of the US government, and there was egga plenty, and they kept it under wraps until two thousand one when that stuff was declassified but still partially censored. I read part of it. It's you know, all the fun words are blanked over right, you know, like who was doing it? Actually, there was one part left in their CIA officer Victor Marcetti. He addressed the hunger thing. He said, they put in a wire to thwart the hunger. I don't even know what that means. Yeah, I don't. I read that as well, and I don't know how you would do that, I mean, keeping grilling out. I have no idea. Probably so also awful because it involves animals, Chuck, Josh, have you ever heard of zero point energy? I have had you before today. No, I hadn't either. What is that, Josh? So from what I can gather, it's a it's a something that comes out of quantum mechanics. It's not supposed to happen under classical physics, but in quantum physics it does apparently innate energy that a particle has, even after all other external energies are removed right saying in a vacuum um. So they figured out that this means that particles have innate energy. But one of the um I guess more surprising aspects of reducing a particle to zero point energy is that they kind of come in and out of existence randomly, which is not supposed to happen, but apparently this is. It is especially susceptible to it when you completely remove gravity. Right, And this pursuit, the pursuit of figuring out how to use zero gravity machines to wink things in and out of existence was supposedly a Nazi experiment, huh. Right, And the Nazis were famous for many many odd, unproven, unsubstantiated experiments that they may or may not have conducted. Yeah, this one was real. The Nazi Bell, that's what they called it. Yeah, that's what Dr Cook called it. Yeah. And Dr Cook is Nick Cook, right, the Jane's Defense Weekly editor who kind of went off the deep end. I wrote a book review on Salon of his book, and it's you know, he's he's a very very respected journalist. Um, but he really got into conspiratorial world with this one. Yeah. He wrote the book The Hunt for Zero Point, where he broke it all down basically and alleged that this all happened. And he's not some crackpot, or he wasn't at the time, right, No, So he was, he was, you know, a respected, respected dude. What he believes is that an s S officer in charge of the V two rocket program, which eventually got the U S to the Moon, because don't forget we under operation or Project paper Clip, we UM drafted tons of Nazi scientists, including Werner von Brown who got us to the Moon. Yeah. Yeah, and uh, apparently the guy who was running the V two rocket program UM traded this information about zero gravity or zero point energy to the US. And uh, Cook's hole point is that some guy comes up with this real method of using an anti gravity machine, uh for military application, and he, I guess came up with a file from UM someone in the Defense department saying there's no real scientific or there's no military application here. So Cook's premise was there. Totally was, and they wouldn't have said that if they didn't already know how to do it, of course, So he was saying that we knew how to do that, and that the whole Foo fighter phenomenon, UFOs sightings, all that is evidence of us having figured out zero point gravity? How about that? And I did a little extra digging around and I found out there's this guy named Tim tim Bentura and he runs something called American Anti Gravity and he claims this is five years ago. And as usual, when you when you can't find follow up info, it's usually not a good sign. But he claims five years ago that a fellow named John Dearing of s A r A, the Scientific Applications and Research Associates, who actually have a lot of government contracts, are not crack pops either. They supposedly replicated key elements of the Nazi bell technology anti gravity propulsion, and they supposedly recreated this like five years ago, and they were looking for funding and uh, we're too secretive to get the funding that they needed, and it's it was kind of up in the air. Last I checked from from what I understand, and I don't know if it's necessarily zero point gravity, but using quantum mechanics, people have figured out how to get discs to levitate. So I mean, it's not without it's not outside of the realm possibility. He's got stuff on the YouTube, does he? Yeah? But so does David Blaine. He's a big phony. What No, Josh, he doesn't levitate. It's a trick. What let's talk about sex, baby in space? Yeah, sex in space. They have researched this um behind closed doors, obviously, although NASA says that they've never done such a thing, but clearly they have because they want to colonize the Moon in space one day, and you know you gotta know everything. Remember we talked about well the doom state, lunar doomsday ark safe humanity, that they were going to have their sexy business up there if they had to wait a century. Stephen Hawking said, it's essential for human survival. It depends on being able to appropriate in space. Okay, in space. I was gonna say, you don't have to be Stephen Hawking to realize that you gotta reproduce or else the species dies out right, no matter whether we're here in orbit or on the Moon or on Mars or wherever. Right. So, yes, of course NASA would engage in this kind of stuff. Specifically, there was a guy named Pierre Kohler. He was a French astronomer. Uh. And he wrote a book in two thousand called The Last Mission, and he said that four years earlier NASA um checked out ten different zero gravity um sexual positions on a mission. NASA says no, and and Pierre Cohler was like and pretty, yeah, you're on Earth. I'll tell you some pictures later. Uh. And obviously, like everything else's, Soviets have done the same with her cosmonauts supposedly, uh, cosmonauts. No the uh what the research into sex with the type of sexual positions? Oh, I don't know. Human docking procedures. Well that's what Robert called it. I think he put it in quotes. I thought that Many is just making a ride joke. We'll have to ask him. Yeah, but I love that human docking procedure. Uh. Russia Russian cosmonaut Valentia Valentina Tereshkova got pregnant nineteen seventy four by another cosmonaut, So there were some that said this was probably a maybe not done in space, but done just to see, like set up to see what would happen, like has his sperm been affected, has her uterus been affected? Whatever? But it all turned out fine. Their baby was completely normal, right, So that's a good sign. And some wonder if possibly that union was in a science experiment in and of itself just to find out. Um. But yeah, we have such a little grasp on what the effects of zero gravity have on the human body exactly that I mean, it's a worthwhile look, it could be a sperm killer, who knows, it could do all sorts of crazy stuff like remember the uh Sarcopenia episode where the neurons, the type of neurons that die off and are replaced or taken over by the other type of neurons happens the opposite the astronauts who have been in zero gram and it does here on Earth. Who would expect that? Sure, so you got it tested out. Have you heard of the two suit? No, it's a number two suit. This I don't know why it was invented by an actress and poet, but it was. Her name is Vana Bonta, and she invented the suit that basically keeps two people attached. You can put two suits together, if you know what I'm saying, to make one suit, and there's zippers and there's velcro, and there's openings and there's places to go cool within this suit, and each one has this sigrette tucked into like exactly the arm. And the idea is to stabilize human proximity so you can stay attached without much effort, so you can save your effort for coitus. Are they I don't know if you can buy them, and I don't know if the government said, hey and give me some of those two suits, But I mean it sounds like they gave us tang. Yeah exactly. So let's get get the two suits out there, and let's get to the last one, shall we, Buddy the Psychic Cold War? Yeah, did you see Men Who Stic Goats? I love that movie. I didn't see it. I loved it. It got like a forty seven percent pretty much across the board, like half and half. It was a good movie. Was it based on this or was it just fanciful goings on of George Clooney? No, there was your I'm writing a blog post on this today. There really was a programs that this thing was kind of based on. The characters were based on real life people. Um. Yeah, I'll show it to you. So we're talking about his psychic spies, right, Yeah, one, they're they're both the Soviets and the Americans were engaged in paranormal research. Um. This the Soviets since the twenties, um, and then the US and the forties or fifties was like, oh, we better catch up with this, and never did. They're reading our minds, so we need to read their minds exactly. Um. And there's a ton of applications for this. For the military lecture, for example, if you're manning a submarine and you can't surface, why don't you just send whatever information you need using your mind and the mind of somebody else, or why I get out of bed. Yeah, that's what I would do if it's a great one to just beat my messages everywhere. UM a man machine interface where we could UM basically psychically link ourselves to a computer to interact with it, uploaded download data. So does this stuff work though, Josh, I don't know. Is it real? It's real that they did the research. They definitely did do the research, and in nineteen seventy three, the Rain Corporation was asked to create a brief study on who was doing better at it, and the Rain Corporation said the Soviets big time. The Soviets were much more UM investigatory with the biological, the physiological aspects of this the basis of it, whereas with Americans it was UM psychology. All psychological based UM theory and practice were kept separate with America. In in UM the Soviet study, they came up with theories and then tested them like it was really scientific. So if anybody was going to get anywhere with it, the Rancorporation concluded that it was definitely going to be the Soviets. Well, good for the riskies. Yeah, they they still are. Yeah, and you know we had Operation or Project Stargate going until n so that was it. Well that's remote viewing basically. And at one point, Operation Stargate had twenty two active military and or private remote viewers on staff. That's pretty cool. I wonder how much that pays remote viewing a bit. It pays pretty good. Especially, I'll bet you can pretty much demand whatever salary you want. It's like, oh yeah, we'll go higher somebody else. Boy got downother home depot. Those guys hanging up front, see if they can remote view for you. Well that's about it for crazy government experiments. I think there's probably a ton more on the site though. You know obviously the c i A experimented with LSD. Buddy. Yeah, well that's number one on our list. That's why I got a whole podcast that one. Um. All you have to do is type maybe government and experiments in the handy search bar at how stuff works dot com, and that leads us to listener mail. Josh got a couple of quick ones today. Okay, this one is from Sasha a k a. Sparky and Sasha Sparky says a recent podcast mentioned pika and that's when you eat things that aren't food, and it reminded me of my own five year old cravings. As a young girl, I had an insatiable craving from match heads. Huh. Yeah, sulfur huh. I guess so I would bite down on the matches and scrape off the heads and eat them. And I kept a secret stash of Pilford matches under my pillow. I just think remember the salty sulfurus flavor and chalky texture. I'm not sure anyone of my family caught on, and I apparently outgrew it eventually. I'm not sure if this is a unique pike of craving or not. I just thought i'd share it from Sasha Sparky a k a. The match eater. Maybe that's why she's sparky. Either that or her love of sulfur just developed into a love of arson. And this one is from Tony and you're gonna like this one. Don't know if you actually read this? Uh one? Am Tony Rhotas. He's a business director for Gamma Vacuum, and he says guys, just thought you might like to know that I am sending an email from a hotel in Geneva, Switzerland, and have a couple of meetings tomorrow. It's cern awesome trying to sell them our vacuum pumps. Basically, the large had drink a lighter. Guys. He's a traveling vacuum salesman and he just said he wanted to know that one of he has a traveling vacuum salman. He said, he just wanted to let us know that one of the stuff you should know, Army foot soldiers is on the premises conducting business. Good for him, Thank you tone me, and then he sent back a follow up email after emailed him and said that he wants Jerry to say hi, and she refuses, but he requests it is it against religion? I would respect that, but out of my own self interest and not to look like a jackass. I'm not sure what that means. And uh, that's pretty much it. Maybe a horse whinny a sound effect. Just to know that she's there, is what he says. Jerry's going with the against her religion thing. It looks like okay, se remains mute. That coupled with a good horse whinny will get your places. Nay? Is that a good horse whinny? Yes, and it's actually amish for no. Are there questions that should not be asked, experiments that should not be performed, doors that should remain forever closed.
