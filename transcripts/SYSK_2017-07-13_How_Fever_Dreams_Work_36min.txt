Josh: Hey, everybody, stuff you should know is going on tour. Do do do one of the deeds, my friend. Okay, So starting August eighth in Toronto, that's in Canada. We're gonna be at dan Fourth Music Hall. And then Chicago, we're gonna be there the next night, August nine, at the Harris Theater at Chicago. We want to see your faces. Step it up, Step it Up. Vancouver or the Vote Theater September. That's gonna be a great show, I think, don't you. It's gonna be a great of one. And then in Minneapolis at the Pantageous Theater where we've been before. It's lovely September. Yeah, and then we're gonna swing down to Austin. It's gonna be during Austin City Limits, although it has nothing to do with Austin City limits. Will be there October ten, yes, and then we're going to Lovely Lawrence, Kansas go Jayhawks, yeah on October eleventh. And hey, if you're in Kansas City or anywhere in that area, this is your chance. Get in your car. Yeah. Uh, if you are anywhere near Brooklyn, well then you should go to the Bellhouse October. Will be there all three nights, and finally, we're gonna wrap it up here in Atlanta at the Bucket Theater on November four for a benefit show where we are donating all of the money's to Lifeline Animal Project of Atlanta and the National Down Syndrome Society. Yep. So for all this information again visually and for links two tickets, just go to s y s K Live dot com. Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from House Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. How are you? I'm Josh Clark, There's Charles W. Chuck Priyant, There's Jerry. Jerry's got a salad. Everything is normal, which means it's time. There's stuff you should know. That's right, Jerry's got the schwarmest special she said, Oh really, yeah, she loves it. How you doing. I'm good man, feeling despite myself kind of relaxed. Okay, I'm not feeling feverish. If that's what you're driving at. No, that's not what I was driving at. Uh yeah, no I'm not. Do you get fevers a lot? No, not anymore. Although I haven't for a long time, like I've never been like a fever person. I've probably had like a handful. Maybe. How many fevers have you had? Not a ton since I was a kid. Yeah, not a lot of adult fevers. I mean I've had like, uh, hip hop fever, rock and roll fever, yellow fever. I've had the fever for a flavor of a pringle. Oh Man, me too. What are those? Those aren't even potato chips? Are they? Their potato crisps? And those are good. They're mashed together potato parts. I don't think I want to know how those are made. No, it's like chicken McNuggets. I think a unicorn just poops them out. Have you seen unicorn pizza? It's a little much. There's a restaurant in New York, I'm not quite sure where, maybe lowery Side. They have unicorn pizza. It's like um dough okay, good start um, like a nice pestel colored frosting instead of sauce. UM, A mound of cotton candy, um, nerds or pop rocks maybe um, and then some other stuff. Supposedly it tastes kind of good. I'll eat anything that has enough frosting on it. I like frosting, but I'm not into like sugary candies. Really like nerds. And pop rocks and stuff. You know, I did a brain stuff once on pop rocks and that was interesting. Yeah. Yeah, your tongue actually warms the pop rocks to the point where they melt. And since they have C O two trapped inside during the manufacturing process, that c O two suddenly is released in a pop So it's just a little bubble of C two. That's gotta be good for you. I'm sure it's funny. My head of roommate in college, like, not many adults eat candy, Like people eat chocolate and stuff like that, candy bars, but candy candy, I don't know when adults is just a little strange. Yeah, do be candy? Sure? Like what mentos? Not mint mentos? Like candy mentos. I like those. Well. I had a roommate that would go to the convenient store next and this is college granted, but he still eats the stuff, I think, and he would go with like fifteen dollars and buy you know, like giant sweet tarts. You know it's big chewable ones and like uh, fun dip and nerds and just all kinds of candy fun dip, remember liquor made there's the same thing I think, Yeah, it's just right, Like I don't have a foot, but I've got my Lika made. Oh man, can you can you guys out there in podcast lantel over stalling because we are big time, because we happened upon a topic that no one really knows what's what? Yeah, I mean we're talking about fever dreams. We know about fevers, yep, kind of know about dreams, but apparently no one's really gotten to work on figuring out what fever dreams themselves are. So it's largely anecdotal. Yeah, so you're gonna have to bear with us something. We'll leave it. We'll leave that there for now. But I guess a good place to start is by talking about both those things separately. Uh, and starting with fevers. You know you've always heard ninety eight point six fahrenheit is the normal internal body temperature of human um. That in that was a big study that that is really ninety eight point two what um, depending on like how old you are, what time of day it is, what you're doing where you If you put it in your butt or in your under your armpit, or in your mouth or in your ear, or all of them at once, that'd be something else. Uh, it can vary a little bit. So I think there is a bit of a slight sliding scale to that number. Yeah, for sure. But I think the key is is it's going to be roughly around there. And even if you have an average body temperature that's not exactly ninet eight point six, let's say you typically tend towards five run cooler. Yeah, your body temperatures still during the average day gonna fluctuate plus or minus about a degree fair height either way. Yeah, So I looked a little bit into the ninety eight point six and the original um dude that came up with that was a a German physician named Carl Reinholdt August Vondelick. That was good, a good one. When eight sixty eight he wrote a book, Well he did his studies where he had this temperature rod he would stick under the armpits of all these people. He's like, where do you want that exactly? And everyone went said, everyone always says, you know the comedian Rory Scoville, No, he should just check him out. He does these weird things, like he'll just do his whole routine with the German accent, like for no reason, whatsoever. I like the sound of that. And he did one about stealing old people, like kidnapping old people. For the German accent. He's from South Carolina, I think, but he's done shows with like a severe Southern accent and one just normal accent, and he'll do a German thing. He just like people, I guess. So he's great. He's one of my favorites. So anyway, UM sixty eight he wrote a book called after these experiments, called doshen Elkin Pharma and kind can Heighten. And I looked at It's funny. The real translation I think of that is on the temperature in diseases, but if you type in Google Translate, it comes out as the behavior of the intrinsically warm in sick units. That's the subtitle. Yeah, So anyway, he's a guy that came up with ninety eight point six and that stood for a long time. But that's just so that was just based on his observations, his study, and it's stuck. It was an average. It wasn't like this is what you should be. It was just the average of all these people. And then hundred thirty years later we finally got around to verifying whether that was actually true or not. Well, I mean it says a ninety two that they said it was ninety eight point two from another study, but then everything I still read says point six. So all right, well, I know what you're talking about, though I had heard in the last few years that they're like that point six jazz is kind of kind of made upright, So, um, the point is is that your body is going to be roughly somewhere around there, right, that's your normal body temperature, and then depending on the time of day, it's either going to be a little cooler in that or a little warmer than that. And our body temperatures are regulated by something called the hypothalamus. And like I said, depending on the time of day, your body temperature is gonna fluctuate, and that's tied to sleep apparently, so as your body temperature is rising, usually in the late afternoon, is about where it peaks during the day. That's associated with wakefulness alertness not necessarily just having a high body temperature, but an incline in the temperature in your body means you're awake, you're alert, you're ready to go right, ready for action. If once it starts to decline, that's associated with drowsiness, and it hits it's um, it's trough. Your body temperature is at its lowest right about before you wake up, and that's actually associated with R E. M. Sleep. So there are some some stuff starting to come out. Just bear with us, everybody. We're laying the groundwork. So your body temperature changes, the hypothalamus is directing the whole thing, and sleep and wakefulness has something to do. It's related to your body temperature changes. All right, good night, you take it from here. Well, you know what, let's take a break because I'm not sure where I should go. We'll be right back. Okay, I was being coy, you said stage very nicely. Okay. Uh So, if your body gets let's say, some bad bacteria gets in it, and your body is alerted warning intruder is coming, your immune system kicks into gear and it starts producing this biochemical material called a pyrogeny. This is my new favorite thing the body does. Yeah, well you knew that before, right or did you just not know the mechanism. I mean, I knew humans get fevers, and I knew the fever was to kind of like cook out everything. I didn't understand the mechanism. I understand answer your question, then, oh yeah, can I So these pyrogen's, right, they are um these biochemical markers that are released by the immune system in the body or and this is why I love this. There's some bacterias, some pathogens that make humans sick that produce pyrogen's naturally. So when they show up, they just start releasing them, and they just give themselves away. It's they're big dummies in that way. They're like, hey, where's the party. They kick open the door. They're carrying like a pony keg under one arm, their guts sticking out. It's just that that's that's like that kind of bacteria, right. So the pyrogans enter the bloodstream and they travel to the hypothalamus because remember the hypothal mis controls your um your body temperature, and this is what they do, Chuck, are you ready for what the pyrogens do. They go to your hypothalamus and they dampen the heat sensing neurons and the hypothalamus, and they excite the cold sensing neurons and your hypothalamus, and they trick your hypothalamus in the thinking your body is suddenly gotten very very cold, so that your hypothalamus turns the temperature up and says, don't let any of this heat out. We gotta we gotta warm back up. It tricks your body and your hypothalamus and creating a fever. That's right. And they do this because well they don't do this because but what happens from there. They do this because they're dumb. But what happens from there is, like you said, the fever, what a fever is, and why you want that fever for at least a little while that it does. It's it's trying to cook and burn and bake that bacteria until it dies. It is your body's fighting. Like when you hear, you know, like your fever broke, that's usually a good sign. That means yeah, right, that your fever did its job and it's cooked all that bacteria up and you're going to be on the men soon. Uh So basically that's what's happening. And this is the great thing about a fever. But um, you know, fever makes you feel like crap because it's a lot of hard work to kill all those things. Well it is, there's a lot of um. Your sympathetic nervous system is kicked into high gear, which I found out is one reason why they say you want to feed a cold starve a fever because you don't want to introduce digestion because it requires the parasympathetic nervous system, right fight or flight, and you don't want those two things going on while your body has a fever. It's just a lot of extra work for it, right, But one of the one of the things that is going on when your body has a fever, when that temperature rises, it's hard enough on your organs, but it's also hard on the level just the fact that they're operating outside of their normal operating temperature, and that makes it very hard on them and can actually cook some of the ingredients inside yourselves. Yeah, I mean, it's like working in a too hot of an environment. It's just it's never fun for anyone. Although we've got some people love that stuff, yeah, but they're still they might like it, but they still aren't working fast. They might be happy, but they're slow. So if you have a fever, what's considered a fever now, if you're an adult and your oral temperature is above one point four or if your rectal or ear temperatures above one oh one then that's considered a fever. If you're a kid, um, good luck getting anything besides the rectal temperature, because it's just tough. You have basically no right well ye which you have as wiggly kids who aren't like, sure, stick something in my ear for four seconds, but up the up the kazoo. There's not really anything you can do about that. All they can do is say, yeah, exactly. So the rectal temperature for a kid above one point four and um. With adults like you don't have to really worry about your fever too much. If it if it tops a hundred and five for you know, any period of time, you probably want to do something about that. That's what I saw was the hundred and five degree hype mark was about where you should start to worry. Yeah, as an adult, and you're gonna feel so awful. If your temperature is one oh five, you're you've probably already been to a doctor at that points. For kids, it's different though. If you don't want to let your child get up to one oh five, that's bad, bad, bad. So what is it for kids that you really want to start worrying? But did you say, you know what I'm not exactly sure. I mean, it probably depends on whether you're a first time pairent or this is your second kid. Well, and it varies with the age, you know, it's like zero to eighteen months. It's something, and like what you should do is consult that your doctor. Yeah exactly. But you know, any kind of temperature you should for a child, you should kind of be a little more alert about, right. But we're not in medical experts here, no, we're not. And everything we're saying assumes that you have healthcare coverage. That's right. Um, all right, so that's fever in general. You got anything else on that? Yeah? One other thing? Um? Uh the pyrogens um Piro. By the way, it's a mistake, man, I did have some coincidence. No, it's not. What is the Latin for fire, Greek word for fire? Yeah, Piro def Leppard, right, Um, a great song. It really is the whole album. Yeah. They just mentioned it in Rock of Ages that comes up. They should have a song called Pyromania wonderful. But that's pretty cool. It's like the antithesis of your band, your album, and your song all being the same name, like Big Country. Oh I love that song. Sure, But it's pretty uncreative, but you're basically saying, like, here's our basket and we're gonna play every egg we have into it. That's the one one thing we came up with. I saw David Spade bit once and he was talking about he was complaining it wasn't even comedy. He's just complaining that he went and saw a big country and they didn't play the song Big Count. Yeah. He's like, it's the name of your band. It's the one song everybody came to see and play it. He's well, the longest, the long and short of it is I totally forgot what the other thing I had to say about Pyritans was, so I'll probably think of it. Oh, I know what it was, Pyrogen's um. As your immune system grows in ages and you become a grown up, the pyrigans have a little less of an effect on you. So where if you're a kid and your immune system is young and inexperienced, your fever is gonna shoot up quick and it's going to it's gonna get hotter faster. So you do want to stay on top of a kid's fever because their immune system is not used to pyrogens coming and messing with their hypothalamus like an adults. It is. Yeah, it'll spike much faster at this good point. That's what I was trying to think of. Yeah, that's true. You need to take that need take that rectal temperature way more than you're comfortable with. I don't recall that ever having been done to me. Well, because you don't remember being a baby. No, but my parents were pretty strict, pretty stern. Mean, by the time a kid is old enough to where you can say, like, hey, put this under your tongue, or hold still for a minute while I put this in your ear, but pre that when they're not sentient humans and they're just you know, crying, whiny little sacks of flesh, you gotta stick it right up the butt. Okay, Harry's laughing. She almost spit out her schwarm a salad. Harry's done plenty of that, so she knows. Okay, So into dreams, um, I always think we've done a general show on dreams. I think we did. Finally, I didn't find it. What still, No, it's a lucid dreaming. Can you control your dreams? That's the same thing, wasn't it. I think that maybe because no, we we did one on dreams. I didn't see it. Wow, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Well, this contributes to the little by little, someone will know. Jill Hurley, where are you when we need you? Our statistician, a minister of stats? All right, well we'll talk about dreams a bit here then, Even though we've explained this in various episodes here and there to some degree, but uh dreams. You know, if you're psychologist, you you really love to spend time talking and dissecting dreams, interpreting dreams. If you're a um more into the neurology side of science, you don't really care about that kind of stuff. Um. In fact, for many years they thought it was called activation synthesis hypothesis, which was you go to sleep and all these uh synapsters are just randomly firing and they don't really add up to even a story. You just do that when you wake up because you're human. Yeah, but that I mean, that's complete. Bs. Well, you almost get the impression that they came up with this, and the neurologists came up with it to stick out their territory in response to years of psychoanalysts saying, this is what dreams are like, tapping into the collective unconscious or um, they're you're repressed memories. Neuroscience said, no, nothing, they're just your stupid, wet brain going crazy while you sleep. Yeah, which we all know now is not true. I saw another one too. What's that um threat simulation theory? Have you heard of that one? No, but that's a great band name. Basically, it's you're training to be a ninja while you sleep, Like your brain is running threat simulations constantly, so that it's like working itself out, like getting more and more agile and quick and like, like, so you can get better at running from a savor tooth tiger if you actually encounter it. I can see that early on maybe, and there is an evolutionary advantage to it, so evolutionarily speaking, it would make sense. The point is it that one came along? I was like, no, there's obviously some reason for dreams. It's not just random yet. Well, and then maybe I could have seen that early on. But then at some point someone around the fire had a dream about Tuktok's wife and woke up and went, whoa, there was no savor tooth tiger and that I'm not sure what that meant, uh, but I better not tell tuktok, right, you know. And then they went, what's a rectal themome hasn't even been invented yet, so uh. These days they've done actual studies, um, with E e. G. Machines and MRI machines, and especially in Italy, these Italian researchers basically put people to sleep, not put them to sleep and the sleeper hole. They lay them down in a nice Italian bed, feed them some postaphazul, and get out the rectal thermometer and they hook him up to all these wires and machines. And then they will wake them up at different points in the night and say, hey, what were you dreaming of? Um, we'd like to talk about it and study what was going on with these machines. And um. They actually what they found supports the current the prevailing theory. I don't think it was their theory. I think it was around, but their research supports it called affect regulation theory, which is basically that we control our emotions or we process our emotions through our dreams. And these Italians found support for this and that when they woke people up and asked them what they were dreaming about. The ones who had the best recall were the ones who had the most Theta waves in their frontal lobes, which are slow moving waves. Right. Yes, And when you look at an e G machine, if you looked at those dreamers brain waves, it looked like the brain waves of somebody who was sitting there forming and recalling memories. So these people said, that's what they're doing. That's what all of us are doing. While we're dreaming. We're forming memories. We're taking emotions that we've experienced through the day and we're creating memories out of them so we can file them away. So we're processing our emotions and our dreams. That's the point of dreams. That's the current understanding. Yeah, and then I mean other parts of the brain that have been active all sort of deal with emotion, whether it's the a magdala and the hippocampus or the lingual gyrus, which I think we just talked about that in another episode. I don't recall. I can't remember, um, but they're all areas of the brain that relate to emotion and memory, and some with visual activity. And you know that kind of makes sense. I like that theory and then under that current theory, so that's like the the explanation for regular dreams. And you can't just have a theory for dreams without including nightmares or else your theory is broken. Right, So the affect regulation theory considers nightmares. Um, basically, it's an emotion that's being put into the process of being, of creating a memory, a false memory, right, a dream memory, I guess you put it. But it's a real emotion, right, and um, it's so big it breaks the process. And all of a sudden, this process of creating a fake memory of fake experience, UM, goes haywire. And now all of a sudden you're enduring some terrible, horrifying experience because the emotion that was being processed was too big and got out of control. And now you have a nightmare t s for you. Yeah, I think we did one of night terrors. We did for sure, and sleep paralysis. We've covered it all. I think I guess we were. They haven't done a dreams one, all right, So let's take another break. We're gonna come back and finally talk about fever dreams. You robbed me of a Saturday night fever reference. I just want to go on record this thing that I was wrong, So Chuck, here's where everything just kind of goes totally off the rail. We've talked about fevers, We've talked about nightmares. The problem is really understanding both doesn't necessarily amount to understanding them together. Right, So, knowing what fevers are, knowing what dreams are, it doesn't mean you know what fever dreams are. But you can make stuff up if you want. Yeah, and I don't. I'm boy, I don't even think we even said if you've never had a fever dream, you might even know we're talking about. Feel kind of dumb at this point in the podcast. But a fever dream is um, basically a nightmare on steroids. It's just so vivid and so real and scary. Um that happens, you know, when you are sick with a fever. Yes, obviously, so their fever dreams, right, so they are a thing. Yeah, but the scientific literature on them is super thin, non existent. Kids seemed to get them, if not more, at least they stand out more to children, and so anecdotally people seem to recall having fever dreams. More when they were kids. Whether or not that's true or just a memory is uh or you know what do you call it, like a memory bias or whatever, There's no one really knows. Yeah, well that yeah, I mean, we don't really know because I don't remember the last time I had a fever and if I did, whether or not I had had a fever dream. I I don't think I've ever had a fever dream. I did when I was a kid. I don't remember having fever dreams. I remember being sick as a kid and having like nightmares when I was sick, so like they're noticeably worse than your average nightmare. Really, so would you keep waking up from them? Mm hmmm, that I don't remember. See, that's that's a big question to me. Um. Well, let's talk about the anecdotal theory of what is behind fever dreams. Right, So, when your body is undergoing a fever, we said that your body is not functioning at its top performance. Um, and that includes the brain. The brain itself is an extremely special organ if you didn't know already, it's like, I think two of the body's mass, but it requires twenty of the body's energy. Yeah, and the neurons compared to regular old dumb cells. Uh uh, they they burn or they need about between three times more energy than a regular dumb cell in your body. Right. And so when all these chemical processes, when all of this UM energy is being exploited to power cells, UM, it produces the byproduct of heat. So the brain is super sensitive to overheating right already, just under normal circumstances, and it's generally taken care of, uh by by your body, like it's you know that it's cooled down and regulated. Right. So, Um, if you have a fever and your brain is not operating at optimal conditions, but you're asleep, so it's trying to go through its normal processes. Um, if you have a nightmare, it's entirely possible that that nightmare is going to be far far worse because the normal processes have broken down, or it's even further possible apparently. Um. The amygdalas frequently implicated with nightmares because it has to do with being terrified or angry or fearful. Um, the amigdala might be functioning at an abnormal level and it's just basically going haywired while you have a fever. Yeah, and then the fact that most dreams occur during R E M sleep, and I think that's when you're body is warmest sleep anyway, right, that's when see, this is where it all gets kind of hinky. During R E M sleep, your hypothalamus says I'm done, I'm not working right now, so it stops regulating temperature, which is usually why your body temperature is lowest right before you wake up. I thought it was highest right before you wake up. No, it's highest in the afternoon while you're awake. It's lowest right before you wake up. I feel like I always wake up hot. You. I mean, you may be like sleeping with too many blankets, your room might be a little too warm, or maybe it's my stupid you know, schedule of my see, I mean it could be you know, it might have cut off a couple hours before or something. Right, it could be right, so fires up after I get up. Because supposedly, um, when you are sleeping and you're in R E M sleep, your hypothalamus is not regulating temperature during that period. So if you if you are already hot, and remember high body temperature is associated with wakefulness, then maybe you are waking up more frequently than you normally would, and when you wake up in the middle of a dream, you're more prone to remember it. If you wake up in the middle of a nightmare, it's going to seem even worse than one that you had and woke up normally from. Yeah, I mean I had a series of not nightmares last night, but just sort of anxiety dreams. And I don't have any anxiety about anything right now. I think it was just after reading all this stuff. Yeah, I'm just suggestible you had anxiety dreams. Yeah, but not about like nothing specific. No, like there's you know usually if I have anxiety dreams and just like because something's going on in my life, I'm anxious. But it was just a research huh, I think so. I men, you're dedicated. But they were also celebrity dreams because you know I've talked about those before. No, Yeah, yeah, that I have just celebrity dreams all the time. But they're just very normal that I'm just like friends with celebrity people. But were they were the anxiety written last night? Yes, Like I was hanging out with a band Luna Dean were um of Luna and that was but there was. I can't remember exactly what was going on, but you know that was anxiety involved, like I was trying to get somewhere and couldn't get there, like the typical stupid dream stuff, you know. But some Dean was in there somehow. Yeah. Have you talked to him today? I don't know him, but uh, I think I know why they were in there, That's all I'll say. Okay, wink wink, I guess. So. Here's another thing that was in our own article I thought was interesting and just a little tidbit, was that, um, some recreational drug like meth and ecstasy can raise brain temperatures. That is one of the reasons they think that it kills so many brain cells when you do those drugs. Yes, supposedly you're not supposed to take ecstasy and warm climates. Yeah, never have heard that. Yeah, just norway. Well there you have it, only it's fall barred. Um what else is there anything else in here? No? Man, I can't believe we stretched this one out as far as we did. Alright, we never have to talk about fever dreams again, Chuck good. If you want to know more about fever dreams, well you might as well start at how stuff works dot com. There's nothing wrong with that, um. And you can also just go around and look at how sparse the researches on the internet for yourself. And if you are a researcher and you know more stuff about fever dreams that you can point us to let us know. UM. In the meantime, I think I said search bars somewhere in there, which means it's time for a listener mail. Uh, you know what. I think another reason the anxiety dreams is because I'm barreling through this season of Fargo. And yeah, and the two episodes I watched last night, which I believe we're if there are ten, I think it was eight and nine, we're both just like ratcheted up with sin. I'm sure that's what it was. And I think that probably has something to do with it. That happens to me sometimes I'll be watching something I won't realize how on top of me it's gotten, and then all of a sudden, like it goes to an ad and I'm like really uptight about like this scratching washing machine sale that's going on somewhere, and I don't understand why. I'm like, oh wow, that TV show really got to me. Yeah, I think I think Fargo had something to do it. Think you may have nailed it. Um, all right, I'm gonna call this one garden variety fan mail, which we don't read a lot of these, so I'm going to dig in. Hey, guys, that's all this is fan mail.
