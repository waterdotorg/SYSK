Josh: Welcome to you stuff you should know from house Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Joshua Clark. There's Charles W. Chuck Bryant, and Jerry's over there. I'm speaking in a monotone kind of Hey, dude, Hey, how's it going. It's going well. I'm not motionsick, so things are fine. Do you get motion sick sometimes? I mean, if the conditions are right. I was really surprised to find that not everybody gets motion sick. What are your conditions? Um, poor ventilation and like lots of movement, um, backseat of a car. Okay, uh, but anytime I read in a car, even like glancing at my phone on a map. Really, if I have to read anything, it gets me very quick. So I've just learned that, like, I can't do it. Yeah, I cannot do it. So I don't I get it a little bit too. I used to get it more, I think when I was younger. Supposedly it's normal. Supposedly it is. But I remember a very specific story that my brother still laughs at. And by the way, boy, I'm glad I said that I owe my brother, my big brother, a big apology because I saw him over the weekend and he said, oh, by the way, I was just done an old episode and he said, you've never been a groom's a best man. I was the best man at my brother's wedding. Man. I felt like a jerk, man, Scott, I'm sorry, I know. And what happened was when I said I hadn't, I just like quickly scanned through my friends that have gotten married, and I didn't think about my brother and I was his best man. A jerk. Well, it's it's rectified now. Well I told him. I was like, you're gonna get a public apology. So there it is. That's pretty public. Yeah, it gets. You could have also started a scores based website if you wanted, but it's really easy that. Um So, anyway, this is old story. When we went to Disney, uh geez, which is the one where Body Wars is at. You should have asked Holly from stuff you missed in history, she would know if she probably senses that someone's talking about Disney right now. Body Wars either was or still is. I don't know if it's still there. One of those rides that you sit in a you know, it's one of those first sort of virtual things where they show you a movie and then they moved the car, like The Amazing Voyage or something, wasn't it. Yeah, you went inside a human body and we're traveling around. I want to say disney World, but I can't remember. Um so I went in that, And I mean, wait, I'm getting you grew up in Atlanta. I'm guessing you went to disney World. Well, it definitely was at Disneyland, but I don't know if he was Epcot, Universal Studio Guys, or Disney World. It was in Orlando. So from what I under stand, we have a buddy who works for Disney and he set me straight on this before, and I think I've got it. So disney World is all of those. The Magic Kingdom is what you're specifying. So disney World includes Epcott and Universal Studios. If I'm not mistaken, I really hope I'm not missing. The Magic Kingdom is specifically with the Castle. Right. If I did get that wrong, Brandon, I apologize. It's one with the castle. All the weird adults that think their children like, uh so, body wars. Anyway, you're traveling through the body, and I remember at one point I was like, man, it's getting hot in here, and Scott's like, this is great. I was like, I'm not feeling so good man. It's like, do they have the heat going. It's like, what are you talking about? It feels great? And I got I didn't vomit, but I got really sick and made it through the ride and left. And he still teases me to this day. He was like, it was temperature air controlled, and you thought it was like ninety degrees and they were like pumping in heat. It's funny, like it got to you like that, like your own body cold sweats the who while, yeah, that's bad, but generally you you actually did puke, No, no, no, I did not, you didn't. But generally I don't like it takes a certain thing, like a really hardcore roller coaster going in fast, fast circles, but I don't get sick complaints or the one cruise I went on, it didn't get sick. Yeah, you know, I've gotten. I've gotten sick before, like on vacation. But and I'm planes, it's usually fairly fleeting. It's when I introduced reading that it's like you're in big trouble for a long time. You can read on a plane though I can't. Yeah, yeah, yeah, now I think about it's reading in a car. I just gotta stay away from that. But usually it does come about with like poor ventilation that kind of thing, um yeah, which is another trigger, it's a big one, or like a rough odor or something like that. I'm sure all those things don't help. The thing is for for as much as like we kind of commonly understand and motion sickness, science really doesn't have a full explanation for it. I'm picturing little Josh because riding backwards is bad and like a rumble seat in a station wagon, in a in a super u brat with like your dad has like salami socks on or something that stink what like the windows are rolled up. I don't know, it just anything. It's something gross salamie socks, like socks made of salami, Like, wouldn't that smelled gross? He's wearing the skin of another person. Well, now I was thinking smelled like old salami, but made of salamis even better, right. I think I'm just picturing you back there, like reading your Mad magazine feeling bad. Yeah, yeah, no, I do remember being a kid and figuring out I can't read in cars. There was a period where I could, which is kind of surprising because when you're younger, you're more susceptible to motion sickness. But I could read in the car while I was younger, and then probably around the time of puberty, I was like, I can't do this anymore. You went opposite weird. Yeah, well maybe you developed your hips, right, because that's a tease. We'll just leave that out there, all right. So people supposedly are susceptible to motion sickness. Uh, and it can happen on planes, it can happen. It's weird. This one University of Maryland side I went to said, uh, the following are the most common risk factors riding in a car, boat, airplane, or space shuttle. Really, yeah, nerds, Just like they didn't even put the amusement park ride. They just went straight to space shuttle. You know, one that I hadn't seen before. But apparently as the thing is, I'm looking through a microscope, Yeah I hadn't. That makes a little bit of sense though, Yeah, because the slide can move in. Your eyes are seeing movement, but you're not moving, and yeah, I'll get to you. Uh. Like another nerdy motion sickness space shuttles and microscope. Uh So, like you said, age between two and twelve, you're more likely uh, and then you're also more likely to grow out of it after puberty. And one of the reasons that women are more motion sickness than men or get motion sickness more than men is because one of the theories is that after puberty they developed more in the hips. Men develop more in the chest, and I guess that makes a difference. They didn't really explain why they did that. Well, it all has to do with sway theory, which Will's right, sway theory. Yeah, but it is true that, like, women are more susceptible just on average, to motion sickness than men are. Yeah, studies apparently also Asian women, well Asian period because Pinn State did a study and they put people in situations that make emotion sick or not. Did you look into those Oh is it like a tilted world, dude? Like if you went in for just a clinical study, like I'm gonna make some scratch or maybe they'll give me a cool drug or something, and it turns out to be a motion sickness study, you should leave. No, I totally was. So there's this thing called a um opt to kinetic drum, I believe is what it's called. Oh I did see that. Yeah, I have to connectic. It's it's like um a drum, like a big drum that you sit inside of, and it's got a vertical black and white painted stretched and it spins around you and the motion, the movement is really emphasized and like it's designed to make anybody motion sick and that's how they induce motion sickness. And I saw another one UM where they use a chair that just kind of moves you around, whether you like it or not, and it induces motion sickness. Like, what a terrible thing to have happened to you. Man. There was a ride at six Flags over Georgia growing up that they got rid of because someone got hurt, supposedly where it's this barrel that you all get in. You stand it, it's like kind of below ground. You stand against the wall. Love those and it's spins so fast. Then they dropped the floor beneath you and then some trifical force holds you against the wall. It's like the spin cycle in the washing machine. You mean, I were just talking about that. The other thing was awful. That was my favorite of all time. Really, I just thought it was so cool. Well, the old story was that someone's leg got trapped when the floor came back up. But I remember here now that I look back, because I'm sure that was an old live stale. Although I was on Snoops the other day and I was reading an early article and they were talking about, um, you know, the urban legend about some girl who got scalped because her hair got caught in an amusement park ride or something. It actually happened, really, Yeah, the girl's ponytail got caught in there. It just got pulled right off of her head. I know, but it actually did happen. So it's possible someone's leg got got sucked into the tiltal world. Well, but then what happens is it happened at every amusement park, right, It happened to my cousin's friend, right, Alright. So the Penn State study, uh, they put people in these torture machines, and interestingly, they did confirm eight of Asian people got sick when it was less than fifty percent for Caucasian and non Caucasian, which is really it's very crazy. Um, but it kind of underscores a growing awareness among motion sickness researchers a K that the evil ones um that genetics play a big role in susceptibility to motion sickness. Well, yeah, because there were another couple of findings that lend to that. UM. Twins. They study two hundred sets of identical twins, and one percent of the identical twins were both affected. Um. Yeah, and some of that, you know, they can't prove that it's genetics because it also could be the uh just where they were raised and how were they were raised. What's it called uh nurture environment environment environmental um. And if parents are both susceptible to motion sickness, they found that their children are five times more likely. So it's sort of points to genetics. But then other things point away from genetics, like why why would you know two people in the same family in the same conditions not get sick? Or why did why why did two people period not get sick under the same conditions. Yeah, Like, I guess what I'm saying, salami socks smell same backwards facing seat. Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is they haven't figured it out, No, they haven't. But if we do figure out that it's genetic, thanks to the magic of the Crisper Casts nine gene editing process to be able to knock that right out for you, what else is pregnant? Yeah, pregnant women are more susceptible to it. Um, women who are menstruating, I think also are, and people who get migraines are more susceptible. And then people who sleep poorly are more susceptible to um uh. Motion sickness. Yeah, it says if you're prone to nausea or vomiting, but I don't know if that's like, that's sort of a chicken or the egg thing. Well, we're gonna get into again. We said science as to understand exactly what's going on here. But there's some good theories. We're gonna talk about them right after, so chuck, Yeah, let's talk about some theories for motion sickness because it's kind of two Yeah. I saw I think it was this Atlantic article you sent. It's not so much um, it's not so much science. It's a debate over you know, the likelier explanation, but they actually kind of fit together. I think so, but if you ask the people, apparently the author in the Atlantic, Uh, it's called the Mysterious Science Emotion Sickness. He's sort of pokes fun a little bit. He's like, to me, they sound sort of the same. But don't tell that to those people who believe one or the other, because they're like, no, they're nothing like each other. She Julie beck I was that, who wasn't nice? Job, Julie good article. Um, pat on the back for you, cold star. So, uh, here's the first one is and this one. They both make a lot of sense to me. Um. Basically, there's a dissonance between the parts of your body that sense motion. Right, that's the easiest way to say it. It's called the sensory conflict theory. To get dryballs. Yeah, that it senses motion. It's it's weird if you think about your eyes doing that, but that's one of the roles that they play in motion. You also have the vestibular system, which is centered around your inner ear, and that definitely senses motion, movement, acceleration, gravity. Uh. And then you have all the sensors, the sensors and like your muscles and joints and stuff, right, Yeah, I didn't really think about that is being one, but for sure, like your body actually feels it. Yeah, well, think about it, like if you if you feel yourself kind of moving backward, you're definitely sensing it through your inner ear, but you can also feel it in your feet as well, and they're sending a a bulletin to your brain saying, lean forward, dummy, you're gonna fall back. What's your problem? Friend? So, this dissonance occurs when basically, like let's say you're sitting in a movie theater like an IMAX and it's a scene where you're you're flying with Superman or something like. You're seeing this with your eyeballs like a first person perspective shot of flight, but you're sitting in your seat, so your eyes are saying you're flying and your butts going you're sitting here and your brains like a witch. Yeah, pretty much witchcraft. Uh. So it creates this, This creates motion sickness. That's when the uh, nausea might kick in, dizziness, uh, those cold sweats, salivation. I like how the the author of the house Stuff Works article pointed out she specifically mentioned Avatar. Yeah, who is the dude? Um? The the guy who was like the friend on the Flight of the Concords Mary. No, the other dude, the guy who worked in the pond. Yeah, yeah, oh man, what is his name? It's not Range Parker, Arrange Parker, Yes, it was. I always want to call him Boslerman. I know it's definitely not the same dude Parker. You mean. I went to go see him. He did some stand up, right, and he was talking about Avatar, and he said, when it first came up, people like, oh, Avatar, have you seen Avatar? Yea great And then like everything you heard was have you seen Avatar? You gotta see Avatar, you said, like after a couple of weeks, you'd just be walking down the sidewalk and people would pull up alongside you in your car and roll down the window and go Avatar. And this is I think a great example of that. Well, it's interesting. I posted an article on Facebook not too long ago on the Stuff you Should Know page about this person wrote an article about Avatar and the argument was that it for such a huge movie, it had like zero cultural impact, Like it was big at the time, but does anyone care now, Like it's not like the Star Wars World or Star Treker, all these things, and I totally agreed. I saw Avatar once and I was like, I'm done with it. Typical James Cameron schlock. I've seen it zero times. No, that sucks, But dude, there are Avatar people though, that piled on and we're like, what's god no idea what he's talking about? It's totally relevant. Oh, I'm sure they're gonna be all over Facebook page after this episode comes out. Hey, Chuck forever. Now, I like some of James Cameron stuff, but if he wrote the script, then it's I'm not gonna like it. No, I know what you mean. I think he's a hack writer. Yeah. Did I just say that two hundreds of thousands of people? Yeah, And I'm sure James Cameron cares what you think. He's at the bottom of the Marianna Trench right now. He's not. He's picking out my future burial site. So um, Chuck, we're talking about the century conflict theory, right, that's one big explanation, and it definitely kind of makes sense. Right. Your your brain just basically gets overloaded and it's like, oh, I need to sit down. I've got the vapors, right, I'm doing a lot of bad impressions in this episode was supposed to be uh, somebody fainting in the late nineteenth century. Oh, no, it's great. So it was your arch Parker fop. That's what it was. It was a fop the dandy popping. There's another competing idea, and that is, UM, we kind of talked about. UM. It's called sway theory. Yeah. And there's a dude, h Thomas uh staff or staff Regin. I'm going with the gin s University of University of Minnesota, Professor of Kinesiology and listen to this. He's the director of it Affordance Perception Action Laboratory NERD. He gets motion sickness looking through microscope. UM. So he proposes the sway theory UM, which basically has nothing to do with the vestibular system. He said. He says that I don't I don't necessarily agree with that, but okay, I agree that he thinks that. No, I know that he thinks that I don't agree with that his take on that. Agree. I think it's still tied together. But his theory is and this first part isn't theory. It's true is that everyone sways like unless you're one of those uh people that stand like motionless in the middle of New Orleans for money. M hmm, yeah, silver or something like that. Yeah, they're good, they're good at it. But if you're just a regular dope like you and I, when we stand there, we're gonna be moving in a little bit. Yeah, you mean swaying a little bit. It's weird, like if you stop and like really pay attention to it. Yeah, you you notice it, but you'll never notice it unless you are focused on that. Yeah, you're always moving a little bit. Yeah, swaying. If you're standing up, you're swaying for the most part. Yes. And the point he makes is if everyone truly relaxed every muscle in their body, they'd fall over. Right. So the whole point, the whole thing is swaying is it's the byproduct of us standing upright, which is not something we've been doing for all of the time we've been on earth, because we evolved from things that walked on four legs. Standing up is kind of new. Well, sure, and babies don't stand up, they have to, yeah, exactly. So um Stoffordgin's whole idea is that motion sickness comes about when you have um when you're exposed to movement that contradicts the natural um swaying that you've learned to do to stand upright right, and it undermines it, and your brain goes Which makes sense in a way because let's say you're on a boat and the boat's tilting to the left, and so what you're feet do, or you know, they account for that, and maybe you lean in on the inside of your foot and your toes flex so because you want to make yourself more upright again. And then the boat turns again in a direction you're not expecting. You're correcting for that first move, the second move happens, and your body doesn't know what to do. So here's the thing. The the sensory conflict one makes a little more sense to me than this one, because that sounds to me like if that if that were the case, if that's what's going on, and it clearly is. Like when it's when you get your sea legs or whatever um you you you were moving along, you're trying to stay standing under these weird conditions, why would that translate into something like dizziness or nausea or vomiting or cold sweats that doesn't make sense to me. Sensory conflict I can see translating into it. But even beyond that, a lot of people are like, no, that doesn't Still, it doesn't make sense why you would vomit. And this one guy named um Michael Easman seven came up with a pretty awesome explanation for why we should get nauseated when we get motion sick right. Well, yeah, should we take a break and talk about that? Oh all right, Josh Michael Treatman seven in the journal Science. What did he say? Oh? He said that we get nauseated from motion sickness because over there are some toxins out there that can mess with our vestibular system. Right, yes, So the body is tricked into thinking that it's possibly been exposed to some sort of toxin because the vestibular vestibular system is out of whack from motion sickness, So it gets nauseated and ultimately might vomit as a reflex to get rid of whatever toxin it thinks has been ingested. It's basically a case of mistaken identity. I think it explained it perfectly. It makes sense to me. I could see a little bit. I think what Um what staff Regin is saying is that you're you're used to regaining your balance. You spend your entire life learning this system, and that if it's thrown off, what he doesn't do is connect it. I believe, I believe you're right. He doesn't connect it in the end to like something that happens in your brain, right, the the why the physiological reaction agreed. Yeah, but he does have some pretty good evidence backing his idea of sway theory up though. Um, so again, women are more susceptible to um to motion sickness than men. Right, Yes, that's what they say. Well, he says, ah, Well, Sway theory explains that um, kids are equally susceptible to both genders are equally susceptible to motion sickness before puberty. Then after puberty, the bodies change and where um, women and men hold most of their weight is different. Right, Women hold it mostly around their hips. Men hold it more around their chest, and that means that the center of gravity is different, which means the amount that we sway is different. Right yeah, I think Uh? Who does he say sways? Women's way farther but slower, but slower Men's sway faster but within a tighter area. And and these are micro sways. Yeah, I mean I think that like most people move no more than like an inch to any given side. And even then you're like Barney on the Simpsons when he walked out for that like bachelor um auction. Uh. Then there's also landsickness, which is interesting. Yeah. I didn't look too much into it, but I have heard of it, which is basically the concept that if you're a sailor, then you've gotten or you know, just somebody who's been on boats enough. You don't have to be a professional. Um, you get your sea legs so well that you get landsickness. Yeah. When you get back, Yeah, and you're on solid ground, you're like, I don't know what to do, right because your your brain so used to things moving that it perceives that it's moving even though it's not. You want to say the French name for it, mild barkmant let me look, I wasn't even looking. That was you forgot the middle part. There's a qui in the middle, so maybe mal de bark uman, I said, Mel debarkmon Mel debarkmall barkman barbecue mal I love that when we do this stuff, there's it's probably literally fi people laughing and people want to kill us. Yeah, you know, yeah, a lot of people want to kill us. Can about as long as they never do alright, So, um, should we go over some some things that you can do? Because I mean that that whole segment on what explains most of the sickness kind of petered out. But that's the state of science right now. Yeah, although they will say they have looked at the twenty three in me um for the genetic side and have found some support for both claims. I think that they're together. Like I think, if yes, your your swaying system is set up in a certain way, and why can't that be a component that, along with the vestibular system and your site and all that um is affected and creates motion sickness. I just don't understand why it has to be one or the other. That's the impression that I had he was trying to really come get across, is that it's no, it's its own thing. I think that's weird. So what do you what do you go to if you get motion sick Well, they say to keep your eyes on the horizon, whether you're in a car or a boat or whatever, that that will help cuts down on motion, right or the sensation of motion. I'm not sure. I think so because think about it. When you look at stuff that's close to the car, it's blurring the horizon, sting. Yeah, constant look at you. Um, keep your head still so you can lay down if you're able to somewhere, um or at least put your head back against the seat. Just sort of keep it as still as possible. Don't smoke. Sure, they say it's just good advice all around exactly. Um, if you're gonna fly, they say to avoid big, greasy meals and alcohol the night before and eat light meals or snacks low in calories the day of. But yeah, you do want to have something in your stomach, though, because that's just gonna help empty stomach. No good turn that air vent. Whether you're in your car or a plane or a boat, you need want some fresh air blowing on your face, ideally or at least cycled air felt this bed sinstead. It need to brank hunt uh, sit in the front of the airplane or over a wing. Supposedly, yeah, the rear of the airplane. Oh man, you just get whipped around back, and it's way worse if you get motion sick You should never sit behind the the wings of the airplane. See I love the last car of a roller coaster though, Well, yeah, you're feeling it more, you're enjoying it more. You don't get motion sick. Um what else? Avoid salty foods before you travel. There's also remedies too, right, So the jury is out on whether ginger actually helps or not, or if it's just the placebo effect. Ginger, peppermint, and black horehound apparently are some of the herbs that may or may not work. Who knows. UM, I can tell you firsthand, and I looked it up. See bands actu pressure bracelets that go on your wrist three fingers with down from the heel of your palm, the pairicardium six so the acupuncture point. I saw research that showed that UM, neither placebo nor acupressure bands had any effect on motion sickness. I can tell you that even if it is just placebo, they still work firsthand. They work alright, even if it's placebo. I don't care. That's fine as long as it keeps me from being motionsick. Yeah. Yeah, it kept me and you me from being motion sick on an entire cruise. But would you have been motion sick without it? Yeah, because we had We didn't use it for one day and we felt immediately. Yeah, Um, I brought one on my only cruise that I went to and uh, I don't think I work because I didn't need to. We had like divots on our risk because we just come on like the whole the time. Yeah, you should bring it just in case. Yeah. Sure. We also had scope al amin and we didn't even use it because the c bands work so well. Drama meine, is that the same thing or different? Scope ala mean? Is that stuff that like eight um drug people with and then uh, it's like remember in our truths Herem episode we talked about scope limit. It's like a drug in South America where they'll they'll dose you with it and then you end up like just basically becoming zombified and don't remember anything. It's the same stuff, but it doles the messages from your inner ear to your brain, so your sensation of motion is decreased. Homeopathy, there haven't been a ton of studies about the effective effectiveness of specific remedies. But they do say things like borax, coculus, petroleum, tabacum. Dude, So we're gonna hear from so many people just for having even uttered the word homeopathy. Does that I say it homeopathy? No? It goes both ways. Um, yeah, I know. I mean, nothing drives people more crazy than that. They're gonna go desert mark my word because it's not you know, well, well I said that that take it or leave it. Basically, some people swear by it, yeah, and some people think it's uh too. From what I have ever seen, it's like the biggest flashpoint, uh like of anything, of anything at Skeptics talk about nothing drives them crazier than than homeopathy. Ye like makes them nuts. It's kind of funny to watch it does, because then you people say you shouldn't even say western versus Eastern medicine. You should say proven science versus like witchcraft. Who did the people say that? On Facebook? Yeah, they get really like, you shouldn't even say I don't even see it. I said you can't say it, don't even say it? Josh? Um what else? Yeah, I'm making fun of you. Mind body medicine, biofeedback training and relaxation. They did a study of fifty pilots UM who had to stop flying due to motion sickness, which, by the way, I didn't know that, Like that frightens me just knowing that that a pilot can get most but think about it. For the pilot, it's like career ending, you know. Um, seventy of them got over their motion sickness and we're able to return to work after biofeedback training and relaxation programs. So basically they sit in that tilt a whirl, bring it on, and then biofeedback instruments record uh, temperature, muscle tension, and they use relaxation techniques uh and mental imagery in the chair and over time, it's sort of like cognitive behavioral therapy, which is another thing that they use, which is like, you know, get in the chair and do it until it doesn't affect you. An exposure therapy, right yeah. Um. There's this guy named Sam Puma who's a physician and aeronautics engineer. I think maybe at the very least, he's worked in the aerospace industry for a really long time, and he has come up with some habituation exercises where basically you kind of mildly expose your body to the kind of move mints it's going to expect on like a space shuttle or whatever ahead of your trip, and you can he says, you can be prepared and not have any emotion sickness and as little as a week. Yeah, and I guess it checks out, Yeah, because it sounds like, you know, come on, what's this guy selling me? Right? But then the Atlantic author she said, you know, no, apparently it's a real thing. Uh. And then another good tip that I saw was, if you're in a car and you're not driving, pretend like you're driving. You might feel silly, but you know, pretend like you're driving. Maybe even do your hands and anticipate the curbs and things. Maybe give him a little horn, a little imaginary horn once an ord. Uh. Yeah. The reason why the best seat in the car is the drivers because you can anticipate the movements the car is gonna make, which supports sway theory if you think about it, true because you can counteract it. Do you ever have one of those passengers in your car that hits the break because they're nervous. It's like, I just an involuntary action. You seem stumped their foot on the floorboard. It's pretty funny. I have one friend in particular that does that. Uh, let's see. I guess that's it, right. I got nothing else. Um, if you want to learn more about motion sickness, you can type those words in the search part how stuff works dot com. And since I said search bar, it's time for the listener mayo, I'm gonna call this uh Bonsai to two. Hey, guys, love the show. I'm a twotoo maker who new but you know somebody makes them. Sure they don't just grow on trees, not anymore. I'm a two two maker and work alone in my studio a lot making two tooos and you guys are my company and thank you for that. Also have a Bachelor of Science and ornamental horticulture. So listening to the bonsai episode reminded me of an experience ad with a bonsai master in a class I had in college. The professor covered the art of bonsai. Leading up to this man's visit. He covered the art, particulous decisions made in the shaping of the tree, et cetera. The day came when the master was there to speak with us. It came into class, and all of his amazing work was displayed around the classroom. It was really beautiful. Everyone sort of spoke about it in touchstones, very reverent to each other. Finally, the master, who was a rather tiny Japanese man, was ready to demonstrate the technique for us. He unpotted the plant in front of him, spoke about the shape and what he felt would be the best way to train it. And after this, he pulled out a club the size of a baseball bat and beat the crap out of the root ball, explaining the need to control the plant, and no one knew exactly how to recapt I had not thought about that for a really long time, and I listened to the show chuckling the whole time because of it. I thought you might appreciate the story that is from Nancy Gallagher, the two Tuo maker. Well thanks a lot, Nancy. Uh. Maybe he was just trying to get the dirt away from the roots, I don't know, or maybe it was bad Bonsai. Mr Miyagi would never do that. I worked with Pat Marita. Did I mention that on the show? Was it? He did a music video that I worked on, the Karate Kid spoof? Oh oh, yeah, alien Ant Farm and I worked with him. He's super nice and it was just a couple of years. Whore he died. He's dead. Oh yeah, that's the shame. Yeah, he liked the white wine. Oh yeah, I think he told me the story for it. Sounds familiar. I had to go fetch him some chardonay like noon. I was like, you know what if that was Pat Marina on the side of the music video, sure, I'd be like, I'd have a p a fetch me some chardonnay do. Yeah. Remember he played Al the replacement Al l Happy case Arnold al was the name of the actor. Yeah, right from California at Marita. What was that to do with it? Nothing? Oh that was an additional fact. Yeah, I just I mean some people might see the Karate Kid and I only know that and and keys from Japan. But he was putting on that accident. Oh yeah, yeah, he's a California dude, totally. Yeah, like laid back kind of shardonay guy.
