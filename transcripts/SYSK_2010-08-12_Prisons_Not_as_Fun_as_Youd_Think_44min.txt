Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know from how Stuff Works dot com. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark with me as always as Charles W. Chuck Bryant as if you're surprised. Uh, and that makes this stuff you should know, right, Chuck, Yes, we are here, Josh, and uh can we talk about prisons? Now? We can talk about prisons. Remember in the Presidential Pardons episode, I was talking about how people have been calling for President Obama to reduced to basically issue a blanket pardon for people who are convicted under the mandatory minimums for crack where there's a huge disparity, and I said it was like five to one. It's actually it was I think, um, a hundred and eighty to one disparity. Right, boy got that one wrong, did well? He did it like pretty much as we were recording that he signed this law. Congress was passing this law that reduced the mandatory minimum and basically, in a effect, overturned the sentences of first time offenders who are convicted and we're given these five years and anybody who was convicted under the old mandatory minimum laws. So there's gonna be a lot of people coming out of prison looking for crack. Well, that's one argument that's not very fair to say. No, it's not. But I mean, isn't that kind of the the way that Americans and probably people in general view prisoners. It's like, you did something wrong, so you deserve to be where you are. But that's without having any real concept of what prison is like. I mean, I know I don't want to be in prison. Have you ever seen the movie An Innocent Man? Remember we talked about that Tom Selleck, very scary scene. That was it for me. I was like, I don't ever want to go to prison ever. Um. But that's about all I knew about it until we started researching for this very robust podcast on how prison works. So Chuck, um, I guess Apparently when this article was written by Grabanowski, it was I think two thousand five ish or that was the latest stats he had, and it said he said that there were like more than two million people in prison, right, and it's actually decreased. Yeah, I've got one point six million at the end of oh nine. But when I look at these stats there, they're all kinds of stats. Um. You know, one in thirty one adults is in the correction system, but that includes jail, prison, probation, and supervision. So they narrowed that down to only in prison. One and every one hundred Americans is in prison. I know. And that crazy. Did you see what fair state topped the list for the most number of adults in prison? That's right, Georgia, Georgia one in thirteen people, one in thirteen adults, and Georgia's in the correctional system. That's crazy. Yeah, we live in a state of criminals. Either that or some like a real police state, one of the two. Uh yeah, I'm not gonna comment on that, said, Chuck, we should probably calm down. Let's settle down here. Let's talk about prison. Prisons a deterrent, it the punishment, and it's hopefully there's increasingly it's becoming a place of reform and rehabilitation. We'll talk about that a little bit um. But in the US, there's pretty much three three types of security levels for prison, right, yeah, with one extra little added measure that we'll talk about. It's a big extra though. Yeah, you got a minimum, you got medium, and you've got of course everyone's favorite maximum security prisons and uh minimums security prison were we're mainly going to cover maximum because that's really the most interesting. Even though I think they said like only or in max, is that right? Well, according to the two thousand five stats, but um, minimum is more like like a college campus that kind of thing. It's like that weekend that you did orientation at the college you eventually went to. I would think that's like minimum security prison, right, uh, And that's definitely non violent offenders with pretty clean criminal records, or may be you've served time in a medium and you were really good and they were like, yeah, let's bump this dude down to maximum a minimum. Yeah, right, right, then you've got medium, and that's the one that actually you you would see most um on like television shows or something, people think that's maximum, But when you see prisoners able to like move around and play cards and stuff like that, that's generally medium from what I understand. Right. Yeah, they have like dorm room style accommodations a lot of times with you know, eight or ten guys to a room. Um and like you said, the little social day rooms where they hang out and trade cigarettes and like on oz. Yeah, exactly do horrific things to one. We'll get to that too. Uh. And then of course the granddaddy of them all is the maximum security prison. These are the violent offenders, guys that have escaped or tried to escape. We're gonna say guys a lot. Yes, I think less than ten percent of the prison population is female. So it's not like we're not trying to give the ladies their due. We know you can do awful things as well, so props to you, but we're gonna say dudes a lot. Well, there's and then there's a subcategory that it was pretty rare. Um. That came about in nine three at the maximum security prison in um Marion, Illinois I think not Juliet Marian right um. Two guards were murdered in two separate incidents on the same day and the prison went into lockdown, which bad coincidence. Is that what they called it, and that's what I call it. The prison went into lockdown, which is where you're in your cell all day, you can't move around, you can't do anything, you have no freedom of movement. Um. And it remained in that state ever since. So it basically gave birth to the super max prison, right uh. And since then a lot of prisons have been opened as super max prisons during a state of lockdown, And if it sounds a bit familiar, basically the entire prison is a series of solitary confinements there the whole. Yeah, they call it officially, it's called Security Housing Unit and s h U, but everyone calls it the whole, just like in the movies. And as far as prisons go, solitary confinement and then especially supermax is extremely controversial, right. Um. Solitary confinement originally was created in eighteen thirty by a warden and a prison in Pennsylvania with the lofty goal of giving a convict nothing but time to contemplate what he'd done, the bad thing that he'd done. I think anything that was supposed in eighteen thirty is a good way to punish people. You might want to review that notion again here. And so, yeah, they basically found out that actually these are they don't sit around and think about all the bad they've done. They kind of go nuts, and not just kind of go nuts, They go clinically insane as anybody would, right, or they go in sort of insane and they really go off the deep ends. Right. Because prison has also and still remains used to um, how is the mentally ill at times, not as much or as overtly as before, but still you find the insane in prisons, right. Um. The other problem with a super max facility, besides the fact that it amounts to torture, psychological or otherwise, is that, um, these things, these places are reserved for the worst of the worst, supposedly, and in any given state there's a couple maybe of the worst of the worst. But a super max prison may have a couple hundred cells. Yeah, you gotta fill the cells somehow, so you have relatively minor offenses or convicts, um going into super max prisons, the killing themselves in a really horrible way. Yeah, this is a big build up in the nineties. I think they said by the end of the decade and of the nineties that um, thirty different states had a super max prison. Well, and you said that each state only has a handful of dudes that even qualify. So, like you said, they get put in there, they kind of go through a zoocosis of sorts, like weird behavior like the bears walking in circles. Um, except way way worse, way, way worse. This one guy in Wisconsin, he was a sixteen year old car thief. Another guy, twenty year old David Tracy, hanged himself in a Virginia supermax and he was nineteen and he had been there for two and a half years for selling drugs. No, he'd been there for a year and he had a two and a half year sentence and he still hung himself. He couldn't even make it a year, Kim halfway into a two and a half year sentence because he was immediately put in solitary confinement. Um, and then it gets worse. Apparently, UM people have um been known to swallow razor blades. One guy uh In in Indiana super max prison choked himself to death with a washcloth, and another guy, twenty one year old mentally ill prisoner in that same prison set himself on fire and later died from those wounds. Yeah. The good news, though, my friend, is that UM, a lot of supermaxes have been downgraded since then, Like the current trend is to downgrade your supermax to regular max. So they're kind of getting the message a little bit that we'd really don't need that to this many super max presents. Yeah, apparently the nineties were bad. Yeah, but there's only one federal supermax only one, which one a d X in Florence, Colorado. A d X Florence. But like you said, it's mostly on the state level. That's for like the really really bad tax evaders. I imagine a d X is not the kind of place you want to take a tour. I wouldn't think that the single federal supermax is not the kind of place you want to be. It's a chuck, You buddy, have just been popped, say, growing marijuana indoors, You're going to prison. Let's come to terms with that, Okay, okay. Um, there's a couple of ways that you actually get to prison, right, yeah, and there as follows. You can take a taxi, which apparently is more routine than we would imagine. I had no idea. Um, you can be dropped off by a friend or family member. That's what I would choose, as in I think that's what Edward Norton. I'd have my mom take me. Do you drop me off at prison? Right? Well? And um, you can also take the prison bus. Right It's called the diesel to Diesel tour because they'll you know, it's a prison bus. It's not like some luxury greyhound uh, bus liner. You know how nice as greyhounds are. Oh yeah, they're nice. It's not like that, you know that it's kind of cramped and nasty and smelly and it sounds like a a locker room on wheels. Well not just that. They you go take yourself to the sheriff's department and, um, you know, curse your family member for not being like, really, couldn't just take me the rest of the way to the prison. Um. So you get to the sheriff's department and you basically just wait there for the prison bus to come pick you up. And then you know, you stop at sheriff's department, after Sheriff's department, after Sheriff's department. That's the insulting part. Yeah, You're like, all right, can I go to prison? Can I just start this please? And they're like, well, we gotta make six stops from the way. Just hold on and the bus is going to break down in exactly a minute. We're gonna go pick up your future boyfriend first, so chuck. You um, finally get to prison, right, thank god, those cookies that your mom gave you have been taken away from you. I mean just immediately you didn't even get to eat one. They're chowing down on those, the guards are. And you have a new moniker. You have a new name, a new catch all name that describes you as a newly inducted prisoner. You're a fish. Yeah, yeah, just like in the movies. You know a lot of this. I thought, that's just like in the movies. And it is just like in the movies because they know a lot about prison. So why would you make a prison movie that was completely unrealistic right when you can make the real deal and it's very compelling. Yeah, and we'll talk about movies too, But yes, you are a fish, Josh. You're all your stuff is taken and cataloged, hopefully kept. We'll get to that later as well. Some of it might be lost along the way. Uh. You are allowed to bring in like your reading glasses and maybe a few books. No cookies, no cookies, you're legal papers if you you know, were into that. And so you're you're processed, right, and you're actually processed often in full view of other cons in the fish tank. And they call it, yeah, they call it the fish tank because all the guys who are already in prison can sit there and watch right. Um, but they keep you segregated for about thirty days or more. You had no idea what was that long? I didn't either. I thought they allowsed you. They sprayed you at the fire hose, gave you an orange jumpsuit and threw you in there. That's what I imagine. But yeah, no, for thirty days you're basically segregated. I imagine what the other fellas on the diesel tour you know, and um, you are assigned a job most likely, but you're about fish tank like you're on full display. Like for thirty days, dudes are sizing you up. Well, Like in Shaw Shank when they took bets on who was going to be the first gut, first fish to break down and cry that first night, it was that fat guy broke down and cry, and then he got beaten and bad things happen to him. I always confused that. In the Green Mile, I didn't like that one. No, Sean Shank was definitely better, but I often confused scenes they were shot almost exactly the same. Yeah, I agreed. So, uh, once you get out of your fish tank, you get your cell assignment, you may get your job right and again for about ten cents an hour. That's what you're paid. You should I read the letter real quick. There's actually a site on the web called prison talk dot com, and it's not as hot as you would think now, but you can go to forums there and read x cons and maybe even some current cons if you have internet access and like a minimum security talk about things on these is in forms. So I found a letter of I was digging around about jobs, and this one guy said the worst job he had was being a dorm janitor. He got paid forty cents a day. This is not by the hour. Forty cents a day, five days a week. There were four dorms total, about sixty guys in each, two bathrooms in each. You don't want to have a salaried prison job as a convict. I'm not sure if that hit home. Sixty guys sharing two bathrooms and this guy was in charge of cleaning that on a daily basis. I do appreciate you repeating that. So he swept off in he said he kept the dorm rooms clean. You've never seen a battleground of chaos until you've seen a bathroom after thirty guys take a shower, mud dirt, torn, tissue, blue State soap, so I guess they get SOAPA signed to them and never really thought about that. So anyway, tobacco spit in the in the hangout room, garbage um cigarette butts from roll ups. Basically, this dude had to clean that stuff up for forty cents a day and he said that was the worst job you ever had in for his all right, and he didn't even mention the fecal matter. Well, I think that's implicit. Well I just made an explicit check. Yes, So that is one example of a prison job that you can get um and then you're off to your room, which I would encourage everyone now to walk off eight ft by six ft wherever they are and get a good look at how large that is. And that's about the size of your prison cell. That's close to what we're at right now. Yeah, that's small, and that's a little claustrophobic. Usually, well it depends. The Most prison cells are designed for one guy, and then as prisons have grown increasingly overcrowded, they'll go and like bolt a bunk to another bunk to the wall, and then while I you have a cell for two, and then sometimes there's three. Whatever usually if it's designed to house more than um one or two people that it's a dorm and it can accommodate about eight guys per cell. Right yeah, I mean we could do a whole podcast on overcrowding and the issues there. That's like a very deep problem, but we'll just mention it and say it stinks. I'm beat literally and otherwise. Right, um, so chuck the You've got the general population cellblocks, right, which are all of the cell blocks aside from the fish tank and maximum security, which is also known as the whole right, and you've basically did you watch OZ a little bit? I think from what I understand that that's really accurate. I'm sure it is. So there's like a centrally located guard and like loose sight or whatever. They're like, you can't get through this, you know, operating the all the cell blocked doors and like letting people in and out, and they have a three and sixty degree view right well, and each one I thought this is interesting is fully each wing is fully staffed in case you need to lock down that wing. You've got all the dudes there, you need to take care of it, and it can be sealed off from the rest of the prison because apparently, um, the riot mob mentality can spread like wildfire among the president population. Yes, yeah, so um, and you would think, you know, people try to escape, which, by the way, there's a a double check. There's a stuff you missed in history class podcast about Alcatraz and the Great Escape. They Escape from Alcatraz, great movie. So if you want to learn more about that one, you can check that out, all right, if you're so inclined. Um, But to make sure that no one has escaped at any given point in time, they do counts through about the same time every day, probably the same time every day. They just do a head count where you have to line up and they say, okay, everybody's here. Then at night they walk around and count you while you're sleeping, right yeah. And then not only are you there, but you where you need to be. So if they say, well, Josh, you're in Chuck cell again, you know where you need to be, so they'll beat you down and take you to your own cell. Right, I'll feel like I need to be here, don't you hear our podcast? The Chuck is my partner. I wonder what the good fellas uh that had to be minimum or was that just a sweetheart deal? That was a sweetheart to remember when they were all in the same room, like cooking steaks. Yeah, the the one guy could slice the garlic so thin it was liquefying the oil so great. So Chuck, let's say, Um, you've become acclimated. You're no longer fish you. Um, you've shanked your first guy. Um, and you you're settled in for a nickel right, shank of verb? Yeah, it's shank is a verb, and and down and shiv is also another name for a shank, right, which is a homemade knife. Yes, okay, I just want to get that clear. I don't know that it is clear. Well, a shiv and a shank, I know, can both be nouns for the knife. But I've also heard that you can shank someone and you can show someone you can. I think they're both nouns and verbs very loosen prison for the same one. They're very understanding. Yes, with the vocabulary. Um, so you settled in and you are living your life in prison behind bars, you know. Um, it's it's I would imagine, fairly horrible. But there are bright and shining moments and those basically consist of the trip to the commissary, right, yeah, and I don't I didn't know this, they don't. You don't see this a lot in movies. All you see is the black market stuff. But there is actually a commissary where you can you have an account where you your little prison money goes into your account. They obviously don't give you cash, that wouldn't be a good idea. And uh, you go to the commissary and say, hey, I like, um, whatever is approved on the list, you know, like a pack of smokes and uh, People magazine and they're like, well that's you know, three and a half dollars, So go work for a month people from January? Yeah, who sexiest man alive? And actually they debit each Each prisoner has an ID card that is linked to basically their prison work account. That's when they say their their debited credits or given credits, and then it's debited from their account when you buy stuff from the commissary. I learned about that from Snoop Dogg. Really, so that's the fancy modern prisons have it all electronically hooked up, which makes sense. But um, like we said, there's also a black market which you have seen in every prison movie ever, there's dudes trading cigarettes for favors or for protection, or for better books or better people magazines or whatever. And there's also visits from out of doors. Yeah right, sure, you get the bad stuff in a lot of times. Again, good fellas, You remember Karen snuck in like those huge bagged pills. I mean just like like in her purse or in her bra or something. Yeah, they clearly didn't check her. Again, I think that they got special treatment and chuck. Um. One of the things that I would imagine goes for a pretty high price, you know, maybe a dozen cigarettes or so. Um is prison wine, right, Yeah, which prison wine? Pruno? Have you ever seen the site where the guy eats nasty things, Steve, Steve, don't eat it. I think it's called um. It is really funny and I saw this years ago. This guy made Pruno prison wine in his house and it's made with like fruits. It's sort of like a Sangree type of thing. Then you put like moldy bread in a sock and it's like soaking all together in a bag till it ferments, and it's imagine pretty disgusting. Steve said it wasn't that bad. He drank it. He did a white and a red. He said the white smelled like wrecked um, but he said it tasted just like alcohol. And he said the red actually wasn't that bad at all. He said, he said it tasted wine like and got him drunk, which is which is the deal? And uh so that that was the deal with Pruno. Wow. I wouldn't recommend trying in this at home, by the way, No, but that's the whole point. I mean, you're not at home, you're in prison, and you want to get drunk, so you make pruno. Yeah, unless someone wants to. Like you said, with visitation, you can sneak things in if you're you know, on the download, you're really not supposed to do that way you're not supposed to. You get searched. And um, and yes we are talking about visitation as well, now right. I didn't realize that, UM, visiting hours are basically like business hours. I thought it was like one day a month and everybody came at the same time on the same day. But that makes zero sense. UM. Prisoners are assigned a set number of visits per month, and I think the maximum number of visits you can get per month is for the most exemplary prisoner on the planet. Yeah, I would imagine that that's something that they take away pretty pretty routinely if you, you know, are being disciplined, yes, Josh. And you also have to have a list when you go in of who you say can and can't visit you. And if you're not on that list, you can eventually visit, but it's gonna take a long time and a lot of paperworking tape, yes, right, yeah, And I think you have unlimited visits from investigators, your lawyer and that's about it, right, Yeah, but they still keep track of all that and your search coming in the prisoner and the and the visitor both searched coming in and out. I don't know if it's full body cavity. It probably depends on the max level or your crime. I think kind of follows you around in prison, like what you did, what are you're convicted of? Like if you're convicted for smuggling things in your butt, check you a little more careful. And of course, now since we're talking about um, oh, and during visitation, like just regular visitation, right, um at a minimum security Remember this is just like college orientation weekend. Um, it looks like a waiting room. Um. And then in maximum security, visitation is like through that bulletproof class on the phone. Yeah, it's pretty accurate. And then there's a different kind of visitation that I think everybody likes to think about, at least thinks about whenever they hear prison. And that is kind of goal visitation, right, Yeah, it's it's one of the two ways that you can have sex in prison. Right. This is far more the um, the I guess more governmentally defended way of having sex in prison. UM. Conjugal visits Actually, we're UM originated in nineteen eighteen in Mississippi at a state prison in Mississippi, where they remain in effect. But originally they were created as a reward for hard work on the chain gangs and stuff right, well, and to incentivize them to work harder to write um. And it worked really really well. UM. Nowadays that's not used quite as UM overtly as an incentive or reward. UM. It is a reward for for good behavior or you have to be like, you know, the one who can get as many visits a month as one possibly can level of good behavior prisoner. But UM. It's generally defended in two ways. One is a basic human right, like you have a right to have sex even if you're incarcerated, just like you have a right to food and water and being kept clean, sure, right um. And then the other way, and this this appears to be much more legitimate in the eyes of the correction system. It's a way to maintain the family bonds throughout a stint in prisons. Right sweet. And that's what it's even officially called as the Extended Family Program, right, So it's not just about sex. Like you can have your whole family come over and barbecue. In some states it's UM. In Canada, I think they have there there. I guess visitation areas look like apartments have barbecues. There's such wisses you can have. You can have up to three UM family members at a time visit. Or you can just have your wife and it has to be your wife and you have to have been married before, because that's the whole point they want. They don't want you to turn into even more of a deviant than you were going in. They want you to keep talking to your wife and keep you know, loving your kids mean love by your kids. And to make that the transition back out into the normal world that much easier, right, Right, So, if you're one of those serial killers and you have one of those weirdos that writes you and you're marry and then you marry them, they can't come and visit you and have sex, right right, No, Okay? Now, Um, if you're gay, however, and you have a domestic partner and you are in Mexico City, Brazil, or California, you are entitled to conjugal visits as well, which is pretty significant in California because in two thousand seven you could have a conjugal visit if you were gay, but you couldn't get married if you were gay, thanks to Proposition eight, which was just overturned. Yeah yesterday. It's not over yet. The proposition night was overturned yesterday. Yeah. So that's the that's the skinny and conjugal visits not not quite as again like arrested development, I don't think, yeah, and they don't use it a whole lot anymore. They say it's pretty uncommon. There's only six states, right, yeah, but um, the one thing I thought was funny though, that one of the rules for the visiting um person is the dress appropriately and they said on the list of rules was no transparent clothing or bare middriffs, strapless attire, or anything with obscene or offensive language. So your wife can't get all dolled up in her baby doll lingerie. I don't know. I think they're like, can't you just put a trench coat on? Like everybody else? You know, have you not seen the movies exactly? And I think the mix that's it's a mixed bag on whether or not experts agree or they just agree and disagree, whether or not it actually serves a really good purpose. Well, yeah, and the studies on it have have shown mixed results about whether or not it prevents recitativism. Yeah, that's one bone head word. That's why s game a little bit that you should know, should know. But Josh Clark, so Chuck, you mentioned there's another way to have sex in prison, and this is one of the reasons I don't want to go to prison, because actually there's two more ways. Oh yeah, Well, you can have consensual sex with another man if you're in there, which doesn't necessarily mean you're homosexual. A lot of guys just there's nothing wrong with that, like, I just do that because they're in there. And uh, there's also rape that happens in prison. That's the reason I don't want to go to prison, just one reason. Uh. In two thousand seven, Josh, we have a statistic from the Bureau of Justice says four point five percent of state and federal prisoners reported being raped in the past year. And that is UM seventy thousand prisoners in a year. We're sexually abused by either guards or other inmates. See, that's all over the place, because there's other I've seen other numbers. UM one one two thousand four study found that zero point zero zero five percent even reported being raped while they were incarcerated, and then a lot of those were probably you know, untrue. Well that's the deal, is reported. That's the key. Like rape goes unreported a lot, just period, but it definitely goes unreported in prison because you don't want to be a snitch. Well sure, but no, I think these are people who have been let out already. Oh okay, yeah. But then in two thousand three, the year before UM, Congress created the Prison Rape Elimination Actors. You know about that UM and the number they used was thirteen pent and estimated of prisoners are raped during their incarceration and their goal is zero. Well, yeah, and they're like, you have to have a zero tolerance policy on UM inmate two inmate rape UM and guard to inmate or employee to inmate. Sure, rape that kind of thing too, because it's not just inmates raping one another. Guards at correctional facilities have been known to um be a little heavy handed and possibly psychotic themselves. Yeah. And I can say this because my cousin was a prison guard for a little while, a corrections officer. Cousin Wolfe. Was he high school grad? Well he had to be. Yeah, but you don't have to go to college to be a corrections officer, No, you don't. You just have to know how to shoot a shotgun. But to be the warden you do. Yes, okay, Josh. Let's say you're in prison and you commit a an offense or you're caught raping somebody. Under the new zero tolerance policy, Well, if you're caught raping someone or murdering someone, you would actually go to trial for real, guess. But if you're caught doing something a little less offensive, um, you can go to the whole. They can um remove your good behavior time, transfer you to to a scarier prison, or like you said, uh, limit your visiting hours that I'm sure that's a good way to dig back at a prisoner. So you can't get visits, um, and you get demerits called shots, and they log those to your little file. Yeah, and they take those into consideration when you're up for parole hearing or you're up to maybe get more visitations if if they're any time, they're looking at your behavior. Yeah, Um, they'll look at the shots and they follow you around. You don't want any shots. And that's official punishment. Is there's also unofficial punishment meted out by guards, right, Yeah. I would rather have the official punishment, I think, because just like in the movies, the guards can shake you down. They can quote unquote, um investigate what you have in your room, when what they're really doing is like destroying the things that you've grown to depend on to keep you saying, I know, have you ever seen Birdman of Alcatraz? Yeah, it's awful, and they take his birds away I know well, and then uh escape from Alcatraz. They took away the one eyes paints the old dude that painted. That was like the only thing he loved and they took away his canvas in his paints. Some jerk warden. It's always a jerk warden. Well, yeah, except Brewbaker. We'll talk about that too. Uh. And guards can also beat you down, and if nobody sees it and no one reports it, then it's just what happens. Well, I think it's I think that's officially sanctioned. I don't think that they have to get permission to beat you down. If I permiss, say, hey, this guy is getting a little ordinary, so I'm gonna break a river or too. But what I'm saying is I think they have a pretty wide berth as to what sanctions the beating and Grabmanowski put it, I'd like to I'd like to quote him here. It is not uncommon for guards to fire shotguns at prisoners whenever they see any commotion. Didn't understand that one, and I double checked, and it says at prisoners, not just fire shotguns like up in the air something. It's just like, hey, there's you guys are scuffling. Kaboom. Yeah, I don't know about that one. Yeah, this is indoors uh so like we said, Um, snitches are not you don't want to be a snitch in prison, And um, it's very much that mentality that you see in the movies where keep it quiet, don't rat on anyone, because if you do, then I mean, who knows what's going to happen. Uh, well, I can tell you it's gonna happen. You're likely to be shanked or shipped, which is the same thing, or raped and shaw shank. Yeah. Remember Andy's problem there with the with the sisters. Yeah, but he got back. That was one of the great redemption scenes of all time. I think the whole movie with great Oh no, I'm sorry, I was thinking of the Green Mile. Sorry, but the funny thing is is, and it's not funny to the guards, but they're way way more prisoners than guards. And every once in a while in history we've had these big uprisings where the prisoners have actually taken control of the prison. Yeah, if you work at a prison, you don't want to hear the word attica sounded out by like enchant form by one or even more one or two prisoners. Is that what they use now? Is that the signal? Well, I mean like that that means that there's violent unrest right around the corner. I thought that was a signal. Now was like attica, I don't know if it's a signal. Is more like a call to arms, you know, And all of a sudden there's toilet paper on fire and guys are coming at you and it's just not good. Yeah, that didn't work out too well. No, it was one right, And apparently Atteka Prison in upstate New York was really really deplorable as far as its treatment of the prisoners went, which is really saying something because their prisoners to begin with, and to have like the prisoners even know like you can't do this, Um, that's pretty bad. So they took a couple of guards hostage, rioted, um held them, and demanded for better treatment. And the State of New York was like, okay, all right, we hear you, and we're going to storm the prison. And I think thirty three people died. Uh no, thirty nine guards. Yeah, thirty nine guards and prisoners died. And that was in Many one. Um. And then there's one in New Mexico, right, Yeah. The New Mexico State pen uh near Santa Fe was another uprising, and that was where thirty three inmates were killed and no guards were killed, but seven of them were captured and beaten pretty severely, right, and apparently some of the inmates that were killed died from torture. Really just pleasant. I mean, think about it, Chuck. It's bad enough to go to prison, but one of the aspects of prison is that there's an end of your sentence, right, there's a light at the end of the tunnel if you can make it. Dying in prison is about as bad as it gets, especially dying of torture in prison. Would say it's pretty bad. So Josh, let's say you don't die. Let's see you serve your time and you do get out. What what what goes on there? Well, you would be like nine of all prison inmates get out. Yeah, which is one of the reasons why you want those family bonds in there, because you want to keep people on the up and up rather than Prison represents a real double edged sword. Either it reforms people or it makes them worse, and a lot of that depends on how a prisoners treated and the options get into them in prison. Um. One of the big trends now is education as part of rehabilitation. So I think every single state prison in the US UM offers a G. E. D course, and some of them require it for parole, which is good. Yeah. Right. There's also a vocational course, is that kind of thing? Right? Yes, But once again, like in shaw Shank, you can take that course and pass the test, but if you have a jerk warden, you still might get shot. You know, we should have done at the beginning of this podcast. We should have just said, everybody, go watch Shawshank Redemption. Everybody'll see you next week. Everyone loves that movie. Can we talk about the movies? Now? Are we there? Not quite? Okay? Um, Chuck. There's a lot of people out there who don't think that prisoners should just be left to rot, that they they're there should be prison reform, that there shouldn't be any rape, that that Congress shouldn't have had to have passed the law requiring zero tolerance on prison rape. Um. And there's actually been a prison reform movement going around since I think, uh, possibly earlier than that, I don't know. Yeah, the Quakers are huge on prison reform as well. Uh. And again, you want prison reform, you want your prisoners treated in a way where there is the potential for rehabilitation um because of recitativism, right, well, yeah, I mean that's why they pay them to work these jobs, because they want to give them some semblance of normal life so when they get out they can say, oh, well, I held a job in prison for the first time in my life. Maybe they were like a drug dealer, what have you. Right, well, think about it. Recitativism. The highest rate is among property offenses, and that is a crime of the poor, breaking into someone's house and stealing of stuff. Yeah, that's what you do when you're poor. Yeah, and that's got the highest rate of recentativism. So it would seem like some sort of education or occupational program wouldn't help deter that. Well. Yeah. But the other stat though, that kind of makes me feel weird, is that I think sixty seven of people who commit crimes to go back into prison it's an entirely different crime that they commit. Oh yeah, which was like that was really discouraging. I would think maybe if the guy just can't not steal TVs, he gets out and steal TVs, you would think, so at least go back to what he knows. But yeah, that's a little staggering. It is that would shut any Quaker up? And what what is the rate? I saw? I can't get like the most recent stat but it looks like between fifty and six somewhere in there from year to year for recidivism rates. Yeah, though in two and ninety four it was sixty seven point five, right. I think it's gone down since then. Yeah, And and that's surprising because the incarceration rates have gone down too, which is totally bucking a trend. I think, um, they're going down. That's what you said. Remember in two thousand five that these stats are based on, it was two million and changed to I'm sorry, it was two million, Um, one ninety three thousand prisoners in the US. You said it was less than two million in two thousand nine. Yeah, but I think that's people that are currently incarcerated. But that doesn't necessarily mean more people aren't being incarcerated on a daily basis, because I think that's true because the mandatory minimums. I think more people than ever are being incarcerated. So maybe that was people that had left. I don't know. Well, whatever it was, there was a two hundred seventy increase between two thousand. That's huge, and we spent I think fifty one billion dollars to incarceerate people in prison in jail, whereas um, I think that comes out to twenty nine thousand per per year. And remember a bail podcast. Uh it costs d and fifty doll was per in mate per year for probation. How much rather than twenty nine thousand dollars. But these minor offenses throwing these guys, especially like the car thief that was in a super max that was sixteen. Let me come on non violent offenses. You can rehabilitate that kids with some work. Alright, So, Chuck, I think it is movie time, don't you think so? Yes, Josh movies. I made a list of my favorites. Feel free to chime in. Shawshank Redemption that's number one for me, The Green Mile, and that's not mine. I've got Escape from Alcatraz because I saw that when I was a kid, and it's still like an awesome movie, Papion classic with the Dustin Hoffman with the glasses, with the glasses and and Steve McQueen, right, it was in the Great Escape to also a great person movie. H cool hand Luke was probably the funniest one of the lot, the longest yard. Actually, that might have been the funniest one. I never saw either of them. Really, You're nuts. Bad Boys Classic with Will Smion and the Sean Penn went about the juv detention. That's when Sean Penn was like, you know, nineteen years old and he was in juvenile detention and then he he filled a pillow case up with a soda cans and just annihilated this dude one night. Yeah, that's called a slock. By the way, Now that's when it's in a sock. Okay, I imagine this is me. It's called slaice. UM American History X. That was pretty brutal. Yeah, that was very brutal. Brew Baker, did you see that one. That's where Robert Redford went in undercover as a prisoner to sniff out how awful the prison was because he was going to be the next warden. You're talking about the natural And then most depressing, definitely Midnight Express for me, the Turkish prison one. Yeah, Midnight Run was pretty depressing. And um Animal Factory is the one I'm gonna say is the most realistic. I have not seen that one. That's the one that Steve Bushimmy directed and Um Edward for long and I think William dafoees in it. It's really good. And it's called Animal Factories, so you have a pretty good idea that it's realistic. I saw a Taxi to the Dark Side last night, and it's not. It's about the US's policies on torture and how he implemented him post nine eleven. But there's a lot of prison stuff in it, like Abu Grave and Bogram and stuff like that. It's pretty disturbing. Yeah, we didn't get into I mean, there's so much about prisons that we didn't get into here. We could do like three more podcasts if we wanted to, and if it seemed like we danced around something. Oh, I don't know. Capital Punishment, Yeah, I didn't go there. That's coming. I can't wait to do that one. It's gonna be sweeping. There's gonna be top hats and like people doing like the can can and stuff at the beginning. It's going to be enormous. Yeah, I think we have the rockets lined up for that list we do in prison Garbent. Yes, So Chuck's telling me he's given me the Double Ink, which means there is no listener mail. It was too long and too full of goodness. You know what that means. That means we just haven't gotten any listener mail. So we want to hear from you. Just type some stuff out that we would find interesting. Spanking on the bottom maybe yeah, talc it first and uh send it to stuff podcast at how stuff works dot com for more on this and thousands of other topics. Is it how stuff works dot com.
