Josh: Welcome to Stuff you Should Know, a production of I Heart Radio. Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, and there's Charles W. Chuck Bryant Chucker's Chuck tran Um. Yeah, I just spice it up a little bit with some multiple stuff. Uh. And no one else is here with us. We're we're alone out there in the ether, um, and this is stuff you should know. Although my prediction is, uh, you know, we started recording a bit early today since we're on our own. I bet guest producer Dave and short stuff producer Dave was going to chime in about five minutes. Okay, yeah, well look forward to hearing what he says. Uh, what's your deal with karaoke? I sort of know, but I think that people should know. We should, we should, we should exchange stories. Okay. I like karaoke. Um. I particularly like karaoke in the K Box, which we'll talk about, which is basically it's a little private karaoke room for you and your friends. Have some great memories um of karaoke like that. Um. But I'll do it in front of an audience if I get a drink or two in me, you know, not too much. Though you go too much, you start trying to, like, you know, fight the piano player or something like that. Uh. Oh, so like live karaoke. Yeah, I've mentioned it a couple of times, but Sig Gold's Request Room in Manhattan is the place to go for live piano karaoke. Um. It's just a beautiful, wonderful place. So if you haven't been there, go check it out. It's great, about as good as live karaoke gets, like live instrument karaoke. Alright, so I haven't been there. I will go still, I forget you know, I thought you would have gone this past year. Right, I haven't been there, never been in a k box, um no, never had the private kerrie. Uh. You know, we'll pronounce it karaoke even though it's kr a okay, cut out, okay, cut it okay, But we're not gonna do that. We're not because I think Dave Ruse helps us out. He's like, you can pronounce it correctly, but don't be expected to be invited out to karaoke night with your friends anymore, right after you practice your kata te right exactly. Uh so I um have done live karaoke a few years ago on my birthday. We went to the um, the one that has the rock band in the Virginia Highlands. I don't know that one. Yeah, I mean they have the full on band. It's rock and roll live karaoke. Uh. One of the local Atlanta DJ's English Nick is there to serve as um sort of a backup singer, and they can mix his vocals and more if you're really bad, because no one wants to hear that kind of thing. But I get up there and did Surrender by cheap Trick and he uh. I saw him at one point even stand away from the mic, and I was like, I've got this. Oh wow. He he like went and did something else. I maybe ate some corns tips or something, a tip of the cap. But my deal with Karrie Karie okay, is I used to be scared to death to try it, and that was when I had severe stage fright performance anxiety, which I completely got over because now I'm in a band that sings in front of people. You and I get on stage in front of people and it doesn't bother me anymore. I think I'd still probably be a little nervous to do like an acoustic open mic thing. Yeah, and you should be for a number of reasons. But uh, it's just funny how I used to be so scared and really overthink karaoke, like sit in the room, anxiety sweats, I really want to do it, but I won't put my name down, and then you know, the night comes and goes and I don't do it. Then I had this guilt and bad feelings. It was. It was a thing. Oh, I mean this was in my twenties and into my early thirties. I think when I moved to l a As when I really started. I guess it was in my twenties because when I moved to l As, when I uh finally did it, I was like, this is fine, and I sing better than a lot of these people. Yeah, it's a great feeling to to, you know, be done and have the people you're with be like I had no idea you could do that. That's really impressive. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah, I enjoy it. Thir Do you have a standard karaoke song that you you do or too? Yeah, I mean I usually try to do uh And I think we've talked about this under pressure by Queen and Bowie and I do kind of both parts at the same time you do like the Tibetan throat chaining kind of thing. But I I have made some mistakes too. I tried to do Foreigner as Cold as I said a friends uh not at their wedding but wedding weekend at a bar in Philly, and I just I was feeling it and was like, I had forgotten how high that song is. It was, Yeah, that can be a problem when you like starting your range but then you forget, Oh it keeps going up. That's a that's a real karaoke problem. And actually I saw a check that if you do that enough times you can get what it's called karaoke polyps, which are really Yeah, it's basically like polyps that grow on your vocal cords from straining your vocal cords by trying to sing like a professional without the training of a professional singer. So it can be deadly dangerous. Maybe not the deadly part, but it can be dangerous. Yeah, And I used to do the mental gymnastics of kind of like stepping outside and going through the song mentally real quick. Yeah, yeah, can I hit the parts for sure? For sure? And you should, I think, just as a responsible karaoke singer, you kind of do need to make sure that you can sing the song, because, yeah, it's kind of funny to you if you do a bad karaoke performance. But the point of karaoke is to like blow everybody's socks off. Like just just tear the roof off the suckers is kind of my personal motto every time I grab the mic. Yeah, and you know, I've had sometimes where I've seen some performances at the live karaoke thing. There was this country guy that clearly drives in from you know, country Georgia to do this, and he had a cowboy head on and he did want a dead or alive. You could tell that's his deal. He comes into the city, he crushes it, and then goes back to the farm the next day and everyone's like, who was that lonesome cowboy? Who was that mask stranger? It's pretty cool to see an everyday person just get up there and really kill it. Yeah, and I'm sure that guy has to go out of town because he probably get beat up at his town if he tried to do that there. You know, he's kind of like this, like being anonymous too kind of enables that karaoke Gusto, I think as well, Yeah, so you said something earlier. Um, you compared kado okay and kada te. And there's a good reason for that because karate karta ta means empty hand and um kado okay is actually short for kata oka. Man I even practice this kata okayta um, which is like romangi when when people in Japan take an English word and just kind of chapaint it up a little bit. So instead of orchestra, it's okaya and kata so it means empty in Okaya means orchestra, so it's an empty orchestra. And that's really what car karaoke. Kata okay is. It's it's slang for empty orchestra, and it actually predates the concept of karaoke that we think of today. Yeah, apparently in the early fifties that was a you know, a pit orchestra in Osaka. They said we want you know, I'm the army. Sure what they wanted, you would assume better wages or more bathroom breaks or something, and they went on strike and the theater replaced them with a sound system and it was from Matsuda like tronics, And apparently as the story goes executive from Matsuda came there, heard the system and said, it's uh, the orchestra. There's music playing about the orchestra pit is empty, and thus the term was coined empty orchestra. And that was that was in the fifties. Um, I think nineteen fifty two was it, Yes, so um. Karaoke as we understand it today didn't come along for good almost two decades later. So there was this idea that anytime you had prerecorded music, especially if it was played in instead of you know, where a live performer would play, UM, that that was karaoke kata okay um. So it was kind of a handy term that a guy named Desca in a way um used when he came up with karaoke. And the idea of who invented karaoke who came up with it is not just widely settled, but for the most part, there is like those who know site desk in a way as the as the guy who who actually came up with this as we understand it, Yeah, I did see. You know, there are a couple of other people in the late sixties that kind of messed around with machines that kind of did what what the karaoke machine does. But yeah, his story is great. He's a if you look him up a picture, he's a pretty cool looking customer. And in Osaka in the fifties, he was in high school and he was a drummer in a rock band and then tried to be a musician professionally for a little while, but like so many musicians that tried that for a little while, ended up back at home in his late twenties, living with his parents in Kobe. Yeah, but he gave it a good decade long try, you know, he was out on the road. I read this really great UM kind of mini biography or autobiography UM from the early two thousands that was published in the appendix is voice Hero to look that up. It's a really he's just a charming guy. Um. But he he tried it for about ten years and it just didn't work out because most of the money was pocketed by the older, more established musicians. UM, and it just he wasn't going anywhere. I think he said that he realized that no matter how much he practiced, and he really practiced, UM, he would never be as good as somebody who had natural talent and it just wasn't for him, so he decided to try something else. But he didn't want to give up um playing entirely. He wanted to try to make a living somehow from playing music, and it just so happens that his parents living in Kobe placed him at this really particularly good spot for karaoke to begin, which is Kobe, which is about thirty minutes outside of Osaka, um where the very famous Kobe beef comes from. And at the time in Kobe, and for a while before that, there was a popular pastime of singalongs, which is basically like you go to a bar a snack is what they were called, and there'd be somebody playing a piano or a guitar or something like that, and everybody would sing, you know, popular songs along with the mini band that was playing. Yeah, but that was like groups singing together, uh, not like a single person either delighting or embarrassing themselves. Um. But he got into this scene a little bit and it was clearly a popular thing. So he's like, I'm a musician. I guess he played piano too, and he learned a few hundred really popular songs on piano and then started performing as the accompaniments, accompaniments, accompaniment. I think that's the Latin plural accompaniments accompany down what's the word for the person the accompanist? Accompany is accompany minimust empotymus. None of these sound right, it's accompany list Okay, that just sounds weird to me. But you know how that your brain just broke it did a little bit. So he was doing this as the piano guy, the piano man, if you will, and one day this customer comes in who had been frequenting these nights where he was playing piano, and he was like, listen, I'm a business guy. I gotta go to a different city on the sales for the sales meeting, and I gotta take these uh these other people out to you know, to go out drinking and singing after and you're my guy. I can't like, I can only sing along with you. So would you mind recording something for me that I can bring along? And he said sure, So we recorded some stuff on a reel to reel, gave it to him. The trip was a big hit, and the guy came back and said I need more of these, and that was, you know, literally the aha moment. He grabbed desca in a way by his lapels and shook him and said, give me more, man, I need some more. And he did. And apparently right at this time, as he was being shaken, Desca left his body astro project elsewhere into the universe, where he was greeted by the same entity that Um that led to the creation of Ketchup, and the same entity has Ketchup and karaoke under its belt because it met with Daiskin said this is like, pay attention to what's happening right now, invent karaoke, and dasa Um basically came back to his body and said, I have I have this great idea. I'm going to invent a machine that is basically me what this guy wants me to do live that I can multiply create a bunch of different machines that do the same thing and it's going to be the first karaoke machine ever. And that's what he did. He came up with something called the Duke eight, which is a great name. Yeah, it's cool looking, I mean the idea and you can look at pictures of the guy with this thing and it's you know, it's about the size of a small guitar amp or something which is not bad. You'd think would be the size of like a smart car or something for the first prototype back in the day. But it was simple. I mean, they had amps at the time. They really just combined a few technologies, which was an eight track player right from a car, A car, a car eight track players where they started with oh yeah and a which are really no different than any other eight track players. I guess that's true. Yeah, yeah, I mean maybe they worked better in motion. I don't know, no, but that's probably why those cars were so big, because they had to be that big back in the day to hold the eight track track. Uh. So, you know, it was like an eight track player mixed with a you know, an amp or a p A, a small p A. And his ideas, you know, he called the juke e because it was kind of like a juke box, is that you would put money in it like a juke box to get a certain amount of time on the clock, which I think was kind of brilliant instead of like a song, um like, I think the idea is that people would just keep feeding it. Yeah. He actually specifically said that he chose five minutes a hundred yen about thirty five cents bought you five minutes of singing time so that you'd be part way through the second song and have to put more money and to finish the second song. He was he was a sharp tack in a lot of ways, well in some way, in some way. Uh So I think they took a couple of months to build each. Uh They cost him about four d and twenty five bucks, which is about today. And he said, I gotta get some of these tracks recorded. So he got a bunch of his friends to record, you know, musicians to record these instrumental tracks, started shopping it around and sold all eleven of those machines and pretty quick order. Yeah, I think. Um, I don't know if he sold them or if he took them as like basically, um a proof of conflict, yeah, something like that. Either way, he did get them in eleven different clubs around Kobe, um, and everybody was glad to have him there to look at. And that was about it. They just sat there and nobody did anything with him. Nobody knew quite what to do with them. And even if they did, I think it took you know how much gumption it takes in an established karaoke place when other people are doing it. Imagine being literally the first person to do karaoke like you probably would. You know, it just took a little bit. So, Um, Desica hired somebody, uh he said, a pretty girl in a sexy outfit is how he put it in that one autobiography, UM, and had her go around to all these eleven clubs and basically like sing karaoke. And she did it, um because he hired her too. But apparently she came back and was like, I would do that again just for fun. That was a lot of fun. And from that point on, basically the whole concept of karaoke took off, at least in Kobe. Yeah, there were about two hundred of these machines uh in and around Kobe uh in pretty short order. And I think it's a good time to take a break. I think it is too, because karaoke is just simmering that the lid is like rattling on the pot right now. Yeah, it's about to blow. All right, we'll be right back. Well, now we're on the road, driving in your truck. Want to learn a thing or two from Josh can Chuck. It's stuff you should know, all right, Okay, chuck. So there's a rendered fat spitting out the sides of the pot and steam going everywhere. I just burned my hand on it. Let's tear the lid off of this sucker, which is tangential to my karaoke motto of tearing the roof off the sucker. That's right. So they're going gangbusters in Kobe, and like you said, it's not too far from Osaka, which is a bigger city. And a couple of entrepreneurs from Kobe said, this is great, but we need to get this to Osaka, And they brought a duke eight around kind of showed it around and it really hit big to the tune of they were moving about twenty five thousand of these a year pretty quickly. Yeah. Because so remember I said that Kobe was like a perfect place for karaoke to to kind of be incubated, because people already did these sing alongs in Tokyo and Osaka. It wasn't like that they liked watching an actual band perform or listening to actual songs in the jukebox. Um. But when these guys, it could not find the name of this club, but that when they opened, essentially the first karaoke club in Osaka. Um. I guess it just hit at just the right chord, just the right time, and all of a sudden, Osaka was a karaoke town, and in very short order, Tokyo was as well. Um And because it kind of blew up for the first time in Osaka, Osaka is considered the birthplace of karaoke, even though it really was born in Kobe, like very plainly. Yeah. So you know you mentioned earlier that he was a pretty sharp tack in some ways, uh and others. And I'm not saying he wasn't smart, but he didn't patent the thing. His brother in law said he really should patent this Duke eight. He said, you know what, patent law is really complicated here in Japan. It's super expensive. Uh. You know, all I can patent is the business model because all of these you know, it's just a combination of other components that already have patents on the which is you know, I guess it's just different. I know, just from my Shark Tank viewing that in America, if you put together these different or any different technologies and just the right way, you can't get a patent, you know, not always but um, I've seen patents go through where I'm like, well, that's just this, this and this. They're like, yes, but we can bind them in the patent offense recognized it. Yeah, it's I think it's called an improvement or something like that. And I actually read this really interesting article chuck in a on magazine like I don't know, five six, seven years ago, um, where it basically made the case we stopped actually innovating we humans did back in maybe the sixties or seventies, and that everything we've invented since then it's basically just putting existing stuff together. And they used the example of the iPhone, which basically is like, it's amazing, it's this amazing technology, but it's you know, it's a camera, it's also a phone, it's also your email, it's also text. Like it's all these existing things just put together in one convenient place. Um. And that that's a really great example of how we actually stopped like creating new stuff and just basically repurposing, repackaging existing stuff, and that hopefully we're due for another huge technological advancement sometime soon if we don't, um, just decline from utter decadence before we get the chance to do that. Yeah. I remember there was a meme a few years ago or probably a little more than that, that showed up this the front page of a radio shack magazine at or whatever, and it was in at the bottom it said, all of these are now on your smartphone and it was like forty things, you know, from like tape recorders to microphones, to cameras to uh, you know thing, what's the thing that tells the temperature? The a an accompanist? But basically everything you know on that page is now on an iPhone. It's kind of like, well, and now I see why Radio Scheck is no longer around. Yeah, poor Radio Scheck. They really they did a lot there and they got kind of dissed at the end. It was pretty great. I love that story, it was and they had a really cool logo too. I agreed. Um. So, so you said that that he did not patent the karaoke machine the juke a right, Yeah, I mean he made plenty of money still though. Yeah. So yes, he's still manufactured juke case eight and sold them and you know, he sold tens of thousands of them a year and they were his machine. So basically for a long time until Base, until other competitors figured out that there wasn't a patent on this thing. Um, if you wanted a karaoke machine, you had to go to Daska in a way, right and buy one. So yes, he definitely made money, and he continued to make money over the decades and through the years, selling like UM equipment or UM cd s stuff like that. Right, So he was fine, and he actually seems very zen about this. But it is entirely clear that had he patented this, and I think this really kind of drove home to me just how globally popular karaoke is, he would have been a billionaire many times over just from inventing karaoke and kicking back and taking the royalties from the initial patent. He didn't like, I agree, though he didn't seem like that kind of guy from reading about him, it seemed because once you do that, your job then is is fighting people in court. Yeah, yeah, and that who wants to do that now? He didn't seem interested in it. He also wondered, I think in that one autobiography article, if it would have taken off UM had had he had a patent on it, it might not have just gotten as big as it was. I think that, you know, which is a pretty an argument in favor against intello intellectual property laws. But I think we should do in an episode just on intellectual property one day. Let's do it. Let's do it shot. Uh. You know who didn't feel that way was uh, an inventor from the Philippines name Roberto del Rosario, because he did get a patent on his karaoke singalong system in seventy five. Uh. And you know, I guess he'd I don't know his full story, but surely he knew what was going on with the Duke eight and knew that he could kind of capitalize on that. He I read a little bio on him, and apparently he claims that he had no idea about um karaoke as far as Japan is concerned, and that he invented it independently. So who knows about that. But he's also very frequently cited as an inventor of karaoke incorrectly. UM. And then there's another guy too, who will meet Actually, let's meet him right now. There's a guy named um k T kag Come on, so ka uh is a He was a Japanese businessman who happened to manufacture um karaoke machines and the reason that he's frequently cited as the inventor of karaokes because he and another guy named Earl Glick are the two men who introduced karaoke to the West through a machine debuting in two called the Singing Machine. Yeah, and we should say that. Uh. You know, Dave, one of our great writers, helped us put this together and he got a lot of this stuff from this point forward from a book by a man named Brian Raftery called it Don't Stop Believing Colin How karaoke conquered the World and changed My life. And I think this is kind of one of the seminal books on karia. That's the impression I have as well. Um, but you know it came to America, like you said, it had been spreading throughout Japan and obviously with international business travel in international travel period, it's the kind of thing that eventually made its way to the States. And uh, this film producer, producer of Children of the Corn was, Yeah, that's sort of his most most noteworthy movie because I mean, well he respect he was, Yeah, I mean I had respect for him, just being the head of how Roach Studios. How Roach Studios were responsible for Laurel and Hardy and our gang, the Little Rascals, but by the time Earl Glick was presiding over it, it was like basically teetering on bankruptcy and resting on its Laurels had no idea that he produced children of the Corn. So, yeah, mad respect to Earl Glick. So in nineteen eighty and again this is a great story. I hope it really went this way. He was on a cruise ship and he was playing blackjack, ran out of dough and needed to double down and needed more money because he had a great hand apparently, and there was like you said, a man named is it Kai or k k which is short for Kiso Kisu, so k is nearby. He said, here's three three large I can cover you on. That gave him three grand glick one and obviously that formed a friendship. He was like, you're you're a great guy just to give me three thousand dollars like yeah, and and k was like, you're a great guy to pay me back exactly, And they they bonded there on the cruise ship and when they hit Tokyo and docked. Uh. Takagi took Mr Glick back to his office, said, Hey, look at this karaoke thing. It's pretty great. You should get these going in the States. And Click was like, and I'm not so sure about this, but Takagi was not to be deterred, and over the next year would kind of send him sales figures to the point where Click was like, hey, there's some real money to be made here. Yeah, so so, I mean, at least in Japan. By this time, karaoke had been like a huge since station in Japan for a full decade, like it changed the culture. Um Deska in a way basically points to the invention of karaoke as like giving like all of these intensely overworked Japanese office workers a way to like blow off steam and like just feel better about themselves that they otherwise didn't have. So it really took off in Japan, but it was questionable whether it was going to take off in America. So it wasn't like a given thing that just because the sales figures were high in Japan that they were going to translate into America. And at first, actually that is how it went. When they came up with the singing Machine in two Um. Apparently kay Takagi would demonstrated on the street and get booed um because, as he recounted later, it seemed like the American public like took offense or was generally agitated when people who weren't professionals publicly performed music, and that was the whole basis of karaoke. It still is. It's reasonable though, Yeah, I mean, here's my deal, Like, if someone there can be a certain amount of bad that's still kind of entertaining and fun depends. But there's some that's so bad where it's just you're waiting and waiting for that song to end. It's just so painture, and that's when that's when you boom. You need to stop this. So there's a certain booing threshold for sure, especially when you know that they are essentially deliberately singing badly they deserve to be Yeah, yeah, Okay, that's a different thing. If someone is just super drunk and being really obnoxious too, and that's different. It's when they're trying and they're bad, that's when you shouldn't boo them because you will totally shatter their spirit forever. Yeah, So it's it's up to you as an individual to cast that judgment at that moment exactly. Just use it wisely, is all. That's right? Alright, So the it's not taking off quite yet, he's demonstrating it, like you said, not doing a good job, as legend has it. Click supposedly even took it to Frank Sinatra, who will figure in always figures in it karaoke, it seems like, and Frank was like, no, thank you. He said, what is this, huncle junk baby? You can you can do Sammy. I'll do Frank from now and OK. That was actually me doing a bad Phil Hartman impression of Frank Sinatra. Well, mine is just Billy Crystal doing doing Sammy Davis Jr. So oh, I like to think of you doing Sammy Davis Jr. Well, it's funny because, uh, Sammy was actually there. When Frank turned it down. He was like, I don't know, Matt, you could make some real dough with this thing. And Frank said, don't contradict me, Sammy, not in front of Click. Boy, that's pretty good. Phil Hartman, I think Joe Piscopo used to do it back in the day. Was great memory. He was doing some like um roundtable discussion about current topics or something, and say O'Connor was one of the panel members, and he kept call her the sign aide and q ball and like she she was like trying to have this, you know, legitimate conversation or whatever. He just kept dismissing her. Jan Hooks. I think, yeah, yeah, it was great. Great. That was back when he was really mad at her because she tore up the picture of the pope protesting abuse and it's like, maybe we should revisit that. Yeah, yeah, right, exactly. Yeah, you know, I think she was kind of right on, right on target. They're still around, I can't remember. I was reading about her not too long ago, and I mean she's still, if not putting out music, I think she's an artist at least she's still creating, still creating things. Uh So karaoke takes holden at least on the West coast. And I saw some places like we're going to cover the East Coast and the West coast. I saw that before this even happened. The Midwest. Yeah, did you see that? No? I was totally joking. Really, yeah. I saw an archive New York Times article about the place we're gonna talk about in man. Huh. And they said that it had already been sort of making the rounds in the Midwest because of Japanese autoworkers. Oh wow, that's really impressive. So but it was in the Midwest and no one knew about it. So yeah, So did this predate Dimples on the West coast though, or did it kind of also simultaneously go on in l A. Well, if Dimples, what year was Dimples Dimples? I have the impression was in the mid eighties. I would say probably let's go with eight. Five, No, no, I'm sorry. Seven is when it really took off. Well, the article in the New York Times was from eighty seven, and they said that it had already been a thing in the Midwest. Wow, that's that's really hats off to Peka for innovating with karaoke in the US. Probably Detroit maybe, I guess that's kind of where the Japanese auto manufacturing was back then. I wonder if it was Japanese executives coming over and talking about karaoke or American auto executives going over to Japan and learning about karaoke, then coming back to the Midwest and being like, let's do something tonight, right, I put on a bunch of mufflers today exactly, I'm ready to unwind and build something that's really interesting. Man, nice nugget. So Dimple's like we mentioned, it was until I think the mid two thousands of bar and Burbank. From what I saw, oh is that when it closed and in favor of a Whole Food to be built over the top of it. The Whole Food well they're multiple Whole Foods, so yeah, Whole Foods was built over the uh. So this is in Burbank right across from Warner Brothers Studios, and the owner their salth Ferraro, bought UM a bunch of these karaoke cassettes. He has started advertising like, Hey, where America's first karaoke karaoke bar. You're gonna love it. People didn't catch on at first, but they kind of took a page from the earlier days with dice K when they said, well, there are plenty of young, attractive UM actors and actresses out here, so let's just get some of those in to perform. And it took off. People like well, I want to be a star to r exactly. People started hitting the mini stage. So yeah, so this was Dimples was known as America's first karaoke bar, apparently incorrectly, but um, it certainly was America's first widely known karaoke bar because it was in l A. But it was extremely old fashioned in a lot of ways. Number One, there were no k boxes, which we'll talk about in a minute. It was you performing on stage in front of the whole bar. That's that's considered an old fashioned style karaoke bar. Number two, Um, you probably don't necessarily know every single lyric to the song you're singing, so they would hand you a book with laminated pages with the lyrics, so you would be reading from a big binder while you were trying to sing and perform at the same time. That's certainly very old fashioned. And then um also number three, Um, I think there were only two. Now that I say number three, I think it was those two that made it super old fashioned. So you perform in front of strangers, and then you had to read from a book. And so Dimples apparently really took off, and then karaoke also really took off around the world when they added something called C D plus G, which is compact disc plus graphics. Um. Oh, that was the third one. They would literally use eight tracks or cassettes of recorded karaoke music, and then all of a sudden the late eighties, you had a disc that you could buy had a whole bunch of karaoke songs, but then also it had a video component to it as well, so that you could see the lyrics on screen. And around the late eighties when karaoke as we know and love it today was was born. Yeah. I mean one of my favorite things still about karaoke is that sometimes it can still have that old school look with like a a nature scene like a waterfall behind it looks like it's like this looks like the late eighties up on screen in front of me. It's a delight. Yeah, or at least the early nineties, you know. Yeah. So that was the West Coast in New York. There was a place called sing Along that opened an eighty seven. And this was opened by I think like four people. Um Zack Smith, who was a drummer for Scandal, Um great band if you remember Scandal the Warrior, Yeah exactly, Um, and then an attorney named Mindy Burne Bomb and then Scandals manager David Donald Zuckerman. And we also should say that they sort of put it on the Western map. But there were places already in Manhattan. There was one in Chinatown called Lotus Blossom, another one at a restaurant called Ichiban. So there were some karaoke bars in Manhattan, but kind of like with everything else there, like and you know, history says, until it's introduced to like white America doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist. Maybe we'll mention it later in a retrospective thirty years exactly. So, but it did hit it big because of sing Along? So are you saying that sing Along Sprague karaoke in America more than Dibbles did? Okay, although they did franchise. I think they opened one in Buckhead here in Atlanta as the second one, is that right? And then so sing Along Um was also this place that innovated the kJ karaoke jockey. Not I couldn't help myself. That was totally involuntary. Yeah, um, but the kJ is the guy who um is like English Dan, who you know, gets everybody psyched up to come up on stage. English whoever, English Dan was a yacht rock guy. Right, I'd really like to see you tonight. Yeah, it was. It was the English Dan English nick Um was a kJ English Dan was the English Um that's a great song too. Um. But so the kJ was innovative at sing alongs to and you said the second sing along was in Buckhead, right, yeah, thinking then Chicago was next. So that would have been like the early nineties, because the late eighties saw like the the beginning of the entrenchment of karaoke, and then the spread really took off in the nineties and all of a sudden, it was like pop culture everywhere. Karaoke the first time for the first time in America in the nineties. Yeah, And it's funny to go back and read, Um. I know, Dave pulled a quote from the A. J. C Here in Atlanta, but to go back and read that New York Times article sort of describing what karaoke is is really very charged. I know what I'm saying. Contemporary journalism is so helpful. I love it. It's neat because they're like, you know, people get up on stage we have never seen before, and some people are bad and some people are great, but everyone has a good time. It's yeah, and so you know, people made fun of it, but it was still an extremely popular thing to do, typically like ladies night, trivia night, karaoke night. Like. It wasn't necessarily like a karaoke bar, but it was kind of everywhere. Um. But then there were places that where karaoke bars that started to spring up to um and apparently it started to hit on hard times in the nineties, at least the trend started to die out a little bit. I'm sure grunge had something to do with that. That was kind of a sea change when Grunge came along. But then American Idol actually revived karaoke like gang Busters basically, yeah, I think that's a good place for a nice little uh cliffhanger. Okay, okay, well we'll leave it. See what happens did American Idol last we'll find out right after this. Well, now we're on the road driving in your truck on learn a thing or two from Josh. Can chuck it you should know, all right, Okay, chuck lay it on them. Yeah, American Idol comes on the scene. Uh, it was huge. I mean, I'm not sure what their ratings are like these days, but in those early years, it was like one of the biggest TV shows in the history of American television, and it apparently revived karaoke because people were seeing regular folks get up on stage and sing. And I think that just sort of coincided with um people remembering like, hey, wait a minute, this karaoke thing that Kurt Cobain killed. Um that was kind of fun. Why are we too cool for school now? Exactly? Because I mean that that was I guess it kind of is what American idol is. You've got an accompanist playing and you're singing and that's yeah. So it kind of made people like get back into it a little bit. So, um that that was I think too. Thousand two was the season, the first season where Kelly Clarkson beat Dr Pepper's Little Sweet in the finals. Um, haven't you seen that Dr peppered with Little Sweet? It was a little sweet the run around, Yeah, just justin Guarini, Uh yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Um. So American idol was big and then that that was like regular America was like, oh yeah, let's go karaoke, and I forgot about that and then cool indie America, um got back into karaoke thanks to Lost in Translation. Yeah, you know the very famous scene in the Sofia Coppola film where Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson or in a k box having a lot of fun on their big night out in Tokyo. And uh, it's a really great movie and a great scene. Um, unlike all of the scenes and the two thousand film Duets one of the worst ever. And like, I mean, you know, obviously there's like um Absolution, the Journey or whatever, that Mario Lopez movie that Riff Tracks recently released. Like, there's obviously really really really bad movies out there. They're so bad they're almost unwatchable. Duets is bad, like on a on an offensive level that that it's really hard to put into words. It's so because they clearly sunk money, time, effort and thought into it, and it's still so bad. Like these other bad movies, somebody just pooped it out in like a couple of months. This is like a huge major motion picture and it's so bad that it's it almost like ticks me off just thinking about how bad that movie was and that it got released. Yeah, I never saw it. Um, if you don't know what we're talking about. This is the movie directed by Bruce Paltrow, starring his daughter, Gwyneth, Huey Lewis, Paul g Marty, Andre Brower, Scott Speedman, a bunch of people and it's literally about karaoke. And I watched the trailer today and now I have that stupid cruising song in my head and so yeah, yeah, that Geico commercial where they're on the moon gives me flashbacks of duets because that's like the main song that they sing in it. Yeah, I do have to say there's one thing where I didn't know is Bruce Paltrow that directs it. But um, there's a shot where Huey Lewis and I think Gwyneth Paltrow checking into a hotel and the it's like like the scene ends and Gwyneth Paltrow leaves the shot and Huey lose to stands there and he spikes the camera and blinked a couple of times, and you see more clearly than you ever possibly could, how blank it is inside of Hughey Lewis's head. You just see it. And maybe he's not blank all the time, but for that moment, he was totally blank. And it's great. It's one of the great shots of all time. But that movie just that's it's it's worthwhile. The whole movie is worthwhile just to see that one shot. But is it's so bad? I love Huey Lewis too, Yeah, me too. Nothing again, you gotta see it. But but loss in translation was the exact opposite of do what So that scene was Yes, yeah, it made it cool and hip again, like you said, and um, it was already kind of picking up steam anyway. But that definitely was like, well, a Bill Murray and wear an inside out T shirt and get up there and sing what was it Elvis Costello? I don't remember what he's saying. I think he did peace, love and understanding. Uh so that put it back on the map. And now I guess we need to talk a little bit about just the industry side of it, because you know, when you're putting hundreds and hundreds of songs out performed by different people, like these aren't the original versions there recorded by you know, uh, session players and session singers, because you always have that you know, sort of background track going. And there's a lot of money going, I mean karaoke. It's like a ten billion dollar in stree or something, and everyone gets a cut. Like if you wrote the song or perform the song, or if you have the publishing rights to the song. Everyone has to say it's okay to have my my song recorded for karaoke, and it's okay to have it performed, and each one there are different moneys that people have to pay. Yeah, there's a mechanical fee to actually record the song. There's a synchronization fee to um sync up the lyrics with it, any kind of video presentation. Um, there's a performance fee if it's not done in a K box, which I don't even know if we said a K box is just a little soundproof room that you can rent that's a private room for you and your friends or whatever to perform karaoke, and so you're not doing it in front of strangers. You don't have to wait for other people to go. You just go as often as you want. It is and then it's also it's just way more fun. And most karaoke places have k boxes now. Um, but if you're if you're not in a K box, if it's in front of people, you probably have to also pay a performance fee as well. Not you the karaoke person, but either the venue or the kJ or the company that's actually directing this because time was you used to have to get an eight track and everything was very tightly regulated. Now there's centralized servers basically that existing countries around the world that have these huge databases of karaoke songs to where if you go into a karaoke place, it's just hitting up a computer, probably in the Philippines or Malaysia or something like that, and it's sending back that song and the lyrics with it UM onto your video screen and through the sound system. So to keep up with all of that is really really difficult, And there's a lot of UM lawsuits that were that were UM filed. Probably the biggest one with Sony Music suing KTS Karaoke. They sued him for like one point to five billion dollars for copyright infringement. Yeah, I mean there's been plenty of lawsuits UM. And the same goes with and eat jukeboxes, and anytime you have a venue where people perform music, if there are cover songs performed and stuff, uh it to you know, it's a sort of a legal quagmire. And like you said, even more complicated these days when you can be UM sort of off book and just do like a YouTube version on a Wednesday night at the bar and sort of be off grid as far as people uh seeking money are concerned. But if you're a legit karaoke club, obviously you're doing it right. Or have a legit real karaoke night with a company coming in, they're doing it right, as in paying all the artists and stuff like that. But there are you know, some artists who have never signed away their rights. I think Springsteen is one. There are some people who used to, but now the songs have been removed, um like if you print songs. Bon Jovi, Aba, Coldplay have removed certain songs. Um maybe because of complications or because they couldn't get everyone on board. But if you used to sing a song and you come back a few years later and it's not available, that maybe why probably is So what's weird is that you would think would kill karaoke, but the burgeoning of the Internet and YouTube and just basically people creating karaoke songs at their house and being able to in like a home studio with just their laptop has actually kept it going. So karaoke doesn't seem to be going anywhere, although it does seem to be getting more and more removed from the group. There's a new thing called wankara, which is a solo karaoke singing box. There's room for one person in there, and that's all the rage in Japan right now. From what I understand. Maybe it's just like a practice. Nope, it's just I just want to sing because I want to sing. That's what it's been. I mean, you know, I bet, I'm sure there's been a person who's like, before I try my chops in front of people on Gon, rent one of these for my show. But I think there's also people who are like, all I want to do is wan car. I don't want to talk to any of you. Uh. There are home karaoke machines, obviously you can buy. There are apps now. Uh. One of the great delights of my life is when my brother sends me a smule song s m U l E. It's a singing app where he will be sitting in traffic and no record a full song and my brother's sing a better singer to me, and he'll just send me, like you know, I'll just get a text and it's attached, like here's a smule from Scott Bryant. I've not heard of that. It's great. I mean, I have it too, I don't use it much, but he's he's kind of a smule king and you can connect with other people to do duets and stuff like that you don't even know. So there's a whole community around it. So um, we I know we've talked about it before, but we can't stop until we talk about my Way killings and violence in general around karaoke because there has been Yeah, there there was something called the my Way killings, which we talked about in our is tone Deafness hereditary um episode um. But at least six people have been killed in the Philippines during or after a performance of my Way, Frank Sinatra's song my Way, UM. And there's all sorts of interpretations of why that my Way is a really popular song and so you know, and bar fights happened, so it just was coincidence. Other people are like, no, they really take my Way very seriously in the Philippines and if you sing it tone deaf, you're in trouble. Um. But it wasn't just my Way, apparently. John Denver's take Me Home Country Roads is one of the bloodiest songs of all time, right? Is that a murder trigger? I guess there was a guy in Thailand who killed eight of his neighbors, eight party goers at his next to our neighbor's house, one of whom was his brother in law because they would not stop singing and they sang take Me Home, Country Roads, and he went over and shot them all dead. I mean, clearly other stuff going on there. Yeah, he seemed a little high strung, but like it was the karaoke that had had pushed him over the edge for sure. Yeah. What do you think Frank would say about the my Way killings? You're gonna lighten up sometimes, baby. I'll tell you what they don't kill people two men is Mr Bojangles. You got that, right, Sammy? Uh yeah. And you know we should also mention too that it is huge in the Philippines, Like anywhere you go, almost in public, there might be it's sort of like the go into Nevada and you know there's a slot machine like every time you turn around, except there's someone singing. In the Philippines, Yeah, I mean, it's just it's huge. And Asia in general, you mean has this great story about how she would kind of, you know, go duck out and go to lunch and sing karaoke and go back to work afterward. Here there good stuff. Um, so you got anything else? Nothing else? All right? Well, if you want to know more about karaoke, just get up there and do it. It's not going to kill you, and you're gonna be happy that you did. And since I said you're gonna be happy, that means it's time for a listener mail of course. Uh. This is from a new fifteen year old fan. Hey, guys, big fan of the show, writing to say, Hi, just turned fifteen. I'm from California. I started listening in December, so I'm fairly new, but you guys so quickly become my number one show. Multiple times. I've heard y'all say that you lose listeners around high school. About it here to assure you that there are high school listeners out here anyway. A big reason why I love the show is because all the seemingly boring topics you cover. There's so many ordinary things that we take for granted that have uh such an interesting history, like bar codes, for instance. That has been one of my favorite episodes so far. I'm glad that Natalie saying this because that's something that we love about the show is our episodes like ballpoint pens and bar codes. You know, yeah that seemed boring but turn out to be fascinating. Love it. Just today I was asked for a random fact. I was able to talk about the failure of the Pony Express thanks to you, guys. I also want to say thank you to everyone and stuff you should know for keeping the show so enthralling yet educational and like so many other listeners have helped me through the tough times. I can always counting you for laughter, education and tangents, one of my favorite parts of the show. Uh and then a final little, very kind correction, and we welcome those. It's been very unkindlyly. Uh Yeah. So it almost feels like there's a new breed of listener who's like, look, I don't know who you jerks are, but I think you're jerks. And here's everything I think that you're a jerk about. There's been a lot of that. I think it's uh, I don't know what it is. Maybe the pandemic wearing on people here. It could be we've gone two waves of that though, where we'll get like a new swath of listeners and then like six months later we'll hear from a lot of them again and be like, look, I'm really sorry about that first email. I really I can't do without you guys. Yeah, you still don't know what you're talking about a lot of the times, but but I find endearing. Now it's weird, uh. She Natalie listened to the Walrus episode. I'm sure you got email about this, but wanted to make sure you knew the beach creatures by the Hearst Castle that you thought were sea lions are elephant seals. And that is Natalie last name redacted. And she says, p s. Don't be dumb. Was a great series. It was nice. I don't know that anyone else ever wrote in to correct that, So thanks a lot, Natalie. Nicely done. Totally. Um, that was a great email, Natalie, perfectly done. Welcome to the fold and good luck with high school.
