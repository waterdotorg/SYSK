Josh: Brought to you by the reinvented two thousand twelve camera. It's ready. Are you welcome to Stuff you should know from House Stuff Works dot Com? Hey, and welcome to the podcast. I'm Josh Clark, Charles W. Chuck, Bryan's with me. If my my nose doesn't deceive me, I didn't do my cheeks today, that's bad luck. Now, thank you. I don't think that that's gonna save this episode, but it will make it from being the worst, probably like the one, the unreleased one. Yeah, in case of brake, we'll make that when we retire, that will be our final episode, will go out of the whimper. That's not bad idea. Yeah, there's a lost episode everyone that only Jerry, Chuck and I know about, in case of emergency breake Glass episode. It is so bad that if if something happens, we we released the emergency episodes. Right. Yeah. That feels good to have, does it? Yeah? Yeah, I guess so. I feel like we have a margin of error, but of one. Um, All right, Chuck, let's get this started, all right. You stink, I stink, We all stink. Jerry doesn't stink. Jerry smells like lilac. She does. Um, but the wow, you just threw me off with that one. But your stink and my stink are unique. Um, it's like, um uh it's called an oder type, right, So an oder type is, as I said, very unique. It's uh so unique that there is research into figuring out how to identify somebody through their odor. Yeah. I thought that was interesting. It's like a smelly fingerprint. Yeah. Um. And no matter what you do, it can't be masked, like you can't alter it to where a machine that's designed to molecularly and allies odors can't say oh it's Josh, Oh there's chuck. And they're also they're really laying on the Polo cologne today for some reason because this that was my man. I remember the day I did you wear that bottle of Polo? It is like the size of my torso and I was so excited. I only wore one cologne in my life for like two years in high school. Yeah, Benetton Colors it was. But um, I haven't worn cologne since literally I was seventeen. Yeah. I went through maybe like three periods of my life where I worked cologne for a little while, and then finally I'm like, I don't wear cologne? What am I doing? Not? Not many guys do anymore? Do they? Yeah? Really? At the gym I go to, it's like get out of the sauna. Now, Wow, it's bad. Yeah, when I told you, I think one time when I lived in Arizona for a year. It may be cultural, but those dudes work alogne like a lot and hair jail, don't they. Um, I seem to remember a fair amount of depitty do Yeah, Arizona is like New Jersey West, So anyway, we all have very distinct odor types, is what it's called. Oh and not only can you not alter it to with the machine, but if you're a mouse and you're trying to mask your scent, other other mice can still see who you are through their Yeah, I saw that that study. Should we tell them that the technique they use, even though I don't understand it involves tickling uh volatile b ocs like you get in paint, volatile organic compounds also in your body, which is just something that turns to gas at what we consider room temperature exactly. They use they can analyze uh, these scents in your sweat, saliva, and urine using gas chromatography, mass spectrauma spectrometry. That's good stuff. I'm glad you got hung up on that. Yeah. I don't know how that works, so I didn't have enough time to look into that. But that's what the Pentagon and the Homeland Security are using to try and snip out terrorists and also apparently to figure out if someone's lying because there's different kinds of sweat. There's different kinds of sweat glands. Um as you know, we've actually kind of covered some of this. Remember we did what's the difference between any perse print and deodorants? Again? Yes, okay, I didn't think that was me. I mean you were wildly impressed with Like I had a theory about, um, deodorant stocks going up. Remember hormones and milk are making kids hit puberty younger in my opinion. Uh, and then with global warming, people are going to need more deodorants, so theodorant stocks were the way to go. Um, that's not as good as my early man theory. What happened? They melted? So happened to the Neanderthals? These are the old days. Yeah, I think that theodor one was like one of the ten minutes shows, wasn't it. It It was pretty quick, like really early. Yeah, but we're going to revisit it because even you don't remember it, and you were in it, I remember right now. Um, So we're gonna talk about the different kinds of sweat clans because we've also talked about this before and what can you sweat colors? Yeah? Okay, but let's let's do it again. You want to? That was the introduction. That's great, I love it. Um. You know, they also have studies that that say that little babies are more attracted to their mothers obviously because of their scent and like early on humans can sniff out their parents, which is and I don't think it's a theory of mine. I think it's pretty well established that if you're like a smoker, even if you're like, oh I don't smoke around my kids, they still sniff that stuff out and they are more likely to smoke later on because of that. Is that true? Yeah? Oh yeah, children of smokers are way more likely to smoke. I know in studies of um babies born eyeless and as worms, they will like they'll sniff their parents out and like just wiggle over toward them even though they can't see usually can't hear. It's a neat study. Um, there's a lot of stuff in here like that. Um, so let's talk about the different kinds of sweat glands. You got echrone glands. Yeah, those are my favorite, same here because they cool me off. Yeah, they're innocuous. They basically just secrete water and electrolytes, which if you've seen um idiocracy, you know how important electrolytes are. Um and yeah, it's used to regulate body temperature. Your hypothalamus says, hey, you're getting a little warm here. Let's get rid of this perspiration. The water, the the the water and electrolytes on your skin. When they evaporate, it's going to cool you down. And I love it. And sweat doesn't stink. I think we've pointed that out before, but it bears repeating. The sweat itself is not smelly. And I like saying that because for obvious reasons, it's well established that I'm a sweaty guy. But I'm not a smelly guy. No, you really aren't. I was thinking about this. I'm like, I was. I was thinking about you as I was researching this, and I was like, you know, Chuck doesn't smell. I've never I've never smelled chuck. And I've been around you when you're sweating. I've been around you when you were wearing nothing but like shorts and a Hawks jersey sweating. Sah, well, you better be sweating if you're wearing that. Yeah, that's because I take exactly, That's because I take care of myself and do all the things that we're gonna talk about, like bathing. Yes, So in ekorne sweat um, there's nothing to smell. Electro LTEs don't smell in the other sweat gland and ecorn sweat glands are found all over your body. The other sweat glands epicrine like sweat glands, they don't smell either. I know what you're saying. Like that, you you produce sweat, but it has a lot more than just water and electrolytes chuck. Anytime a cell excretes waste, poop something out, or is destroyed through maybe autolycens or whatever, there's a lot of little um cellular detrius and that stuff has to leave the body because you don't want it to build up. You want to get rid of your broken up dead cells, and they enter secretory cells in the skin and hike along with your sweat. So the apricrine sweat is a means of disposal, cellular detritus disposal in your body. But even that doesn't smell. Yeah, what produces the smell? Uh well, And we did cover this before, but it is bacteria that basically eats those proteins that we sweat out and then they poop them out. Essentially, they poop out fatty acids that stink. That's the smell. It's not us, it's the local flora, the bacteria. I don't even like the word flora, I know, and it doesn't even make sense because bacteria aren't plants, and even if they were plants, um flora apparently refers to multicellular plants. Yeah, but they call local flora bacteria's local flora um and a little protozoa on your body, those are called fauna local fauna. And I can't figure out why. Uh well, I bet the answers out there. I looked, man, really, Yeah, if anybody knows that this is the one I'd really like to know from this episode. Well, what we do know is that these nasty applecrine glands are found in some pretty unfortunate places like you're growing or you're growing and your armpits um, your what is it the and your hands and your feet, So that's where you're gonna smell um in your feet. Interestingly, the reason they don't smell quite like your armpits is because they also produce fungus in addition to the bacteria pooping out batty acids. Yeah, and that's why your footot is going to be a little different. It's not really coincidence that, like all of these places are hairy, well except for your hands. Yeah, and I guess the soles of your feet, but your armpits and your groin are hairy. I'm five years old, loves naturally they're hairy. Um, and uh, when we wear shoes, were in socks whatever. Where we are providing like these great places for bacteria to thrive and eat the stuff to their hearts content. But it takes about an hour apparently. Yeah, that's a good news. So when you start sweating apricrine cell detrius through your armpits um, you it takes about an hour for the local bacteria to digest. I mean they'll eat it immediately, but then they lay around, have they wake up and they're like, I got a poop and they poop and then you start smelling. Um the other gross thing, and there will be many gross things, but to me, one of the gross things is the the ekron glands secrete kind of you know, clear liquid, but the apicrin glands excrete liquid that can be thicker and milky and hello, which is why if you've ever had the old mustard stains on the undershirt, which are really unsightly they are, that means it's time to get rid of that undershirt, or if you're like me, then it's time to keep wearing it until it's crunchy. Yes, and I know the crunch you're talking about. Yeah, I think that's the deodorant as well, I hope, so in combination with the milky yellowish secretions. Yeah, uh yeah, so that that's the gross stuff. That's where your pit stains come from. UM and the smell. Also one of the big guys of the smell world as far as the waste products that the local flora are producing is um E three methyl two hexanoic acid. That's what's making you smell, friends, that's the one. It's one of. And the bacteria that's producing this are called microcoxie or staphylocoxie. And um, like I said, this is where they love living in your pits. Um, And I don't know if like they live in our armpits, like over time they've become attracted to human armpits the revolution, like they're like, oh, well this is where we eat, so we live here. Um. And they never learned you should never poop where you eat. They do the whole gam but you know, um, or poop where you live? Um, but it's poop where you eat. I think it's both, is it? Yeah? Okay? Um? I wonder if like they were attracted to humans over time, because I mean, are we born with these things in our under arms? I don't know how do we pick them up? How? How soon after birth do we pick them up? Well, I don't think we're born because newborn babies don't have the ap aprican sweat. So that's why little babies smell delicious. And unless they're pooping, which is like an ungodly thing such what is wrong with babies? So yes, you're right, Um, we we aren't born with apricream glance. We develop them around puberty. You probably won't start the body out or of the b o um as my mom always called it, until until puberty, till your teen years, and that's when you start getting stinky and um. So it's not just there's not just a difference between little kids, between teens and tweens, right, tweens on stink teen stink um. Supposedly there's a distinction among um races. This is highly controversial, is it? Yes, it's not nearly as cavalier as it might seem in this article. You can't just say like, oh, well, Asians are the least stinky um. There's there's supposedly here's the problem. Okay, here's the problem that the field of anthropology has with this. It's possible that there are differences among among races, but you can break it, don't even further? Is it um? Is? Is it food based? Is a diet based? Like? Is it? So if you are in northern India you're eating less curry in southern India India or vice versa. I can't whatever, So are all Indians? Did all Indians share a similar smell that's more pungent than say Europeans. The it you can't and even within that, it's like, how many vegetarians are there that hate curry in India? Well, the reason you point out curry, we should point out is because that's mentioned specifically in the article as one of the more highly um pungent foods that will eventually come out in your sweat exactly like garlic. Right. Um. But the the I guess the point is is, um, when you differentiate among people, whether it's smell, especially if something is unpleasant as body odor, then you are you're creating a disparity. You're propagating the possibility of racist stattitudes because if this person is different from me and how we smell, how else is that person different? You know, maybe I don't really like that person. Well it's not even endorsement. Well you just well you have to be careful with Plus the other problem is is most of the research that that is cited um these days for difference among races and body odor was last compiled in like the nineteen thirties. And then also for example, like Asians have fewer axillary glands, do they? I don't know when's the last time anyone checked. And then some of the other old data suggests that half and estimated half of Koreans don't even have axillary glands, so they couldn't even sweat if they tried. You know, you see the point. So you're saying it's just hinky data, it's old data, and you're not supposed to cite data over ten years old. Well, why don't we just as a as a show, as a part of the public specter, say, some people stink some and some people don't. Yeah, people are people, Some stink somet' so why should it a be jerry like that one she saw her that. Um, men definitely, uh are are stinkier than women in general. We don't mind a little sexism, especially when we're throwing it on ourselves as stinky men. But it's not sexism because it's true and it's not. I mean, there's no there's no disparaging that comes along with that. That's true. Um. But and this is actually backed up by some science. We have more testosterone, which is gonna up your production of the apricree sweat. I'm just gonna lead to stinkiness. Um. Another theory is that women are more efficient regulators of their body temperature because they have less core heat going on because less muscle and fat than us dudes. And conversely, you can make the case that men are more efficient at um cooling there themselves. Yet true because women don't just tell sweat as much. And I thought this was really interesting, and so did Emily because I was throwing some stuff at her today while I was researching when men actually need one degree higher body temperature in order to start sweating to begin with. Yeah, I thought that was interesting and must be significant. I found it sounding hypothesis that that face unners attached to that. That's that women have less body fluid than men and so have evolved to sweat less. And so that would be the mechanism that that that evolution is taken the form of well lucky ladies, is what I say. But what's interesting is no, because if you are working out and your lady you suffer, you stay hotter longer, you get hotter. Um. And there's a study in Japan of all places, because they can't even sweat, you know, um that where they found that um women could train themselves just by working out a bunch like forming a workout routine over time to start sweating earlier, um than women who were just like working out for the first time got you. Yeah, well, since you brought up Japan, this is a sidebar, but we'll throw it in there. Um. And I thought this is interesting. Apparently they take their their sweating and their stink pretty seriously over there, because they have a couple of interesting products. One company, um Aoki, has developed a deodorant suit that uses uh fabric with silver ions impregnated in it to fight off this bacteria just by wearing it right. And then they think they have determined. A cosmetic company thinks they have found the fatty acid responsible for old people smell, which I thought was really mean to say. And uh, no, Neil is the fatty acid. And in Japan they call old people smell carry issue and they are trying to combat that. And I guess grandkids all over the world they're just gonna be like spraying their grandparents when they walk in or when you inherit the house, you just walk around and spray carry issue. Uh. It's interesting though. I went over to my mom's last night and I realized that her home that it's not the house I grew up in. This is She's been there for a while though, um, probably fifteen years. It smells like my grandparents house that I went through growing up in Tennessee. That's interesting, like a lot like it, And I don't know. I mean, it's gotta have something to do with heredity or maybe products or furniture that you have some of their stuff, do it. Odor types are genetically um based, Yeah, so, I mean it would make sense that your mom inherited some of her ODO type from her parents. It's what. It was very comforting though. I was like, wow, oh yeah, man, I'll bet granddaddy'suse you unless your grandparents stunk like ox and I'm sure it's very comforting even more were abusive and hated my guts. You're like the scent of Guardinia makes you like drop into the fetal position. You never hear that of like abusive grandparents. That's like, that would be the worst thing ever. I'm sure there are some you gotta be out there, yeah, yeah, but you don't hear about it much. Thank god, thank god, everybody. It keeps that secret. I've been around some mean old people though, so you know what, everyone has that capacity. It's true, and that's why I quit boy Scouts and protest. Oh no, I just didn't like the idea of respecting your elders. No matter what. I was like, no has to earn respect. Agreed, Thank you. Alright, I finally vindicated after all these years. Um. We did talk about this in another podcast about women able to pick up um. I think when we talked about it before, it was a study about women able to pick up clues through scent about whether or not someone's a good reproductive partner. Like that there they would have a different immune system than you together in form of super baby, definitely one that wasn't born without eyes with a worm like body. UM. We also kind of debunked that, yeah were The research we found is that like we don't even have the capacity to um detect for modains any longer, most most humans don't. So like that whole idea is a little um. There was there was it's it's hit or miss, Like there's some studies that suggested, yes, this is true, others that didn't. If you read the um the release though on this study that this guy is talking about. Yeah, the guy just like the researchers just totally leapt to a conclusion. They were like women can differentiate, Like it's tougher to mask um a man's odor to a woman and he basically said, ergo, women can detect body odor better, which means that they must be detecting like something like immune system robustness or something. It was like, where did you get this extra stuff? You know, it's drive me crazy. I'm on a tirade today. Research. Yeah, I'm sorry, everyone, I'm I'm very sorry. Well, speaking of that leads us right into this article. Actually, we're we like to point out when our own articles aren't quite up to snuff. And there were a few interesting things and it's a shame that we can't find verification on these, because I thought it was interesting, really interesting. Um. A tribe in New Guinea says goodbye to each other by rubbing each other's armpits before they leave, and so you can keep a little piece of the other person to sniff. That was really sweet. It's not a bit gross. And you said that it might be bunk like I found. I found virtually no support for this, and everything I found was like not a reliable thing. Um. And then Austrian tyrol, which is a very specific place to bus about, but um, they supposedly men would dance with handkerchiefs in there tucked under their arms and their armpits, and I guess, work up a real sweat, and then be like you and point to the girl he was going for and wave the handkerchief under and knows she would swoon, and they get married and have babies in that order. Didn't find verification for that either, right, No, same same thing. But I found even less for that. What about the last one? This one appears to be true, all right. I misinterpreted this because I told Emily this one this morning that in Elizabethan times they would soak peeled apples in their armpits sweat and give them to their lover when they parted, and I, for some reason, took the lead to mean that they would eat them, and I thought it was a grossest thing I ever heard. And Emily was like, no, I don't think they eat them. I think they just keep them. But they're they're called love apples, by the way, Well that's not what I call love apples. What do you call love apples? Apples that you know you give to the teacher on their desk? Yuh, because it seems odd that's an apple for the teacher's not love love apples because you love your teacher. Huh Um, were you home schooled by your mom? Wasn't? Uh, but my dad was my principle. Um, I don't know. Did they eat them? I'm sure some sick ate them. And how the oscar wilde ate them? How did they collect enough? How do they collect enough underarmed sweat to soak them? Is what I want to know. Oh he was Victorian, This is Elizabethan Um soak it up in a hanky and ring it out? Maybe I think they just sat there for a while and like, um, but it doesn't like drip out if you're dripping rub it around all right, who knows, we'll try it. We'll try and make a video of it. Oh so maybe they would rub the apple on their under arm. That would make sense. Yeah, I imagine they collected and just like hover over a table with an apple on it. Well no, I imagine they collected the under armed sweat in a dish and then soaked it in that. But that's why I was thinking. Just ignore me for the rest of the show. What was it? Was it kids in the hall where they had like some guy's body odor was so beautiful that like they had this guy like some perfume company bought him. Basically and they had him running on a treadmill and it was either Mr. Show or Kids in the Hall. It was hilarious. Not cabbage Head clearly. No. You know it was like a segment, like an additional segment. You know that you can tell where they're like, they put some money into it. Oh yeah, yeah, alright, where are we? Um? Oh? I did think this was interesting. The term b o, of course, comes from an advertising agency that didn't surprise me at all. Nineteen nineteen um Odo Rono deodorant. They and I love how this ad goes. Remember that wonderful man you met, the way he danced, and the telephone number he asked for and never used. You should take the arm whole Odo test stinky, Yeah, like a stinky woman. That's why the man didn't call you back, eighteen year old spinster. So yeah. Products in nineteen nineteen were not afraid to be uh sexist jerks. No, and I went back and I remember the spec ind Um. They released a product called mom and Um. Think back with me to the anti perse a deodorant one Um. You had to apply it with like a swab on a stick, and it worked, but it also would like burn a hole through your clothes and that was the first deodorant, right, yes, Mom, I think it was still around for a while. Well, Tussy, what was that? I don't know? Or what was the sprinkle a day one? Uh, just a sprinkle a day for feed? Have you had your sprinkle to day? It was like a general body deodorant. I don't think it sprinkling your body like gold bond. Yeah. I like the gold bond though. Oh yeah, that's a lifesaver with certain things. So so Chuck, Yes, have you ever seen um that one Simpsons where the Homer and Marge have their kids taken away from them and they have to go to the government parenting class. That's what this next segment is going to feel. Like, what do you do if you um find that you have body odor? Well, um, one thing you can do, Josh, because interestingly, um animals would use their scent to broadcast and it would scent would get tangled up in the hair, so we'd stick around a little longer. So obviously if you have hair and like you're growing, what you do and your under arms, so I could pointing out the smell is gonna stick around longer. So if you keep that area trim then, um, you're less likely to have odor in those places. Yes, that's good advice. And I'm a I'm a believer in keeping your body neat as a general rule, regardless of the scent factor. You know, take care of yourself, well, yeah, may manage your your hair, your ear hair, your nose hair. And there is nothing shameful about a man getting a manicure and or petticure. Okay, Uh, that was supportive. Well, I mean it has nothing to do with body under sure, there's nothing taking care of yourself. Well, I don't have I bite my finger and else, so there's really kind of no point for me. You know, remember Carrie Grant took a bunch of acid. Well they Uncle John's Bathroom Reader published like a list of like some of his best quotes while he was tripping, and the psychiatrists like wrote him down. And one of them was, if I have to look at him, man, shouldn't he have to comb his hair and brush his teeth? So Carrie Grant was a big time into taking care of yourself to him, and look what happened to him. He had a long, successful life exactly. He's an acting legend. Bathing Josh we said, it takes an hour for the bacteria to do its thing. And so if you've got you know, you've got a big interview or something, you a little nervous, take that shower less than an hour. Yeah, because I don't know if we mentioned this. Um Ekran sweat is triggered by body temperature. Epicrine sweat gland is triggered by emotion. Yeah we didn't. We didn't. Actually, anxiety specifically is a big one that makes you start sweating. Yeah. Boy, I sweated a lot when I interviewed here. Oh my god. It was July. Yeah, me too, and it was so and I couldn't figure out where this building was. Kind only just said like park it it's like by at Lenox parked Atlantics Mall And walked in like a hundred degree heat means like half mile and was like my shirt was like a dark blue even though it's supposed to be light blue. And I'm like, hey, I'm here to be interviewed. But I remember the shirt I wore two and it was light blue, which was a big mistake. I don't know what I was thinking. And I have not dressed that nice at this job since that day, which is I think I should go at every job. Wait a minute, you are you wearing a suit? Brown? No? No, I should punch you for saying that I didn't wear a tie or anything. And you know it's like a nice shirt and pants. But look at me now, I'm glad you didn't punch me. By the way, Um, what are some natural remedies Josh to avoiding this kind of thing? If you're not into the chemicals? Boric acid? Tony Mule Team are good friends a Towny Mule Team? Uh, sprinkle a little powder under the arms. Yeah, it's actually a low level acid. Yeah, and I think probably what it does is just makes your armpits inhospitable local flora. There you go. Yeah. Vinegar, which is just like the most amazing thing in the history of the world. Do you drink that stuff now? I mean Lea's vinegar for like everything. You mean, It's got me into like drinking diluted vinegar, drinking it today, weed killer and kill weeds, you know, like big time? Uh, like any not any, but many many chemical remedies. I bet you if you look up on these homespun websites, some kind of vinegar might help you help you out as well. Well, it's changing the pH. Any time you change the pH, that's something's accustomed to, it's probably going to just die. Which hazel, Yeah, I like that smell, do you? I can't stand it. I like it baking soda. Um. As the article points out, it works in your fridge, so it'll work on your armpits. I've never done, ideally theoretically rosemary oil. Yeah, dilute that in some water, little sprinkle on your under arms. Have you done that one? You know? It does work those um tea tree oil because it's an antimicrobial, right, so it's just gonna go in there and destroy everything it sees. That'll dry out pimples to a big time. Um. Well, since we're on deodorant, we might as well talk about some of the controversies with any personant. Well, let's just give a brief overview of the difference between the two. That's the difference between deodorant and any personant. Well, uh, any persprit um contains kim things like aluminum and what's the other one. Aluminium is the big one. Hydro hydro hydroxy broma, hydroxy bromide, and they will essentially close up your sweat glands so they don't work. It plugs them for a little while. And not only no eventually, like I mean they they it is overall temporary, but the length of time between the application and the time you would start sweating again becomes longer and longer with with UM repeated use, because it actually shuts down your apricrine gland like it plugs, it swells it and basically says, all right, I'm done trying. I worry about it something. To be honest, a lot of people do a lot of which is a lot. Yeah, yeah, that's a lot, dude. Um. And yeah, there's there's been plenty of studies that have linked um aluminum to breast cancer. Yeah, and aluminiums have been shown to mutate UM cells into cancer cells, but there's never been like the smoking gun, like, oh, yes, this person has breast cancer because they use deodorant. Well, yeah, and the cancers are hard to nail that too, because there are so many things that could be contributing and there's so many different types of cancers exactly. Uh. And then also with what Alzheimer's. Yeah, but I think that's just a general link, a general tenuous link between Alzheimer's and aluminum. I'm surprised that the studies are from the nineteen sixties. Surely they've done something since then. I don't know. I think everybody's been focused on b P A S really well, all the breast cancer links are they're newer than that. But there's just no one's been able to produce a study that's definitively linked deodorance or any person pants, I should say to breast cancer. Um, but there's a strong correlation. Um. There are chalky deodorants, there are the liquid jelly types. You don't see the aerosols anymore, thank god, right, Uh. And then there's the disgusting roll on that I'm not sure who uses still I don't know either. Didn't Tussie make a roll on? I think so band band was big. I think they innovated the roll on stick. Uh. And then also we should say deodorants are they're they're different from any press prints, and that they don't stop you from sweating, but they make it so that when all your cell detritus reach is the skin surface in your under arms, there's no local Florida eat it and then produce terrible smells as a waste. Um. Tom's of Maine. It's very popular natural deodorant. I love that apricaant one that my underarms laugh at. Yeah. Uh. And then the crystal stuff that makes um, makes your own arms too salty for the bacteria live. Right, it's like a mineral crystal deodorant. I've never used this, so, um, do you want to talk about any of that? That's not necessarily body odor from sweating? But there are some other smells that one can produce, like asparagus p If you, um, are interested in learning about why asparagus can make your pee smell, you should check out our video podcast because we explained it. That's right, you specifically explained it. We did it together, and I think it was it. Only a percentage of people believe that there smells. Don't don't give don't give it away, okay, Um, But if you want to find that, you can find it on iTunes just look for stuff you should know his video podcast, that's right. Um. You can also find it on our ss feed on how stuff Works. It's short and uh, kind of fun, like we're having a good time doing them, and they're really loosen, like, man, they're so loose. Yeah, the things we're getting away with saying I don't think people understand um. Yeah, so okay, um, Oh so you've got asparagus p you have UM maple syrup urine disorder. We've talked about that too. Yeah. It's a real thing, and there's no other clinical term for it, like that is the name of it. And it's actually kind of a big deal. Like you have problems with your metabolism, it's a metabolic disease UM, and these amino acids can build up and kill you if you're not careful. Yeah, and it's in kids, and I think adults UM have a similar condition. You can make it to adulthood, but it won't smell like maple syrup anymoretal like say it you say burnt sugar. I'm not sure what that's like. Um, you've never surely like, um, oh what's that wonderful dessert crimble, Oh well that's lovely. Yeah, okay, yeah, No, it's complaining about the smell of their pea, but it's very worrisome, you know. Um. If you are around a diabetic a person with diabetes UM who suffers from keto acidosis, you might say that they smell a bit like nail polish. Removering that their breath smells kind of fruity and like juicy fruit, kind of gotcha. Um. And then what else chuck fish oulder syndrome. Yeah. Um, that means you lack the ability to metabolize something called t M A and that apparently smell like fish. I don't know what kind of fish, but it's fishy. Yeah. And that's pretty Um what do they call that? I'm daring you to try and say that word. Try and methyl m and euria nice, thank you? That is the word. That's um, that's the name primary trimethyl amin urea. And that is the condition which means you can't metabolize the t m A and that means you will smell like fish. Yeah. And then if you have phennel ken turneria, you might have a barn like smell, musty barn like smell. Can you imagine if you had the fish odor disease you sweat blue, and you had that condition that makes your face silver, what kind of life would that be? That'd be a heck of a ride. I'm praying that none of those things are compatible. I mean it's possible. The blueskin thing that's just from too much copper, right, so there could be some comorbidity. Silver silver, silver, yeah, sweat blue. I got nothing else. Well, hyperhydrosis Just for my friends out there who suffer from hyperhydrosis. I don't think I have hyper hydrosis. That's like I'm just extra sweaty. Hyper Hydrosis is really really abnormally high, like these sad cases you hear about, and it can be men and women where your palms literally sweat all the time, just like leaking water. Um, and you can there's a variety of things you can do to treat that, from surgery to uh ion to paresis, which is using electrical an electrical current to disable your sweat glands. Right. You can also have them surgically removed. I wouldn't mind that from the neck up really, yeah, because that's where my sweat bothers me. I don't mind like sweaty body. But when you're like, you know, you can get boat toox to fix that, nothings. Well, it works. Um. There's also I do have one more thing, brome hydrophobia. I thought that was interesting. So it's the fear of sweating. I al thought it was a fear of stink. Oh yeah, you're right. And the fear of stinking from sweating. Brome hydrosis is yeah your body owner, Yeah, yeah, you're right, chu um. And somebody who suffer from rome hydrophobia will take a lot of showers every day, to the point where it's been linked akin to O c D. But there's no other behavior except for you know, taking showers or trying to or your fear of smelling. It's not you're not You're not messing with light switches or anything else too. It's just this fear of smelling. I had that with poop smell specifically. Oh man, if I walk in the bathroom and someone's taking care of things, I like leave immediately. Or I will often put my shirt over my nose and I do that when I clean out the litter box, and when I do the dog poop on the walks, I put my shirt. I can't stand that. Yeah, because anybody has seen the Ice Storm knows that, like, those are the volatile organic compounds of your poop that you're smelling. That's what the odor is. It's what was that about Ice Storm? I've seen that movie ten times. Some kids says that like in like a school report or reything like that, and from that part. I've never seen the movie and I know that. Oh man, it's great. Yeah, Angley great director of the Hulk. Yeah. Um, so what else? I got nothing else? Let's stop talking about this then, yes, please if you like this one. There's a surprising amount of stuff about sweating on how stuff Works dot com, uh, sweating colors, the difference between any personant and deodorant, and come listen to those old podcasts are good too. Um, and there's just a lot of sweating stuff if you have sweating problems. I personally wrote it a lot of sweating things too, didn't you. Um no, no, there's ironically there's a push about remember that stuff. Um. But just type sweating s W E A T I n G in the search bar how stuff works dot common. That will bring up some cool stuff, I said, search bar, which means it's time for listener mail. Josh, I'm gonna call this one on guard I think that's a funny one, hey, guys. Through college I was really active and fencing, the sport generated by the ancient rules and honor code. You guys mentioned. One interesting symptom from engaging and fencing through UH though, was an ultra critical eye on swordplay shown in films. Movies like Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Highlander are examples of what is called quote show fencing, the art of making the largest, flashiest attacks without ever threatening either actor. Um show fencing is sometimes slanged as Flynning after Errol Flynn or Mark Hambling Cameling. Um he says that Errol Flynn pioneered this technique. Yeah, he's a swashbucklet to us, and still is. I think, well, he's good. He lives on though as a swashbuckling. Um. If you or your listeners want to see excellent representations of Hollywood showing true fencing, I have two recommendations. First is the black and white version of The Three Musketeers. I think it's from I can guess the other one Riding in Cars with Boys, How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. The rapier duel on the staircase at the tail end of the film is still admired of some of the best fencing on film to this day. The other film I'd recommend, and we got a few people tell us about this one is Ridley Scott's uh directorial Premier ninety seven, The Duellists, based on the true story of two Napoleon Area Area Napoleon era French officers with a feud lasting for decades. The film accurately shows multiple types of duels and weapons, including foil uh, cavalry, saber pistols just to name of you, fo foils, the really thin long thin fencing. How gonna go out in a limb and say that without looking it up? Well, we got some coffections coming to anyway. The film is simply a must for those who want to see great fencing and accurate dueling. Um. And that is from Josh. That's from me. Yeah, thanks me, thanks. While we're on this, um, that joke my memory, the dueling UM reminded me of a movie that we well, not not just a movie, Wow, I'm a hic, a movie and a book um that we left out of the Revenge podcast, the Count of Monte Cristo. I don't know how we did that, because that is like the quintessential Revenge plots. Yeah, that's true. That And also I want to say in the beer episode, I wrongly attributed the super human happiness to one of the guys in the bands for Human Happiness, when really it was a super fan named Kurt Schlachter. So sorry, Kurt. Well, and since we're on that, you also called New Belgium new Amsterdam. Oh yeah, that was a big one. I'm really sorry. Guys. They've even sent us peer before New Belgium makers of fine Fat tire sixteen sixty four. Now that's Cronenberg. Let's just stop right here. And you do have to pay all kinds of money for covering songs too, of the way, that was completely wrong. Okay, yeah, that was a huge sidebar in the Yeah, like they would spell it out like, no, you don't have to spend money to that's crazy, that's wrong. Okay, well good, so I feel clean, like we just purged ourselves of all the correct Yeah. And not only that, I didn't realize this, but clubs that have like cover bands that play there actually pay like yearly licensing fees just so they can have like the Kiss tribute band play. Oh man, so I don't think the band plays. I think it's up to the club to take ownership with that. People will pay anything to have the Kiss tribute band play, especially if it's Strutter. Yeah, that's all them. So let's see if you're related to a member of the band Strutter or Kiss, or you have a correction for us, send it along. Just don't be a jerkoin you do um.
